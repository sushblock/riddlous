One day he was setting off to go hunting.

He realized he left his gun at home, and so, he couldn't shoot the magnificent creature. Out of habit he raised his cane, aimed it at the animal as if it was his favorite hunting rifle, and yelled 'bang bang'. Miraculously, two shots rang out and the beaver fell dead.\"\n\n\"Now, what do you think of that?\" asked the doctor.\n\nThe 86-year-old replied, \"Logic would strongly suggest that somebody else pumped a few rounds into that beaver.\"\n\nThe doctor replied, \"My point exactly.\"\n",

        "body": " After many years of\nwandering, he finally arrived in a small village in\nthe middle of nowhere. The people there\nbelieved in the same religion as he did, but they\nhad no church; they had to go to the nearest one\nwhich was in a small town 25 km's from there.\nThe priest took the initiative, asked the Church\nfor support, and with the help of the local men\nthey built their own temple. From there on, he\nwas celebrating the Sunday masses, joining\ntogether men and women in Holy Matrimony, and\nsaying prayers at the funerals.\nMany years passed by like that.\nAt the end of an ordinary mass, in early spring,\non a chilly Sunday morning he was just guiding\nthe people out of the church, was about to close\nthe gates when an unknown man stepped into\nthe churchyard.\nWith his dirty and torn clothes, he stood before\nthe priest and said:\nPriest, please be good and give me half a lemon!\n- the priest was a good man, and even though he\nthought the request was a bit strange, he went\nback to the rectory, took out a lemon, cut it in\nhalf, took it back to the man and gave it to him,\nwho looked back to the priest with gratitude.\nHowever, the priest was curious. He asked:\nSon, why do you need this half of a lemon? - with\na fright on his face, and before the priest could\nhave said a thing, he rushed out of the\nchurchyard gate and took off.\nA week later, around the same time, when the\npriest was leaving the church, he found himself\nin front of the same man in the churchyard. The\nman said:\nPriest, please be good and give me half a lemon!\n- the priest was surprised by the appearance of\nthe man and his strange request. Of course he\nwas good, went back to the rectory, and brought\nthe half lemon. Placed it in the stranger's hand\nand immediately he asked:\nHere it is, my dear son, but please tell me why\ndo you need this half a lemon? - the man was\nobviously frightened and immediately ran away\nbut the priest was not sluggish either and ran\nafter him. He wasn't in a very good condition, he\nhas never run so much and so fast before so he\nwas out of breath by the end of the village,\nalmost fainted. He thought the strange man\nmight appear again next week, and it would be\nnice if he could keep up with him, so he spent\nhis week working on his cardio. It turned out to\nbe a good idea, because as he thought, the\nstranger entered the churchyard on Sunday. The\npriest didn't even wait for the request, he was\ngood, and brought the half lemon. He received\nthese words from the man:\nThank you priest for being so good and giving me\nhalf a lemon.\nDon't mention it son, -said the priest- but please\ntell me, what do you need it for?! - by the time\nhe finished his sentence the man was already\nrunning, but the priest was close behind. They\nwere running for a while and the priest was\nstarting to feel exhausted when they arrived at a\nwide and swift river. The stranger without\nthinking threw himself into the river and swam\nacross the river and disappeared on the other\nside. The priest didn't follow because he couldn't\nswim. He was annoyed when he got home. He\nspent the next week learning to swim at the\nswimming pool in the small town 25 km's away.\nHe was anxiously waiting for the next Sunday;\nnow he was sure that the weird fellow would\nvisit again. On Sunday, as he was closing the\nchurch, the gate creaked, and entered the man:\nPriest, please be good and give me half a lemon!\n- the priest was good, went back, put on his\nswimming trunks, his running shoes, grabbed half\nof the lemon and took it to the stranger:\nHere it is, my son, but please tell me already,\nwhy do you need it? - the guy was terrified,\nrushed out the gate with the priest following.\nReached the river, swam across, the priest right\nbehind him. He kept running on the other side of\nthe river and the priest was still on his tail. They\nkept running until they got to a tall tree on the\nverge of a deep ravine. The man climbed the\ntree with the agility of a cat, the priest not\nknowing how to climb a tree, stood on the\nground. He was cursing everything as he walked\nback home. The following week the villagers\nwatched as the priest in the garden of the\nchurch climbs trees, jumping back and forth, and\ngenerally behaving very strangely. The priest\ndidn't care, he was exercising obsessively,\npreparing himself for the meeting. On Sunday\nbefore the mass, he put on his trunks and\nrunning shoes under his cassock. In fact, he was\ngood and put half a lemon in his pocket in\nadvance. The mass finished much earlier than\nusually, and he emptied the church as soon as\npossible so he could warm up. In the same exact\ntime the mass should have ended, the strange\nman entered the churchyard.\nPriest, please be good... - the priest was already\nhanding him half of a lemon, and asked:\nSon, why do you need it for God's sake? - the\nman ran away terrified, the priest followed him.\nThey ran to the river, swam across, ran to the\ntree, climbed up. The priest almost catched the\nstranger when he grabbed a vine and swung to\nthe other side of the ravine. The priest was\nabout to have a stroke, but then he saw another\nvine. Whoop, he grabbed it and swung across.\nThere, however, he encountered an unexpected\nobstacle: it was a plane graveyard and the man\nclosed himself in one of the wreckages. The\npriest was raging as he walked around the\nwreckage several times, but he found no\nentrance except for the sealed door on the side\nof the plane; he had to open it somehow. He\nwas furious but he went home. He spent every\nday at the village's locksmith and learned every\npossible way of opening a lock. On Sunday he\nheld the mass in his swimming trunks, running\nshoes, on his back in a waterproof backpack was\na crowbar, a cutting torch, a wrench and a drill,\nthen he stood in front of the church and waited\nfor the man. He was there on time.\nPriest, please be good and give me half a lemon!\nThere you go, son - handing him the lemon,\nbecause he was good, but in the same time he\ngrabbed the stranger's arm, pulled him close, and\nwith obsession in his eyes, asked:\nBut what do you need it for?! - panic came over\nthe man as he made his escape from the\npriest's hands and ran away, but the priest was\nvery close behind. Racing to the river they\nquickly got across, running up the tree almost\nbreaking their necks, one after the other swung\nacross the ravine, the man barely managed to\nclose the door of the wreckege in the priest's\nface. Little did he know that the priest would not\nstop there, because he grabbed his backpack\nand started working on the lock with his tools. In\nless than an hour the heavy door creaked open.\nInside, the stranger was shivering in horror, he\nwas afraid of the priest's fierce and triumphant\nlook. The priest slowly strode up to the man,\ncrouched down, and very quietly, with a friendly\nsmile on his face, gently asked:\nSon. You have been asking for half a lemon for\nthe last few weeks. I'm very happy to give it to\nyou, even in the future, I am only asking in return\nthat you tell me: why do you need it?\nAll right, priest ... - came the answer in a\ntrembling tone - I will answer your question, but\nplease, be good, and do not tell anyone.\nThe priest was good, and never told anyone.",

Here's the evidence: Do you really believe that the Rams and Eagles would give up that much for unknown quarterbacks if the draft was real? I sure don't. They did it because the NFL promised them victories and records if they made this draft drama happen. They did it because the NFL will make sure these two young men are successes, unless they want them to be busts. If they want that, they'll set the poor guys up like they did with Johnny Football, RG3 (though this one had way more drama!!!!), David Carr, Ryan Leaf, Jamarcus Russell, and so many more! The only one who tried to go off script was Tim Tebow, and he got blacklisted for it!!! There is also no way that Laremy Tunsil would post a video of himself smoking pot... unless the NFL told him to for more ratings on draft day. He seems like a smart young guy, he wouldn't do it if the league was real. Too bad, the NFL will probably have him arrested for \"drug possession\" in a year or two. And now the best evidence, I will predict some more drama today (though if the NFL sees this, they'll change the script to make me seem like the crazy one, LOL). Maybe Myles Jack will have some troubles aside from his injuries? Or something like that. So anyways, the only real winner yesterday was the only real team left, the New England Patriots. The NFL and Goodell are trying to stomp out any REAL integrity by bringing them down with (fake) penalties. But it's okay, because the great New England Patriots can see through the haze to win the Superbowl. Goodell wants to take the best QB ever away? Fine, we have a future Hall of Fame QB waiting to take over. You want to give the (cheater) Broncos the Super Bowl for Payton 'HGH' Manning's birthday? Fine, at least we won where it counts. And you can bet your a** that there will be HUNDREDS of \"questionable\" calls against the great New England Patriots this year, but we'll overcome and win the entire thing again!",

But that can be a problem as the government runs out of money for all the retirement pensions. So the government outfitted some of our cars with these cross hairs and we are asked to take out some really old senior citizens should the opportunity arise!\" \n\nThe guy is dumbfounded. \"Unbelievable\", he says. \"I have never heard of anything quite like that.\" \n\nA few minutes pass and suddenly, the taxi driver notices an old lady on the sidewalk in front of them.

If you can take a hit, hold it in, and swim underwater all the way around that island out there and back without coming up for air, I'll let you have another hit!\"\n\nEven though this seems like an impossible task (the island is at least a 1/4 mile from the shore), the frog agrees - after all he'll get at least one free toke. So he takes an almighty hit from the joint, and starts swimming. The Sativa power of this weed must have given him Shiva's super strength or some such shit, because he makes it all the way around the island and back, before popping his head out in front of the fox and breathing a cloud of smoke out of his red-eyed little face.\n\nThe fox, now pretty stoned, bursts out in laughter at this. \n\n\"Oh my god man, I can't believe you actually made it! I'm so impressed, that I'll do you the same deal again. You make it, you get a third free hit!\"\n\nThe frog shrugs, takes a moment to get his breath back, then hits the joint like a hero and dives in. But this time, he gets halfway round the island and realizes there's no way in Hell he's going to make it. He surfaces, breathes out, and through the dissipating smoke he sees the silhouette of a hippopotamus. \n\n\"Hey there little guy!\" says the hippo, \"that smoke smells dank as your mamma's sweet ass, you got any spare nugs fam?\"\n\nCoughing and spluttering, the frog says \"No, but, uuuuuh there's this cool fox over on the shore that can sort you out!\"\n\n\"Nice one bruv!\" says the hippo, dives down, and swims towards the shore to find the fox.\n\nHe surfaces right in front of the fox, and before he can get a word in, the fox screams:\n\n\"Oh my dear god, exhale the smoke, EXHALE THE SMOKE GODDAMMIT!!!!\"",

(Genies don't like you to ask for something easy, or gross, challenge them you know?)\n\nBear all this time, what little their was, is thinking about all that sweet bear action he is going to get, and he gets hornier and hornier, finally blurting out,\n\n\"I wish every other bear in the country, was a hot lady bear who wanted my sweaty bear balls.\"\n\nGenie is even more disgusted, this time with himself, knowing in a single generation or two, bears will be nearly gone from this country, but being a servant he grants the wish, and bear sees a lady bear coming into the clearing and goes to her, and starts doing what comes naturally to a horny bear.\n\nRabbit, opposed to watching this, is checking out his sweet new ride, and notices he is missing something.  He turns to the genie and says\n\n\"I wish for all the accessories, and leather vests, and helmets, and saddle bags.  I need all of them to be rabbit sized, and I need holes in the helmet for my ears, and a sidecar, so I can take my friends on rides too.\"\n\nGenie smiles and in a cloud of smoke rabbit and his Harley disappear in a flash, and a cloud of smoke.  When they reappear Rabbit is decked out, and his bike has enough chrome to make SAMCRO jealous.  Rabbit starts up the bike, and starts riding circles around the clearing.   \n\nBear, who is on his \"Lady Friend\" nearing completion, screams out over the noise of the Harley and smoke\n\n\"I wish every other bear in the world was a hot lady bear, who wanted my sweaty bear balls.\"\n\nGenie and Rabbit stare at each other, wondering who will speak first after standing witness to the destruction of a species.  All bears in the world are essentially dead, and only they know it.  \n\nRabbit laughs, and rides across the clearing, screaming as he goes...\n\n\"I WISH THAT BEAR WAS GAAAYYYYYYYYYYYyyyyyyyy........\"",

        "body": "About 35 years ago there was a single man taking a drive down a seeming empty country side. His car began to stall a bit as he turned down the green, mountainous land. When it finally died it just so happened to roll in front of a little monastery.\n\nA monk came out and asked if he needed help. There was no reception anywhere and the nearest station was at least 75 miles so he obliged. The monks took him on and said they could fix his car at no charge but it would take the night. The man was having a midlife crisis so he did not even have a plan for where he was heading. He had quit his job and was just traveling anywhere.\n\nAfter he barely dozed off to thoughts about what was next in life for him he heard this strange, mesmerizing sound. It started light, but grew to a louder hum that seemed to penetrate his soul. He could feel power coming from the sound and pure beauty. It kept him up all night. The next morning the monks told him his car was fixed and asked if he needed anything else.\n\n\"I would like to know what was that sound?\" The man asked.\n\n\"Sorry I can't tell you because you're not a monk.\" The head monk replied.\n\nThe man shrugged it on and moved on with his life. He ended up getting a small apartment and a boring office job. He never forgot the sound but it gradually became a very faded memory until one fateful day.\n\nThe man got a job offer at a bigger firm back across the country and he packed up his car to head back. He was going to be making almost triple what he was and have more perks. he decided to drive the same scenic route from 5 years ago and revisit the colorful countryside.\n\nAs his car moved him down the pavement he suddenly heard a familiar sound. The engine echoed a call familiar to five years ago and began to stutter. Fate must have returned him because it broke down in front of the same monastery.\n\nAs he lay awake at night, this time not sleeping at all, he let the same strange sound soak into his being. It consumed him, he could not escape it and he knew it brought him back.\n\nThe next morning he begged to be told or shown the source of the sound, but was met with the same friction.\n\n\"I can't tell you because you are not a monk.\"\n\nHe pleaded, \"obviously you weren't always monks if some of you can fix cars like this foreign one. Please tell me how can I become a monk.\"\n\nThe monk could feel the triangular connection between this man, the universe and himself. He decided he was worthy and told him to become one with nature. \n\nThe monk gave him to simple tasks for anyone destined to be a one of them, \"Travel all the world and become one with yourself and the earth. When you have traveled the world and can tell me the exact number of grains of sand and blades of grass you will be a monk.\"\n\nThe man set out on his journey, forgoing the new job. It took him 30 years but he traveled all of the world and finally understood the answers. He was able to see the numbers because he became on with the world itself. To him it was now like counting fingers. It was simple.\n\nHe returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, I have traveled the earth and devoted my life to the task demanded and have found what you had asked for.. There are 371,145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.\n\nThe monk congratulates him and says, \"You are now one of us. You are ready for the secret to the sound, the secret of the monk, the secret of the universe.\"\n\nThat night they headed down to a basement where the sound was getting louder and louder with each step. The power was radiating through the man and around him already as he stepped to the wooden door.\n\n\"What you seek is behind the door.\" The monk stated.\n\nThe man pulled at the wooden door but it was locked so he asked the monk for a key. The monk already had it in his hand and gave it to him. Behind that door is a door made of stone. The man asked for the key to this one as it was locked as well.\n\n\"use your palm, you already know the technique.\" The man was hesitant but as he had become one with the world he believed and places his palm on the door. The rich sound was vibrating the door to his touch and opened for him. \n\nThis continues on through a ruby door, a sapphire door and even more...emerald, silver, topaz, amethyst. \n\nUntil finally they reach a door made of diamond. It is suddenly quiet as they stand before the door. The man places his palm on it and nothing happens. The monk tells him to believe and it will open.\n\nAs the man closes his eyes and breath deep, remembering the past 30 years something begins to happen. The sound returns, humming low at first. It is as if the sound is intertwined into the gleaming beams of light reflecting off the diamond door.\n\nThe sound now surround him, it floods out as the doors burst open. He open his eyes and is astonished. Here is the most astonishing, beautiful thing in all of the universe. Tears form in his eyes but are swept away in the radiance of the light and sound. He can't believe what he just saw.\n\n I just can't tell you what it was because you're not a monk.\n\n",

We can't have democracy there, otherwise their people will get that oil - and we cannot let their people own it.\n\nTrump: Then, let us invade Iran.\n\nPentagon: We cannot do that either, sir.\n\nTrump: Why not?\n\nCIA: We are talking to them, sir.\n\nTrump: What? Why?\n\nCIA: We want our stealth drone back. If we attack them, Russia will obliterate us as they did to our buddy ISIS in Syria. Besides we need Iran to keep Israel in check.\n\nTrump: Then let us invade Iraq again.\n\nCIA: Sir, our friends (ISIS) are already occupying 1/3rd of Iraq.\n\nTrump: Why not the whole of Iraq?\n\nCIA: We need the Shi'ite gov't of Iraq to keep ISIS in check.\n\nTrump: I am banning Muslims from entering US.\n\nFBI: We can't do that.\n\nTrump: Why not?\n\nFBI: Then our own population will become fearless.\n\nTrump: I am deporting all illegal immigrants to south of the border.\n\nBorder patrol: You can't do that, sir.\n\nTrump: Why not?\n\nBorder patrol: If they're gone, who will build the wall?\n\nTrump: I am banning H1Bs.\nUSCIS: You cannot do that.\n\nTrump: Why?\n\nChief of staff: If you do so we'll have to outsource White House operations to Bangalore.

I cleaned it up a bit:\n\nA biologist, a physicist, a mathematician, and an engineer can't take it anymore and decide to commit suicide. \n\nThe biologist reviews some data and determines the impact velocity required to kill a human. He then  calculates the appropriate drop height using basic conservation of energy, and finds a suitable building.  The biologist jumps off, but the wind resistance slows him down just enough that he survives with major crippling injuries. \n\nThe physicist, hearing of this, develops a more complex model. He models himself as a uniform cone and uses a second order drag model to account for wind resistance. He obtains a numerical solution for the appropriate drop height, which is a little bit higher than what the biologist had anticipated. He finds a suitable building, and jumps off. On the way down, a strong gust blows him into a tree, and then he bounces to the ground. He survives with major crippling injuries. \n\nThe mathematician hears of this and is determined to do it right. He models himself as a non-uniform complex 3D body, and sets up a full-on coupled analysis using the Navier-Stokes equations. To determine the required impact velocity, he uses nonlinear FEA software to model skeletal impact. He then reviews 50 years of local wind statistics and surveys the surrounding area to determine any possible gusts and their respective  probabilities. He analyzes an array of scenarios using a supercomputer running the best CFD software, and determines a 99% confidence interval for the required drop height. He picks the highest number and applies an additional 10% margin of safety. Finally, the mathematician finds a suitable building and jumps off. Higher than average ambient temperatures cause a nearby snow pile to collapse and slide right into the impact zone. The snow cushions his fall just enough that he survives with major crippling injuries. \n\nThe engineer shot himself in the face.",

When he got to his parent's bedroom, he looked through the keyhole to check if his parents were asleep.  Through the keyhole he saw his mom loudly snoring, but his dad wasn't there.  So he went to the maid's room.  When he looked through the maid's room keyhole, he saw his dad having sex with his maid.  Little Johnny was surprised, but then he just realized something and thinks aloud,  \"OH!! Now I understand the government!

For rubbing my lamp, you get two....I mean three wishes!  What is your first wish?\"  \"Hmm\" the man thought. \"I wish I was in a relationship with a girl who is a 10 on the hot scale and a 4 on the crazy scale!\" *poof* a goddess-like girl appeared, jumping on top of him, wanting him to do whatever he wanted to her. \"What do you want next?\" Asked the genie. \"I wish this girl will always love me, no matter what, and that she'll let me do what I want, when I want!\"! \"Done\" says the genie. \"And for your final wish?\"  The man thought long and hard, while his new girlfriend was kissing his neck and face. \"I've got it!  I wish for three more wishes!\"  The genie responds with \"well shucks my friend!  That ain't allowed!  Anything else?\"  The man says \"then I wish to live forever With this girl!\"  All of the sudden *poof* they both turn into volcanoes. The man, now a volcano, yells \"what the fuck have you done!  We're volcanos!\"  \"Well\", says the genie \"volcanos live forever, and isn't that what you asked for?  To live forever with her\". The man, very frustrated, realized there is nothing he can do, and dealt with it. 65 years go, and the man is getting frustrated with his girlfriend, and did not love her anymore. She was obsessed with him, and wouldn't stop telling him how she loves him and wants to have passionate fiery volcano sex with him.  He was just tired of it, and decided he would kill himself by erupting. He finally did it, escaping this girl, and while he was erupting, having a slow and painful death, his girlfriend yelled out to him \"Wait!  I lava you!\"",

        "body": "...and before I get into it, you should know this isn't a joke. I've come here because this is the only place where anyone will listen to me. So, here's my dilemma: I'm standing on a bridge, above some railroad tracks, and tied to the tracks, just behind me, is my own mother! This wouldn't be too out of the ordinary for her, as she often gets overly dramatic and feigns suicide, but she always checks to make sure the tracks are out of service first. This time, I see a train coming down the tracks! Now, next to me on the bridge is long lever, which allows me to vastly increase the force I can apply to a large object, and in this case the large object is a mechanism that moves the train to a different set of tracks. I can pull this lever, and save my mother, but I feel like you should know some things about her, first. She used to beat me. Well, she beat me once, but it was really bad. It wasn't for no reason. Admittedly, I was up to a little trouble. You see, I wanted an allowance, but my parents never gave me one, even though I offered to do all sorts of chores, even untie mom from the train tracks every time she got dramatic. But still, no allowance. So, I had to turn to some more dubious extra-curricular activities if I was going to have any money. I know what you're thinking, but selling drugs was far too risky for me. I found a much more reliable way to get some fast cash. First, I split my soul in two and made a Horcrux (yes, I murdered...we'll get to that), then, I sold that piece of my soul to Mammon, who gave me the power to instantly know a persons net-worth just from looking at them, along with ten billion dollars. Then I realized that Mammon paid me for a whole soul; that sucker didn't even know what half a soul looked like! So, I went ahead and made eight more Horcruxes, because fuck Voldemort, that's why, and I sold them all to different demons at full price. I even got Beelzebub to grant me the power to look homeless at will. I didn't think it would be particularly useful at the time, but it came in handy. People don't look at the homeless. Anyway, I was flying pretty high on my Horcrux money, until it all disappeared from my account. Apparently demon money does that. That happened around  the same time that my mom noticed the ants, and this is where I should mention my murders. I wasn't actually going to kill people, I had some moral compass back then, but I decided that I could kill ants. Surely they don't matter. But that's the problem. For the soul to split, you have to really feel the brutal act of murder in a way that killing an ant just doesn't illicit. So, I began keeping ant-farms in my room, studying their movements, learning their social structures. I became intimately familiar with every part of ant life. I really knew what it was like to be an ant, a cog in a machine so much bigger than one's self, to live for the colony and keep no identity. And once I had achieved oneness with my ant friends, I killed them. I killed them all. Well, 11 of them. The first two were practice. Once I no longer needed to murder, I just kept the rest of the ants in my room. They were still cool to look at, but I got lazy taking care of them and they started getting out. That's when my mom went in my room and found all of the ant-farms on top of dark-arts books and deposit slips from the Great Bank of Satan. Busted. That's when she beat me. But, you have to understand, this wasn't a normal beating with a belt or something. She used a crucifix and kept shouting \"GET OUT OF HIM, GHOST!\" I had no idea what Himghost was or how I got in it, but I guess it just means trouble. So, yeah, after that I left home, penniless because my demon money vanished, and with no place to live. Luckily, I was able to look the part thanks to Beelzebub, and Mammon's trick helped me pick out which people to ask for money. It turns out, I could use it for net-worth, or just how much cash was in your pocket. I used to freak people out by saying \"Come one, I know you have twenty-one dollars and thirty-two cents! You can spare one of those fives.\" That almost always worked, and I actually made a pretty decent living for myself that way. Which brings us to today, with me, standing on the bridge with the lever that will save my mom if I pull it. So I pulled it. My mom and I have a complicated history, but I'll always help her out in a pinch. What's really been bugging me is: should I have really felt that bad about killing those ants?",

'I'm sorry' she exclaims, 'I'm running a bit late. Please come in and I'll introduce you to my parents who will entertain you while I finish dressing. \n    \nI should warn you though, they are both deaf mutes.\"\n\nWith this, she ushers him into the living room, introduces him to her parents and \npromptly disappears. \n\nAs you can imagine, this is a little uncomfortable as both of the parents are completely silent.\n\nDad is sitting in his armchair watching football on TV and Mum is busy knitting. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes of complete silence, Mum jumps from her chair, pulls up her skirt, pulls down her knickers and pours a glass of water over her backside.\n\nJust as sudden, Dad launches himself across the room, bends her over the couch and takes her from behind. \n\nHe then sits back in his chair and balances a match stick in front of his eye. \n\nThe room is plunged back into eerie silence and the young man is shocked into disbelief. \n\n After a further ten minutes, the daughter returns fully dressed and ready for the evening. \n\nThe date is a complete disaster.\n\nThe young man is totally pre-occupied by the antics of the young lady's Parents. \n\nAt the end of the date, sensing something is seriously wrong, the young lady asks the young guy, \n\n\"What's the matter? What have I done wrong?\" \n\n\"No, it's not you\", he replied, \"It's just that the strangest thing happened whilst I was waiting for you and I'm still shocked. Well, first your Mother jumps from her chair, lifts up her skirt, pulls down her panties and throws a glass of water on her  backside.Then, as if that wasn't enough, your father races from his chair, leans her over the couch and does her from behind. He then sits back and places a match stick by his eye\". \n\n\"Oh, is that all?\" replies the girl.\n\nThe man can't believe her casual response. \n\nMum was simply saying 'Are you going to get this asshole a drink?'    \n\nAnd Dad was replying 'No fuck him, I'm watching the match'",

Then I let it flow in me. I tried to feel it. The best way I could put it was food.\n\nLike is sorta similar to pasta or fish & chips for me. I like them. I enjoy them and I don't mind them showing up on my plate. Sometimes, I even crave them but I don't LOVEEE them. I just enjoy them and wanna eat them once in a while. That's it.\n\nLove is kinda like pizza. If I can, I'd eat them everyday. I might get bored of it for a while, maybe curious to try other food. But I'll always come back to it. If I land my dream job, I'd order a pizza to celebrate it. If I lose my pet cat, I'd get myself a slice of pizza. After a long day at work, I'd get myself a piece of pizza as treat. It's the food I'd want to spend my best and worst days with. I'd mourn for the closure of a pizza joint, because I care about pizzas.....because I'm in love with pizza.\n\nBut then again, I can eat pizzas legally. I can't say the same for humans.

Sally quickly picked it up and, not sure what to do with it, they took it home. There, she counted the money - fifty thousand dollars! \nJerry said, We've got to give it back.\nSally said, \"Finders keepers.\" She put the money back in the bag and hid it in their attic.\nThe next day, two police officers were canvassing the neighborhood looking for the money, and knocked on their door. Pardon me, did either of you find a bag that fell out of an armored car yesterday?\nSally said, \"No.\"\nJerry said, \"She's lying. She hid it up in the attic.\"\nSally said, \"Don't believe him, he's getting senile.\"\nThe agents turned to Jerry and began to question him.   \nOne said, \"Tell us the story from the beginning.\"\nJerry said, \"Well, when Sally and I were walking home from school yesterday...\"\nThe first police officer turned to his partner and said, \"We\u2019re outta here!\"\n",

This suite is that posh that it has 2 double bedrooms joined by a connecting door. After relaxing a while they head down to the bar where Paddy orders the most expensive bottle of finest Scots Whisky, Mick goes for the a vintage bottle of Champagne which they polish off before dinner. In the dinning room Mick orders whatever is most expensive on the menu, Paddy orders everything on the menu. 2 hours later they are drunk, stuffed and well satisfied.\n\n\"Ay, Paddy this is life. I can't remember a day so good in all my 340 years\", said Mick.\n\"True enough Mick. It's been a fair day, so it has. What'll we do now....hit a club or the West end?\"\n\"Well, Flower, I'm feeling a bit randy so I am, and with all this money we could hire the best lookin' girls in London town for a night of pleasure we'll remember til we die\". \n\nWithin an hour 2 of the most expensive high class and expertly trained hookers in London arrive at the reception desk, and are quickly led up to Paddy and Mick's Suit. The Lad's are stunned as the girls are more beautiful than they could have ever imagined. Taking the Russian blonde Paddy casts a wink to his mate Mick, knocks back the last of his 3rd bottle of Whisky and heads for the bed room. The dark eyed Spanish beauty stands up and leads Mick over to the bed and begins to undress...Mick just can't believe his luck.\nHalf an hour later, despite the best efforts of Isabella, poor Mick has to throw in the towel. \"Too much drink love\", he says sadly, and rolls over to go to sleep. As he drifts off the last thing he hears is Paddy in the next room shouting: \"One, two, three HUUGGHHH; one, two, three HUUGHHH; one, two, three HUUGGHHHH!!!!\" Blooody hell, thinks Mick....Paddy having a wild time in there!.\n\nThe next morning the girls are gone and Paddy and Mick are sitting over a sumptuous breakfast:\n\"How'd you get on Mick...was that Isabella up to much. Did she earn her money?\", Paddy Laughs. Mick thought about lying, but what'd be the point? After all Paddy was his best mate.\n\"Bit of a disaster, so it was, Paddy. The drink got to me and the wee man couldn't get up. She did everything but I just couldn't manage to get him working. It's a shame is what it is.\"....\nAt this Paddy bust out laughing: \"Couldn't get it up, you say, hey Mick? I couldn't even get on the fucking bed!!\"\n\n\n ",

It made me realize how unattractive I am. I've never even been kissed.\"\n\nThe young man took a moment to take in the young woman appearance. She was, in fact, very attractive herself, despite missing all of her appendages. He gently brushed her hair off to one side and they shared a vibrantly passionate kiss.\n\nShe blushed heavily, thanked him, and their friendly conversation turned philosophical and deep.\nAs the sun began to crest over the lake and the atmosphere surrendered to romance, the woman began to cry again.\n\n\"What could it be this time?\", asked the young man. \"We have had such a nice evening so far.\"\n\n\"It's just...\", the woman moaned, \"I've never had this much of a connection with anyone and its bound to end soon now that nightfall is coming. It makes me realize that I've never been fucked. I can't even do it myself.\"\n\nThe young man puller her head close to his chest to ease her troubled mind.

But what caught my eye most of all is what he had in his hands: the big guns, both of them pointing right at me.\n\nPancho Villa called out to me. \"Se\u00f1or!\" he called out. \"Come down from your horse!\"\n\nI looked him in the eye and replied, \"I come down from my horse for no man.\"\n\nBut what could I do? What could I say? When he had the big guns. So I came down from my horse.\n\nThen Pancho Villa said to me: \"Now, se\u00f1or, drop the pantalones.\" \n\nI said to him, \"I drop the pantalones for no man.\"\n\nBut what could I do? What could I say? He had the big guns. So I dropped the pantalones.\n\nThen Pancho Villa say to me, \"Now, se\u00f1or, you make a poop.\"\n\nI say, \"I make a poop for no man.\" But what could I do? What could I say? He had the big guns. So I made a poop like Pancho Villa said.\n\nThen Pancho Villa said to me, \"Now, se\u00f1or, you will eat your poop.\" I answered, \"I eat my poop for no man.\" But what could I do? What could I say? He had the big guns. So I began to eat my poop.\n\nThen Pancho Villa let out a very big laugh. He let out a laugh so big and so loud that he frightened his horse. The horse reared up on two legs and Pancho Villa dropped the big guns. I ran to grab them, and suddenly I was the one who had the big guns.\n\nFor a long moment, Pancho Villa and I stared at one another, saying not a word.\n\nThen I called out to Pancho Villa. \"Pancho Villa!\" I called out. \"You come down from your horse!\"\n\nPancho Villa gave me a stare that was colder than the snows of Orizaba. In a voice that was slow but determined, he snarled, \"I come down from my horse for no man.\"\n\nBut what could he do? What could he say? I had the big guns. So Pancho Villa came down from his horse.\n\nThen I said to him, \"Pancho Villa, drop the pantalones.\"\n\nHe gave me a menacing look and said, \"I drop the pantalones for no man.\" But what could he do? What could he say? when I had the big guns. So he dropped his pantalones.\n\nThen I said to Pancho Villa, \"Pancho Villa, now make a poop.\" He said, \"I make a poop for no man.\" But what could he do? What could he say? I had the big guns. So Pancho Villa squatted down to make a poop.\n\n\"Now, Pancho Villa,\" I said to him, \"You eat your poop.\" He replied, \"I eat my poop for no man.\" But what could he do? What could he say? I had the big guns. So Pancho Villa ate his poop.\n\nSo, my friend. You ask me, have I met Pancho Villa? Yes, one time we had lunch together.",

        "body": "All in all, it hadn't been a good day. Bad traffic, a malfunctioning computer, incompetent coworkers and a sore back all made me a seething cauldron of rage. But more importantly for this story, it had been over forty-eight hours since I'd last taken a dump. I'd tried to jumpstart the process, beginning my day with a bowl of bowel-cleansing fiber cereal, following it with six cups of coffee at work, and adding a bean-laden lunch at Taco Bell. As I was returning home from work, my insides let me know with subtle rumbles and the emission of the occasional tiny fart that Big Things would be happening soon. Alas, I had to stop at the mall to pick up an order. I completed this task, and as I was walking past the stores on my way back to the car, I noticed a large sale sign proclaiming, \"Everything Must Go!\" This was prophetic, for my colon informed me with a sudden violent cramp and a wet, squeaky fart that everything was indeed about to go. I hurried to the mall bathroom. I surveyed the five stalls, which I have numbered 0 through 4 (I write a lot of software) for your convenience: \n\n0.Occupied \n\n1.Clean, but Bathroom Protocol forbids its use, as it's next to the occupied one. \n\n2.Poo on seat. \n\n3.Poo and toilet paper in bowl, unidentifiable liquid splattered on seat. \n\n4.No toilet paper, no stall door, unidentifiable sticky object near base of toilet. \n\nClearly, it had to be Stall #1. I trudged back, entered, dropped trou and sat down. I'm normally a fairly Shameful Shitter. I wasn't happy about being next to the occupied stall, but Big Things were afoot. \n\nI was just getting ready to bear down when all of a sudden the sweet sounds of Beethoven came from next door, followed by a fumbling, and then the sound of a voice answering the ringing phone. As usual for a cell phone conversation, the voice was exactly 8 dB louder than it needed to be. Out of Shameful habit, my sphincter slammed shut. The inane conversation went on and on. Mr. Shitter was blathering to Mrs. Shitter about the shitty day he had. I sat there, cramping and miserable, waiting for him to finish. As the loud conversation dragged on, I became angrier and angrier, thinking that I, too, had a crappy day, but I was too polite to yak about in public. My bowels let me know in no uncertain terms that if I didn't get crapping soon, my day would be getting even crappier. \n\n\nFinally my anger reached a point that overcame Shamefulness. I no longer cared. I gripped the toilet paper holder in one hand, braced my other hand against the side of the stall, and pushed with all my might. I was rewarded with a fart of colossal magnitude -- a cross between the sound of someone ripping a very wet bed sheet in half and of plywood being torn off a wall. The sound gradually transitioned into a heavily modulated low-RPM tone, not unlike someone firing up a Harley. I managed to hit resonance frequency of the stall, and it shook gently. \n\n- \n\nOnce my ass cheeks stopped flapping in the breeze, three things became apparent: (1) The next-door conversation had ceased; (2) my colon's continued seizing indicated that there was more to come; and (3) the bathroom was now beset by a horrible, eldritch stench. \n\nIt was as if a gateway to Hell had been opened. The foul miasma quickly made its way under the stall and began choking my poop-mate. This initial \"herald\" fart had ended his conversation in mid-sentence. \n\n\"Oh my God,\" I heard him utter, following it with the suppressed sounds of choking, and then, \"No, baby, that wasn't me (cough, gag), you could hear that (gag)??\" \n\nNext door I could hear fumbling with the paper dispenser as he desperately tried to finish his task. Little snatches of conversation made themselves heard over my anal symphony: \"Gotta go... horrible... throw up... in my mouth.... not... make it... tell the kids... love them... oh God...\" followed by more sounds of suppressed gagging and retching. \n\n- \n\nAlas, it is evidently difficulty to hold one's phone and wipe one's bum at the same time. Just as my high-pressure abuse of the toilet was winding down, I heard a plop and splash from next door, followed by a string of swear words and gags. My poop-mate had dropped his phone into the toilet. \n\nAfter a considerable amount of paperwork, I got up and surveyed the damage. I felt bad for the janitor who'd be forced to deal with this, but I knew that flushing was not an option. No toilet in the world could handle that unholy mess. Flushing would only lead to a floor flooded with filth. \n\nAs I left, I glanced to the next-door stall. Nothing remained in the bowl. Had he flushed his phone, or had he plucked it out and left the bathroom with nasty unwashed hands? The world will never know. \n\nI exited the bathroom, momentarily proud and Shameless, looking around for a face glaring at me. But I saw no one. I suspect that somehow my supernatural elimination has manged to transfer my Shamefulness to my anonymous poop-mate. I think it'll be a long time before he can bring himself to poop in public -- and I doubt he'll ever again answer his cell phone in the loo. And this, my friends, is why you should never talk on your phone in the bathroom.\n",

Since Sister Mary Ann was on the way to see a patient, she decided not to wait and walked back to her car. She looked for something in her car that she could fill with gas and spotted the bedpan she was taking to the patient. Always resourceful, Sister Mary Ann carried the bedpan to the station, filled it with gasoline, and carried the full bedpan back to her car. \n\nAs she was pouring the gas into her tank, two Baptists watched from across the street.

Drinks for the ten men would now cost just \u00a380.\n\nThe group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes.\n\nSo the first four men were unaffected.\n\nThey would still drink for free. But what about the other six men?\nThe paying customers?\n\nHow could they divide the \u00a320 windfall so that everyone would get his fair share?\n\nThey realised that \u00a320 divided by six is \u00a33.33. But if they\nsubtracted that from everybody's share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer.\n\nSo, the bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by a higher percentage the poorer he was, to follow the principle of the tax system they had been using, and he proceeded to work out the amounts he suggested that each should now pay.\n\nAnd so the fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% saving).\n\nThe sixth now paid \u00a32 instead of \u00a33 (33% saving).\n\nThe seventh now paid \u00a35 instead of \u00a37 (28% saving).\nThe eighth now paid \u00a39 instead of \u00a312 (25% saving).\n\nThe ninth now paid \u00a314 instead of \u00a318 (22% saving).\n\nThe tenth now paid \u00a349 instead of \u00a359 (16% saving).\n\nEach of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to drink for free. But, once outside the bar, the men began to compare their savings.\n\n\"I only got a pound out of the \u00a320 saving,\" declared the sixth man.\n\nHe pointed to the tenth man,\"but he got \u00a310!\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's right,\" exclaimed the fifth man. \"I only saved a pound too. It's unfair that he got ten times more benefit than me!\"\n\n\"That's true!\" shouted the seventh man. \"Why should he get \u00a310 back, when I got only \u00a32? The wealthy get all the breaks!\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" yelled the first four men in unison, \"we didn't get anything at all. This new tax system exploits the poor!\"\n\nThe nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.\n\nThe next night the tenth man didn't show up for drinks, so the nine sat down and had their beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They didn't have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill!\n\nAnd that, boys and girls, journalists and government ministers, is how our tax system works.\n\nThe people who already pay the highest taxes will naturally get the most benefit from a tax reduction.\n\nTax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up anymore.\n\nIn fact, they might start drinking overseas, where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.\n",

        "body": "There was once a priest who went to see the world after taking his oath. After many years of wandering, he finally arrived in a small village in the middle of nowhere. The people there believed in the same religion as he did, but they had no church; they had to go to the nearest one which was in a small town 25 km's from there. The priest took the initiative, asked the Church for support, and with the help of the local men they built their own temple. From there on, he was celebrating the Sunday masses, joining together men and women in Holy Matrimony, and saying prayers at the funerals.\n\nMany years passed by like that.\n\nAt the end of an ordinary mass, in early spring, on a chilly Sunday morning he was just guiding the people out of the church, was about to close the gates when an unknown man stepped into the churchyard.\n\nWith his dirty and torn clothes, he stood before the priest and said:\n\n\\- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was a good man, and even though he thought the request was a bit strange, he went back to the rectory, took out a lemon, cut it in half, took it back to the man and gave it to him, who looked back to the priest with gratitude. However, the priest was curious. He asked:\n\n\\- Son, why do you need this half of a lemon? - with a fright on his face, and before the priest could have said a thing, he rushed out of the churchyard gate and took off.\n\nA week later, around the same time, when the priest was leaving the church, he found himself in front of the same man in the churchyard. The man said:\n\n\\- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was surprised by the appearance of the man and his strange request. Of course he was good, went back to the rectory, and brought the half lemon. Placed it in the stranger's hand and immediately he asked:\n\n\\- Here it is, my dear son, but please tell me why do you need this half a lemon? - the man was obviously frightened and immediately ran away but the priest was not sluggish either and ran after him. He wasn't in a very good condition, he has never run so much and so fast before so he was out of breath by the end of the village, almost fainted. He thought the strange man might appear again next week, and it would be nice if he could keep up with him, so he spent his week working on his cardio. It turned out to be a good idea, because as he thought, the stranger entered the churchyard on Sunday. The priest didn't even wait for the request, he was good, and brought the half lemon. He received these words from the man:\n\n\\- Thank you priest for being so good and giving me half a lemon.\n\n\\- Don't mention it son, -said the priest- but please tell me, what do you need it for?! - by the time he finished his sentence the man was already running, but the priest was close behind. They were running for a while and the priest was starting to feel exhausted when they arrived at a wide and swift river. The stranger without thinking threw himself into the river and swam across the river and disappeared on the other side. The priest didn't follow because he couldn't swim. He was annoyed when he got home. He spent the next week learning to swim at the swimming pool in the small town 25 km's away. He was anxiously waiting for the next Sunday; now he was sure that the weird fellow would visit again. On Sunday, as he was closing the church, the gate creaked, and entered the man:\n\n\\- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was good, went back, put on his swimming trunks, his running shoes, grabbed half of the lemon and took it to the stranger:\n\n\\- Here it is, my son, but please tell me already, why do you need it? - the guy was terrified, rushed out the gate with the priest following. Reached the river, swam across, the priest right behind him. He kept running on the other side of the river and the priest was still on his tail. They kept running until they got to a tall tree on the verge of a deep ravine. The man climbed the tree with the agility of a cat, the priest not knowing how to climb a tree, stood on the ground. He was cursing everything as he walked back home. The following week the villagers watched as the priest in the garden of the church climbs trees, jumping back and forth, and generally behaving very strangely. The priest didn't care, he was exercising obsessively, preparing himself for the meeting. On Sunday before the mass, he put on his trunks and running shoes under his cassock. In fact, he was good and put half a lemon in his pocket in advance. The mass finished much earlier than usually, and he emptied the church as soon as possible so he could warm up. In the same exact time the mass should have ended, the strange man entered the churchyard.\n\n\\- Priest, please be good... - the priest was already handing him half of a lemon, and asked:\n\n\\- Son, why do you need it for God's sake? - the man ran away terrified, the priest followed him. They ran to the river, swam across, ran to the tree, climbed up. The priest almost catched the stranger when he grabbed a vine and swung to the other side of the ravine. The priest was about to have a stroke, but then he saw another vine. Whoop, he grabbed it and swung across. There, however, he encountered an unexpected obstacle: it was a plane graveyard and the man closed himself in one of the wreckages. The priest was raging as he walked around the wreckage several times, but he found no entrance except for the sealed door on the side of the plane; he had to open it somehow. He was furious but he went home. He spent every day at the village's locksmith and learned every possible way of opening a lock. On Sunday he held the mass in his swimming trunks, running shoes, on his back in a waterproof backpack was a crowbar, a cutting torch, a wrench and a drill, then he stood in front of the church and waited for the man. He was there on time.\n\n\\- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon!\n\n\\- There you go, son - handing him the lemon, because he was good, but in the same time he grabbed the stranger's arm, pulled him close, and with obsession in his eyes, asked:\n\n\\- But what do you need it for?! - panic came over the man as he made his escape from the priest's hands and ran away, but the priest was very close behind. Racing to the river they quickly got across, running up the tree almost breaking their necks, one after the other swung across the ravine, the man barely managed to close the door of the wreckege in the priest's face. Little did he know that the priest would not stop there, because he grabbed his backpack and started working on the lock with his tools. In less than an hour the heavy door creaked open. Inside, the stranger was shivering in horror, he was afraid of the priest's fierce and triumphant look. The priest slowly strode up to the man, crouched down, and very quietly, with a friendly smile on his face, gently asked:\n\n\\- Son. You have been asking for half a lemon for the last few weeks. I'm very happy to give it to you, even in the future, I am only asking in return that you tell me: why do you need it?\n\n\\- All right, priest ... - came the answer in a trembling tone - I will answer your question, but please, be good, and do not tell anyone.\n\nThe priest was good, and never told anyone.",

You see, these days it's hard for me to jerk myself off with my arthritis, so if you are willing to give me handjobs now and then, I will shower you with all my affection.\"\n\nThe old lady thought for a little and soon agreed. So they found a secluded area in the park, the old man unzipped his pants, and she gave him a handjob.\n\nEvery Wednesday they would meet at the same secluded area in the park and she would give him a handjob. And in return he bought her nice gifts, was affectionate, and made her extremely happy. The relationship suited them both very well.\n\nOne Wednesday, the old lady went back to the park, but the old man was nowhere to be found. She was sad, but figured he had somewhere to be. But the next Wednesday he wasn't there either, and the week after that. She worried that something had happened to him, and she tried but could not get in touch with him. She became sad and depressed at having lost her newfound love.\n\nOne day, she went for a walk in the same park where she used to meet the old man, and as she was walking, she noticed an older couple in a secluded area of the park. As she got closer, she noticed, son of a bitch it was the old man! And some new woman was giving him a handjob! Furious, she ran up to them and confronted the old man.\n\n\"What's going on here?! I thought we had a great thing going!\" she yelled to the old man.\n\n\"Well, we did have something really special, and you were very good to me. But this lady has something that you don't have.\"\n\n\"What? I was perfect for you! What could this woman possibly have that I don't?\" she asked.\n\nAnd he said, \"Parkinson's.\"",

If you water and fertilize this seed, and make sure it has enough light, it will grow into something wonderful!\u201d\n\nThe boy watered and fertilized the seed only once, and to his surprise it sprouted into a bush of herbs.  The boy was astonished that the simple directions of the owner were true; the boy had not put much effort or care into the task, yet the plant grew on its own.\n\nThe winter passed, and in the spring the boy was saddened to see that the herbs had died.  He went to the farm owner to ask why.\n\nThe owner was sipping hot tea.  \u201cAh, annuals,\u201d said the owner, who then went on to explain that the type of seed he gave the boy would sprout only once and then die.  Pleased with the boy\u2019s progress, he gave the boy another very special seed.\n\n\u201cYou must work hard, boy.  If you water and fertilize this seed, and make sure it has enough light, it will grow into something wonderful!\u201d\n\nThe boy watered and fertilized the seed only once, and to his surprise it sprouted into a beautiful flower.  Again the boy was astonished that he simply planted the seed and it grew despite that he had forgotten to care for it.  He smiled to himself in an arrogant fashion, proud that he had developed such a green thumb.\n\nHe waited another year, and the flower bloomed again.  The boy deduced that the seed he was given must have been of a different sort, one that would sprout many times before it would die.  And yet after another year passed, it was clear that this plant had died too.  He went to the farm owner to ask why.\n\nThe owner was sipping hot coffee.  \u201cAh, perennials,\u201d said the owner, who then went on to explain that the type of seed he gave the boy would sprout several times across the years before dying.  Confused with why the plant had died after only two years of life, he gave the boy another very special seed.\n\n\u201cYou must work hard boy.  If you water and fertilize this seed, and make sure it has enough light, it will grow into something wonderful!\u201d\n\nThe boy watered and fertilized the seed only once, and to his surprise it never even sprouted.  \u201cThis was supposed to be easy!\u201d the boy shouted in frustration.  The last two seeds had bloomed without him doing any work at all.  He stormed into the farm owner\u2019s house, demanding to know why the seed had not sprouted.\n\nThe owner was sipping a cocktail.  \u201cAh, millennials,\u201d sighed the owner.\n",

Lorde has a gig in the coolest club in town and the squad decided to go to the club after a short pre-drinking. The pre-drinking took place at Al Bundys home and they had profound discussions. Vegeta to King Joeffrey \"man do you ever fucked a girl in the other hole?\" \"NO of course not!\" responds Joeffrey, \"i don't want to get her pregnant!\" After short pre-drinking they start their journey.\u00a0 \nAll except Al Bundy. Al was a little bit to drunk for partying. He was standing in the bathroom and told the showerhead to stop crying.\nThe others were on their way. All completely drunk. Frodo saw a tree and climb on it \"fellers!! that's the biggest broccoli i've ever seen!!\" The others laughed. BUUUUUUUMMMMMMM!!! a porsche has crashed into the tree. \nThe driver was screaming \"my porsche! my porsche! my porsche!\" Broseidon rushes him to help! \"Hey bro forget your porsche, you've lost your arm!!\" \nThe porsche driver responds \"my rolex!\u00a0 my rolex! my rolex!\"\n\"Don't worry dude I'll take care of it!\" says Joeffrey! Proud he looks at his new watch! Moments later the paramedics arrived and so the journey of the 6 friends and Markus continues. \n\"THIS IS SPARTAAA!!!\" Cristiano Ronaldo shouted. They've reached the coolest club in town! >>>SPARTA<<< It was heavily guarded by 300 doormen. Unfortunately Frodo's worn-out clothes were not classy enough to enter the club. He had to stay outside. Meanwhile\u00a0 Broseidon, Vegeta, San Goku, Cristiano Ronaldo King Joeffrey and Markus went into the club. ---Well, of course, like every other group of friends that enter a club they lost each other a few moments after entering... So everyone has to fight alone to find love--- Lorde was playing on a big stage in the middle of the main floor. Everyone was\npartying.\nBroseidon goes straight to a beautiful Lady. After some smalltalk they kissed each other... everything seems fine, but right before Broseidon wants to ask for her number,\u00a0 another guy shows up. And for some reason the Lady was completely into that other guy. Broseidon had no chance to get the girl. He looses the battle against this mysterious guy who calls himself Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. What a dickhead! he's never seen something like that before! Unbelievable...\nKing Joeffrey walks into an rnb-floor and sees a fat girl dancing on a table. He walks over to her and says, \"Wow, nice legs!\" She is flattered and replies, \"You really think so?\" Joeffrey says, \"Oh definitely! Most tables would have collapsed by\nnow\".\nCristiano Ronaldo had it going on with a hot blonde lady. The whole time she talks about her husband who died cause of a small flesh wound he was getting in a battle against some wannabe-soldier. He killed the wannabe but later the wound had festered and so he died because of a sepsis, and then it gets all crazy with slaves, witchcraft, fire and all that shit. She said now she's fully into her career and stuff but Cristiano didn't listen, he just wanted to bang her. After sone drinks they went to the toilet to do some grown up stuff. Cristiano riped his clothes off.... \"doesn't look my body like dynamite?\" - \"maybe, but with that short fuse it's worthless!\" She said and left Cristiano behind crying in the toilet. At the same time King Joeffrey was beaten up cause he had made fun of Kathleen Jenner and the new principal of the scool in town didn't tolerate such intolerant douchebags. Meanwhile Markus wants to get a date. He wasn't a womenizer but he had heard from his friend Stifler that women like tough guys, so he walks up to a lady at the bar and says: \"eyyy you like tough guys??\" - \nShe: \"hmmm could be\" -\nHe: \"Well i don't use toilet paper...\" - \nShe responds \"Ohhhhh... raaawwrr... you have to show me ;)\" \nJust kidding. She slaped him and ran away. San Goku flirts with a tall girl and he was really into her. He was very politely and also paid her some drinks, then he ask for her number... but the girl responds \"You find it in the phone book.\" - \"but I don't know your name\" San Goku said. The girl just answered \"that's in the pone book to!\" \nPoor San Goku... Vegeta has watched the whole scene from behind...\nSooo back to Broseidon. He's found another cute girl to approach. He get's in touch with her. But suddenly a dude with short pants and a Bowling shirt shows up. This prick told about a beach house in malibu and paaaaff the girl was fallen in love with that strange way to old man. But that was nothing compared to what's next. You should have seen Broseidon's eyes as he flirted with the next girl and suddenly a small ugly guy with a bowl haircut appears. So this dickhead really claimed to be an astronaut. And the worst thing, the chick did believe him!! What a liar! Can you believe that?! \"I bet this bowl haircut dick still lives at his mum's\u00a0 house\" Broseidon thought. Clearly that was to much for him. He decided to get completely drunk!\nAfter his hopeless attempt before, Markus sits alone at a table and drinks a pepsi. At the table next to him there was a beautiful brunette... Markus wondered what he could say... He knows, everytime he is talking to a girl he says something stupid. Suddenly the brunette stands up and walks away. So he thought \"I guess it's better this way, it wouldn't have worked out anyway\" but while he was thinking about how much it wouldn't worked out with her the brunette came back and sit down at the table again. \"THAT'S A SIGN!\" he thought \"WE ARE MEANT FOR EACH OTHER!!\" so he empties his pepsi,\u00a0 streches out his chest and walks up to her like a champion \"heyyyyyy.... you've been pooping?\"\nVegeta had enough... only girls who are way to young and with waaaaayyy to much make up... He get's approached by a lot of girls. One of them, was really persistent. Ironically it was the bitch that had dumped San Goku before. Vegeta remembers her, so he just says \"Words can't describe how beautiful you are...\"\nShe \"awwwwww that's so sweeeeet! :)\"\nV: \"but numbers can. 2/10.\"\nVegeta turns around, and calls a cab. On his way home he was wondering why Lorde had hairy legs... but then he discard the thoughts, cause he had to think about his next biceps workout\ntomorrow.\nFinally Broseidon was kissing a gorgeous blonde wich said she works at the cheesecake factory. What he didn't know: the sexy blonde was on her period. But she just thought \"Ahh he's so sweet and also really drunk, he won't even notice!\"\nThe next morning Broseidon wakes up alone in the bed wondering what had happened the night before... He gets a shock!!! The whole bed was covered in blood! He just remembers the blonde girl from the cheesecake factory but what happened next? What have he done? Immidiately he runs to the gun locker! \"GOOD! All cartridges complete so I haven't shot her!\" he tought. Next he checks the knife block in the kitchen. All knifes there, no knife is bloody \"Oh good i haven't stabed her!\" But then he thinks \"wait a moment... I don't have a gun locker... I haven't even a knife block! Where the fuck am I and what have I done to the girl?\" In panic he runs through the apartment. Suddenly he stop in front of a mirror... thinking \"FUCK!!! I'VE EATEN HER!!!!\"",

After he graduated he was bumming around, sleeping on his friend's couch. He got a job washing cars at a car dealership for beer money. One day he helped convince some customers to buy a car, and on a hunch the dealership owner made him a salesman. He's been so successful that now he owns three dealerships, and he just gave his best friend a Mercedes Benz for his birthday!\"\n\nUpon finishing his story the fourth man returned from the bathroom. They tell him that they'd been talking about their sons and the fourth man says, \"Oh god, I hate to say it but to be honest my son is a little bit of a disappointment.

So let me ask you this: Who is your father's son?\"\n\nJoe thinks about it, and replies, \"That would be me, Mr President.\"\n\nObama nods. \"Excellent, that is correct! See, Mr Trump?\"\n\nTrump hates to admit it, but he is impressed. \"Very good, Mr President,\" he says. \"Thanks for the advice.\"\n\nTrump returns to his office at Trump Towers and decides to test Mr Obama's method. He picks up the phone and rings Chris Christie. \"Hello, Chris?\" \n\n\"Yes Mr Trump?\" says Chris Christie on the other side.\n\n\"I want you to answer a simple question. Who is your father's son?\"\n\nChris is perplexed. After a few moments of silence, he replies, \"I'll get back to you tomorrow, Mr Trump.\" and puts down the phone. Worried about disappointing Trump, he calls the smartest person he knows, Bill Gates. He dials Bill Gates' number. \n\n\"Hello? Bill?\"\n\n\"What is it Chris?\"\n\n\"I need to ask you a question.\"\n\nBill Gates gets annoyed. \"Look, Chris, no more stupid questions, ok? I have a meeting in 15 minutes and I've got to get ready.\"\n\n\"Right, right,\" says Chris in a flurry. \"Who is your father's son?\"\n\nBill is furious. \"IT'S ME OF COURSE YOU FAT PIECE OF SHIT!\" he yells and slams down the phone. \n\nThe next day, Chris meets Donald Trump for lunch. \"So, Chris,\" says Trump. \"You said you'd get back to me on this. Who is your father's son?\"\n\nChris smiles triumphantly. \"Why, Mr Trump, it's Bill Gates, of course!\" Trump is enraged and slaps him in the face.\n\n\"IDIOT!\" he yells. \"IT'S JOE BIDEN, YOU STUPID SHIT!\"\n\n",

Everyone complied to this rule for the quite some time, but one day when Moses consulted the Bush, the Bush told him that one of the Israelites had failed to follow the rule, and unless that Israelite was disciplined or came forward to confess their sin and be shamed in front of the tribe, they would all be slaves of the Pharaoh for eternity. Naturally, this caused some commotion as to who could have violated this rule, and also naturally, all denied having leavened the bread. Everyone had their families as witnesses claiming they did not break the rule. All except for Nina, as she lived alone. Since she was so well respected, no one questioned her at first, but eventually all the evidence began to point in her direction. Rather than asking her directly, and thus humiliating her before the Israelites, Moses asked the Burning Bush if she was the perpetrator. He and his brother Aaron approached the holy ground, and Moses asked aloud \"BUSH, DID NINA LEAVEN?\"",

Joe was put on trial for the negligent homicide of nearly a hundred people. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by the electric chair.\n\nWhen asked what he'd like for his last meal, he replied simply with \"A banana, if you will.\" The prison guard shrugged, got a banana, and gave it to the poor man. Joe ate the banana in regular fashion and braced himself for death. He was seated on the chair, fastened in, and was ready for what was about to happen.\n\nHowever, after the electricity was activated, nothing happened. The guard was astonished. Not knowing what to do, he simply let Joe go.\n\nA few days later, Joe was back to work conducting trains. Shortly after his return, he managed to derail yet another train, again killing nearly a hundred people but surviving the crash. As before, he was charged and found guilty of multiple negligent homicides. Again, he was sentenced to death by electric chair.\n\nIt was the same prison guard as before. He was surprised to see Joe again but held his tongue, for the man was about to die and it would be rude to question him. \"What would you like for your last meal, sir?\" Joe respond as he did last time: \"A banana, if you will.\" The prison guard shrugged, got a banana, and gave it to the poor man. Joe ate the banana in regular fashion and again braced himself for death. He was seated on the chair, fastened in, and was ready for what was about to happen.\n\nThe electricity was activated and Joe was prepared. But, as before, he was unhurt. The prison guard checked for any malfunctions but found nothing, not believing the entire situation was possible. Now even more incredulous than before, and not knowing what to do, the guard let him go.\n\nJoe was, against all odds, alive and was incredibly still allowed to continue his job as a train conductor even though he was responsible for the deaths of almost two hundred people.\n\nHe was thankful to be allowed to continue his job but also scared. He would try to drive more carefully from now on. However, this effort didn't help much, as the very next train he was conducting, he managed to somehow crash. He was the only survivor of the train, which again contained over a hundred people. He was again charged, and again found responsible for the deaths of over a hundred people. He was sentenced to death by electric chair.\n\nThe prison guard was the same, the meal was the same, the procedure was the same. After giving Joe the banana, the guard was silent. He couldn't bring himself to say anything, all he could do was prepare the chair.\n\nJoe sat in the chair, expecting death. The guard activated it and, again, Joe was unscathed. The prison guard couldn't contain himself. He simply had to ask, \"Sir, how did you manage to crash a train 3 times? And how did you survive the chair 3 times? Did the banana have something to do with it?\" \n\nJoe paused for a moment. Then he replied: \"No, I suppose I'm just a terrible conductor.\"",

Jaques De Gatineau, he was accepted to all the best universities and got three degrees. He was going to be the next great.\nThere was Peter Leroux, Wilfred Pasteur, Jerome tsonga, the three wise men of quebec. Jaques De Gatineau was to be the next. But he vanished.\nSo years pass, I started to travel and get around. I traveled from here to there, and to here again. So at one point in my life, I found myself at Sea World. And so I have a guy show me to where the baby dolphins are being feed, cause who doesn't like baby dolphins? And guess who I saw! None other than Jaques De Gatineau! \nSo I walk up to the guy, and I say \"Jaques De Gatineau, I feel ashamed for you. You were our hope. You were to go to Canada's capital of Ottawa. We pinned all of Quebec's hopes onto YOU.\" Now that's a terrible burden, to have a town's hopes pinned on him.\n\u00a0So he's feeding these little baby dolphins. And I say \"I'm ashamed of you Jaques De Gatineau, you could have done so many great things.\" \nAnd he said \"well, I think I'm serving a youthful porpoise.\"",

Heaven is TEEMING with ducks! Try as they might, they quickly realize that avoiding the birds is going to be a difficult task.

The angel rushes over, ties Friend Two to a hideous being, and flies away. \n\nThe third friend, now petrified that this will be his fate, becomes incredibly paranoid, barely walking anywhere.

Surely enough, the next day, he comes with 1k in cash to deposit into his account. The tellers tell the man that the manager would like to see him. The manager, who sits in a giant glass office on the bank floor, welcomes the man and then asks him how he gets $1,000 to put in every day. The man tells him \"well, I make a lot of bets and that's where all the money is from.\" The manager doesn't believe how he can make all that money just by betting, so the man says \"okay then, I bet you $1,000 I can bite my eye.\"\n\n\"bullshit!

You didn't know I had a glass eye. I bet you double that I can bite my ear!\" The manager thinks that it's impossible and is desperate to make his money back. \"Deal.\"\n\nThe man then takes out his dentures and bites his ear. The manager is embarrassed and upset he's lost all that money on a stupid bet. The man notices this and says \"Okay, you seem upset. I'll make it up to you fair and square.

Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away.\n\nMbembe never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.\n\nTwenty years later, Mbembe was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son.\n\nAs they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Mbembe and his son Tapu were standing.\n\nThe large bull elephant stared at Mbembe, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.\n\nRemembering the encounter in 1986, Mbembe couldn't help wondering if this was the same elephant.\n\nMbembe summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Mbembe' s legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly. It wasn't the same elephant.",

Upon hearing that the priest has a few hours off the fisherman invites him out to sea to fish with him.\n\nOut at sea it doesn't take long for the fisherman to realize that the priest has no idea how to fish, so he gives him some quick instruction and shows him how to cast his bait out into the water. Within moments the priest manages to reel in the largest fish that the fisherman has ever seen. In the moment of excitement the fisherman exclaims, \"Look at the size of that Son-of-a-bitch!\"\n\nImmediately the priest becomes disturbed and says, \"My son, please don't use such language.\"\n\nThe fisherman, embarrassed and hoping word of this gaffe will not reach the rest of his family, makes up an explanation in a moment of ingenuity, \"Oh no father, that's the name of that type of fish, a son-of-a-bitch.\" He lies, taking advantage of the priests fishing naivete. \n\nThe priest is pacified, and begs forgiveness for jumping to conclusions. The fisherman, relieved, brings the priest back to the docks and drops him off.\n\nThe priest lumbers back to the church, with the giant fish in his arms. Upon entering the church he sees the bishop and approaches him, \"Bishop, look at the size of this son-of-a-bitch I caught!\"\n\nThe bishop stands wide-eyed a moment, \"Priest, how could a man as holy as you use such language in the house of God?\"\n\nThe priest calmly explains that it is the name of the fish, and the bishop feeling embarrassed for jumping to conclusions offers to take and clean the fish for the priest. \n\nAfter cleaning the fish the bishop takes it to the maid in the kitchen and tells her, \"Maid, I want you to cook this son-of-a-bitch for me.\"\n\nThe maid blushes and responds, \"Bishop, it may not be my place to say so, but is such language fitting for a man of your stature?\"\n\nThe bishop laughs haughtily, explains that it's the name of the fish and that he too had made the same mistake only minutes earlier. The maid laughs too, apologizes and cooks the fish.\n\nIt just so happens that the Pope decided to stop in for dinner at their church that evening. They are all sitting at the table when the pope says, \"Oh, my children, I know that gluttony is a sin but I simply can't stop myself from eating this fish. I must know, where did you get it?\"\n\n\"I caught the son-of-a-bitch.\" Said the priest.\n\n\"I cleaned the son-of-a-bitch.\" Said the bishop.\n\n\"And I cooked the son-of-a-bitch.\" Said the maid.\n\nFor a moment the pope sat silently, staring at them all wide-eyed. He then slowly removed his hat, kicked off his sandles, put his hands behind his head, kicked his feet up on the table and said, \"You know what? You mother fuckers are alright!\"",

I had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with you and Mom.\n\nI've been finding real passion with Joan and she is so nice. I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercings, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes and because she is so much older than I am but it's not only the passion, Dad, she's pregnant.\n\nJoan says that we are going to be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood, enough for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.\n\nJoan has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.\nIn the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so Joan can get better; she sure deserves it!\n\nDon't worry Dad, I'm 15 years old now and I know how to take care of myself. Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your grandchildren.\n\nYour son, Chad\n\nP.S. Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Tommy's house.

They examined the Shan carefully; then they instructed the scribes to write out enormous bills,; then they informed the Shah and the Shahnee that their son, the Shan, heir to the Peacock Throne, was epileptic.\n\n Now in those days there was no Medicare or super-efficient public or private hospital system such as we enjoy in Australia today; there was not much that could be done about his condition. \n\nSo the wise men got together, got their scribes to write out some more enormous bills and recommended to the Shah that he appoint some special bodyguards to take care of the Shan and watch over him all the time.\n\n And it was so. Everywhere the little Shan went, the bodyguard went, too, watching over him and taking care of him.\n\n For a while, all was well, but then, one day, when many months had passed without any untoward incident, the bodyguard grew complacent. The time came when he left the Shan alone while he indulged in amorous dalliance with one of the ladies of the court.\n\n And of course, it was at this time that the young Shan had an epileptic seizure and, being unattended injured himself.\n\n Great was the commotion in the Palace and the Shah waxed wroth. Summoning the bodyguard into his presence he angrily demanded, \"Where were you when the fit hit the Shan?\"  ",

A news reporter recently interviewd surviving veterans, and one told his story. \"We were flying back home, when the plane was shot down out of the sky. There were others that survived the crash but not for long. I heard the enemy approching so I took off runnig for my life. I didnt know where I was for 3 months befor rescue. I didnt have any food and wasnt prepared. But what kept me alive was the briefing that the Senior Officer gave when we had first arrived. I looked under at least 100 trees. Befor I found my first squirl. He ran off after I unfroze him and I didnt think I would see him again. After the first one I knew what to look for though and unfroze about 6-7 more. By the end of the week I was eating like a king, with 16 tiny hands bringing me berries and little sweet shrubs. Now don't get me wrong I never want to do that again, but those furry little angels kept me alive during a harsh German winter.\" Furry little angels he called them, and why not he still lives even at 93, but not everyone was so happy with this information.

And though she's not sure that it's the godly thing to so, she's frankly thrilled when he returns the flirting in kind and by the time they have slurped up the last of the Jello at dinner, they're an item.\n\nA few days later he asks her - since their together - if she would mind if he slept in her room. He promises not to take advantage of the situation. \"I've been alone for many years,\" he says, \"and I just want to be held by someone I care for.\" Well she's not too sure about this, but she decides to give him a chance. \"No funny stuff?\" she asks - and he agrees.\n\nSure enough, they sleep that night in the same bed together and he never makes a move on her. She relaxes. Glad for the company and togetherness. He was right: being alone wasn't nearly as good as holding someone while you slept.\n\nSo they try it again a few days later. And a few days after that. Soon it's every day. Just sleeping together in the same bed, holding each other.\n\nAnd then he misses a day.\n\nAnother.\n\nAnother.\n\nHe hardly comes around or pays attention to her.\n\nShe confronts him, \"Where have you been? I've been so lonely! Be honest with me, is it another woman?\"\n\nHe must be honest. Eyes downcast, he admits that it is.\n\n\"But what does she have that I don't?\"\n\n\"Parkinsons.\"",

She claims that he had a large red rash, he had been complaining of fatigue and joint pain for several weeks, and there had more recently been blood in his urine. After the man's condition is stabilized, House assembles his army of toadies to figure out just what the heck was going on. He writes the symptoms on his whiteboard in his characteristic chicken scratch, and then asks, \"what have we got?\" Dr. Chase, being his eager little beaver self, suggested Sarcoidosis, like he always does. House smacks him firmly with his cane, and insults him for being Australian. \"Maybe you should go shoot some dingos for a living since you can't practice medicine competently\", House scolds. Having been shot down, Chase goes and sits down in his chair, and mulls over the options. Dr. Cameron pipes up next, and since she believes she is that smartest of the three underlings, she has great confidence in her answer, \"I believe it's kidney failure, since there's blood in his urine.\" House gives her a scathing, condescending stare. He snaps at her that even if it were kidney failure, it was *obviously* a symptom, not a cause. He bickers about how she always misses the bigger picture and that she's pissing away her potential. Being reluctant to speak up due to his suggestion, Dr. Foreman figures House will pry it out of him eventually. He decides to just say screw it, and go balls deep. \"Gregory,\" he says, as if his suggestion will shake the foundation of the Earth, \"I think it could be lupus\"",

During a recent cold spell, the wife was bringing a lot of them indoors to protect them from a possible freeze.\n \nIt turned out that a little green garden grass snake was hidden in one of the plants.When it had warmed up, it slithered out and the wife saw it go under the sofa.\n \nShe let out a very loud scream.\n \nThe husband (who was taking a shower) ran out into the living room naked to see what the problem was.She told him there was a snake under the sofa.\n \nHe got down on the floor on his hands and knees to look for it. About that time the family dog came and cold-nosed him on the behind.He thought the snake had bitten him, so he screamed and fell over on the floor.\n \nHis wife thought he had had a heart attack, so she covered him up, told him to lie still and called an ambulance.\n \nThe attendants rushed in, would not listen to his protests, loaded him on the stretcher, and started carrying him out.\n \nAbout that time, the snake came out from under the sofa and the Emergency Medical Technician saw it and dropped his end of the stretcher.That's when the man broke his leg and why he is still in the hospital.\n \nThe wife still had the problem of the snake in the house, so she called on a neighbor who volunteered to capture the snake. He armed himself with a rolled-up newspaper and began poking under the couch.Soon he decided it was gone and told the woman, who sat down on the sofa in relief.\n \nBut while relaxing, her hand dangled in between the cushions, where she felt the snake wriggling around.She screamed and fainted, the snake rushed back under the sofa.\n \nThe neighbor man, seeing her lying there passed out, tried to use CPR to revive her.\n \nThe neighbor's wife, who had just returned from shopping at the grocery store, saw her husband's mouth on the woman's mouth and slammed her husband in the back of the head with a bag of canned goods, knocking him out and cutting his scalp to a point where it needed stitches.\n \nThe noise woke the woman from her dead faint and she saw her neighbor lying on the floor with his wife bending over him, so she assumed that the snake had bitten him. She went to the kitchen and got a small bottle of whiskey, and began pouring it down the man's throat.\n \nBy now, the police had arrived.\n \nBreathe here...\n \nThey saw the unconscious man, smelled the whiskey, and assumed that a drunken fight had occurred.They were about to arrest them all, when the women tried to explain how it all happened over a little garden snake!\n \nThe police called an ambulance, which took away the neighbor and his sobbing wife.\n \nNow, the little snake again crawled out from under the sofa and one of the policemen drew his gun and fired at it.He missed the snake and hit the leg of the end table.The table fell over, the lamp on it shattered and, as the bulb broke, it started a fire in the drapes.\n \nThe other policeman tried to beat out the flames, and fell through the window into the yard on top of the family dog who, startled, jumped out and raced into the street,where an oncoming car swerved to avoid it and smashed into the parked police car.\n \nMeanwhile, neighbors saw the burning drapes and called in the fire department.The firemen had started raising the fire ladder when they were halfway down the street.The rising ladder tore out the overhead wires, put out the power, and disconnected the telephones in a ten-square city block area (but they did get the house fire out).\n \nTime passed. Both men were discharged from the hospital, the house was repaired, the dog came home, the police acquired a new car and all was right with their world.\n \nA while later they were watching TV and the weatherman announced a cold snap for that night.The wife asked her husband if he thought they should bring in their plants for the night.\n \nAnd that's when he shot her.",

He knocked on the door and was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, grey beard. \n\n\"I'm lost,\" said the man. \"Can you put me up for the night?\" \n\n\"Certainly,\" the Chinese man said, \"but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man.\" \n\n\"Ok,\" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. \n\nBefore dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young,beautiful, and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man since she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during he night, he could bear it no longer, and sneaked into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn he crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy. \n\nHe woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, \"Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest.\" \"Well, that's pretty crappy,\" he thought. \"If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about.\" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: \"Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle.\" In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, \"Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost.\"",

        "body": "To the citizens of the United States of America,\n\nIn the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today. Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The Right Honourable Tony Blair, MP for the\u00a097.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed. To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:\n\n\n1. You should look up \"revocation\" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Then look up \"aluminium\". Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. The letter 'U' will be reinstated in words such as 'favour' and 'neighbour', skipping the letter 'U' is nothing more than laziness on your part. Likewise, you will learn to spell 'doughnut' without skipping half the letters. You will end your love affair with the letter 'Z' (pronounced 'zed' not 'zee') and the suffix \"ize\" will be replaced by the suffix \"ise\". You will learn that the suffix 'burgh is pronounced 'burra' e.g. Edinburgh. You are welcome to respell Pittsburgh as 'Pittsberg' if you can't cope with correct pronunciation. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up \"vocabulary\". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as \"like\" and \"you know\" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up \"interspersed\". There will be no more 'bleeps' in the Jerry Springer show. If you're not old enough to cope with bad language then you shouldn't have chat shows. When you learn to develop your vocabulary then you won't have to use bad language as often.\n\n\n2. There is no such thing as \"US English\". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf. The Microsoft spell-checker will be adjusted to take account of the reinstated letter 'u' and the elimination of \"-ize\".\n\n\n3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn't that hard. English accents are not limited to Cockney, upper-class twit or Mancunian (Daphne in Frasier). You will also have to learn how to understand regional accents - Scottish dramas such as \"Taggart\" will no longer be broadcast with subtitles. While we're talking about regions, you must learn that there is no such place as Devonshire in England. The name of the county is \"Devon\". If you persist in calling it Devonshire, all American States will become \"shires\" e.g. Texasshire, Floridashire, Louisianashire.\n\n\n4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys. Hollywood will be required to cast English actors to play English characters. British sit-coms such as \"Men Behaving Badly\" or \"Red Dwarf\" will not be re-cast and watered down for a wishy-washy American audience who can't cope with the humour of occasional political incorrectness.\n\n\n5. You should relearn your original national anthem, \"God Save The Queen\", but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.\n\n\n6. You should stop playing American \"football\". There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American \"football\" is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays \"American\" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American \"football\", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005. You should stop playing baseball. It is not reasonable to host an event called the 'World Series' for a game which is not played outside of America. Since only 2.15% of you are aware that there is a world beyond your borders, your error is understandable. Instead of baseball, you will be allowed to play a girls' game called \"rounders\" which is baseball without fancy team strip, oversized gloves, collector cards or hotdogs.\n\n\n7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The\u00a097.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys. \"Merde\" is French for \"5hit\". You will no longer be allowed to own or carry guns. You will no longer be allowed to own or carry anything more dangerous in public than a vegetable peeler. Because we don't believe you are sensible enough to handle potentially dangerous items, you will require a permit if you wish to carry a vegetable peeler in public.\n\n\n8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called \"Indecisive Day\".\n\n\n9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean. All road intersections will be replaced with roundabouts. You will start driving on the left with immediate effect. At the same time, you will go metric with immediate effect and without the benefit of conversion tables. Roundabouts and metrication will help you understand the British sense of humour.\n\n\n10. You will learn to make real chips. Those things you call French fries are not real chips. Fries aren't even French, they are Belgian though\u00a097.85% of you (including the guy who discovered fries while in Europe) are not aware of a country called Belgium. Those things you insist on calling potato chips are properly called \"crisps\". Real chips are thick cut and fried in animal fat. The traditional accompaniment to chips is beer which should be served warm and flat. Waitresses will be trained to be more aggressive with customers.\n\n\n11. As a sign of penance 5 grams of sea salt per cup will be added to all tea made within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, this quantity to be doubled for tea made within the city of Boston itself.\n\n12. The cold tasteless stuff you insist on calling beer is not actually beer at all, it is lager. From November 1st only proper British Bitter will be referred to as \"beer\", and European brews of known and accepted provenance will be referred to as \"Lager\". The substances formerly known as \"American Beer\" will henceforth be referred to as \"Near-Frozen Knat's Urine\", with the exception of the product of the American Budweiser company whose product will be referred to as \"Weak Near-Frozen Knat's Urine\". This will allow true Budweiser (as manufactured for the last 1000 years in Pilsen, Czech Republic) to be sold without risk of confusion.\n\n13. From November 1st the UK will harmonise petrol (or \"Gasoline\" as you will be permitted to keep calling it until April 1st 2001) prices with the former USA. The UK will harmonise its prices to those of the former USA and the Former USA will, in return, adopt UK petrol prices (roughly $6/US gallon - get used to it).\n\n\n14. You will learn to resolve personal issues without using guns, lawyers or therapists. The fact that you need so many lawyers and therapists shows that you're not adult enough to be independent. Guns should only be handled by adults. If you're not adult enough to sort things out without suing someone or speaking to a therapist then you\u2019re not grown up enough to handle a gun.\n15. Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us crazy.\n\n\nTax collectors from Her Majesty's Government will be with you shortly to ensure the acquisition of all revenues due (backdated to 1776).\nThank you for your cooperation.",

He notices the Mercedes-Benz hood ornament, but doesn't know what it is, because he is only used to Trabbis and soviet cars.\n\nTherefore he asks the driver:\"Excuse me, what is this star thing on the car?\"\nThe driver decides to play a joke on him and answers: \"That's a sight. We use it to aim at pensioners, because you get a lot money for killing them that way. We are saving money this way in the long term.\" The East German nods calmy and thinks about these strange customs.\n\nA few minutes pass, until the cab drivers sees an old man on a bicycle in the distance. He decides to take the joke one step further, aims at the man, accelerates, but in the last second changes the direction and guns past him.\n\nThe East German man remarks: \"That was close!\"\n\"Yes I know!\", the cab driver answers smiling.\nThe East German looks at him and says calmy: \"Well yeah, if I hadn't reacted fast enough and yanked open the passenger door to hit him with it, we wouldn't have gotten the money for sure!\"",

He began to run toward Jesus.\n\n\"Yes my lord?\" Peter replied.\n\nBut as soon as he began to get close the Romans roared, \"NO!\" and viciously chopped off poor Peters Legs.\n\nPeter, wallowing in pain, heard his messiah call him again, \"Peeetteeer... peeter,\" growing more faint with each call.\n\nSo once again Peter tried, crawling with his arms... pulling as hard as he could.\n\nSuddenly, more sharp Roman swords fell upon him. They took his arms this time, leaving him limbless.\n\nBut as he lay there, face down in the mud, Peter heard the Son of God once more, \"Peeteer\"\n\nSo Peter rolled this time with all his might, reaching the bottom of the cross, \"Yes my lord, Yes, Yes,\" he screamed with anticipation, \"how can I serve you?\"\n\nAnd in his fading breaths, whimpering and quiet, Jesus replied, \"Peeter... Peter... I... I can see your house from here!\"",

        "body": "There once was a man named Yuri.\n\nYuri had lived in Russia all of his life, in a small town near Moscow. The town had horrible weather conditions almost all of the time and very few people lived there. Everyone living in the town was struggling to survive in such poor conditions. Yuri had lived alone in a small house in this town. He worked every day at a factory that was close to this town. It was hard work, and Yuri was never very happy with his work, but he kept enduring the rough conditions to be able to have an income. Yuri's life had been like this for several years, and he had endured many hardships during these times.\n\nEvery day, while Yuri was taking his walk to the factory before work began, he always passed by a large billboard on the side of the road. The billboard changed every month or so, usually showing an irrelevant advertisement for something that Yuri had little interest in. Today, however, Yuri noticed a new advertisement on the billboard. It read, \"SWIMMING LESSONS\" in large letters, accompanied by a picture of a large man swimming through the water. This ad had given Yuri something to be interested in. He had always had an intense passion for swimming, but it was always too difficult to practice in the frigid waters of the lake near his home. Yuri continued to read the ad before he finally came to the price: 5000 Rubles base fee.\n\nYuri was sad, because this was much more than Yuri could afford to spend. However, he thought to himself, \"If I could save up enough money from the factory work, then by the end of the month, I should have enough...\" After this, he decided that day that he would work as hard as he could to make sure he had enough money by the end of the month. He even had to cut back his food supply by just a small amount to still have enough money. Finally, at the end of the month, Yuri finally had enough money to be able to go to the swimming pool not far from his home where the practices were being held.\n\nEvery day after his hard work at the factory, he greatly enjoyed going back to the pool and practicing his swimming. He had started quickly and advanced rapidly. Everyone who frequented the pool to practice their swimming was impressed by Yuri's natural ability to be able to learn and adapt so quickly, becoming very popular with the people at the pool, his hometown, and even in Moscow. It was truly a passion of Yuri's.\n\nA few months had passed, and Yuri's amazing swimming abilities had been noticed by people in places all across Russia, considering a swimming prodigy. Yuri was always modest about his skills, but was humble nonetheless. However, he still had to continue his work at the factory, and live in the same small house he had lived in since he was born. For him, swimming was the one thing that saved him from the cruel and harsh life he lived.\n\nLater that month, on his way to the factory once again, he had noticed that the billboard he so often passed had changed once again. While it was difficult to read in the unrelenting snowstorm, he managed to make out the words \"DIVING PRACTICES\" in big letters. Diving was something that Yuri had also found to be interesting, but could never find the time nor place to practice properly. The pool he went to had no diving boards or excessively deep sections of the pool, so it was hard for Yuri to practice diving. However, this would give him another opportunity to pursue what he wanted to do. He looked down at the bottom of the billboard and saw something that, like the other ad, made his heart drop. The base fee was 7500 Rubles.\n\nYuri knew that it would take another month or two of hard work at the factory to be able to achieve such a high sum of money. The factory was beginning to offer less and less money to Yuri, making life harder on him than it was before. He had to cut back his food money as well to accommodate for this. However, Yuri overcame the hardships in his life and save up just enough money by the end of two months.\n\nThe practices were held at another pool not far from the one he already went to, so it was easy for him to practice both swimming and diving at once. He continued to master his swimming skills while also learning how to practice diving. Much like with swimming, however, he had picked up skills quickly, and it only took him another few months before he had mastered diving.\n\nMany people had heard of Yuri at this point. Several news stories across Russia were focused around Yuri, who was considered to be the best swimmer and diver in the whole country. He continued to remain incredibly modest through all of his interviews. \"It is only something I am fond of, a hobby\" Yuri would say. \"I still have a life in the factory that I must attend to every day. It is a hard life, so swimming and diving are what I use to keep myself healthy.\" Despite his fame and popularity, Yuri did continue to work at the factory day in and day out, receiving little pay and little food for all of his hard work. Despite all of Yuri's hardships, he continued his daily routine of working, swimming, and diving.\n\nFor yet another time, Yuri was on his way to the factory. The billboard had changed once again. Yuri anticipated something exciting on the billboard, and he was not disappointed at what he saw. \"TRAVEL TO AMERICA TODAY!\" read the ad. Yuri was very interested. He had always heard of America, and had heard nothing but positive things about it. The land of the free! It was a very exciting idea to Yuri. However, he knew that with ads like these, he knew they would come at a steep price. Unfortunately, he thought correctly. The boats that traveled to America were advertised as costing 60,000 Rubles.\n\nYuri knew that that kind of sum would come from only another year or so of hard work at the factory. The factory work had become increasingly more difficult every single day, with little pay, food, and free time. However, he endured the next year the same way he endured the previous years: with swimming and diving. It truly was his passion, and Yuri was not sure on how he would have survived without them.\n\nFinally, the year had passed, and Yuri had finally saved up enough Rubles to be able to ride the boat to America. He climbed aboard the boat with all of his possessions with him, all managing to fit in one small suitcase. The boat was somewhat small in size, being able to house only around 20 or so people. The boat set sail across the cold waters of the ocean. About a day had passed when people had finally recognized Yuri, the famed Russian swimmer and diver. They were all very excited to meet Yuri, and had several questions to ask him about his swimming skills. \"It is nothing much, just a passion of mine, that is all. It is something I use to endure the hardships and trials of my life...\" Yuri would always respond to his fans.\n\nOne day the boat had to make a stop at a small island to fill up the boat's gas supply, for they had much less than they had expected to have. It was a nice, sunny day outside, and the water was said to be very warm. One of the passengers asked Yuri to show off some of his diving techniques to his fans, since they had time to kill before the boat would depart again. \"Hey, Yuri! While we wait, could you show us some of your diving skills? I would LOVE to see them!\" Yuri was hesitant at first. Another passenger asked, \"And maybe once you have done that, could you show us your swimming techniques? The water is warm, and it would make my day to see them!\" Yuri replied, \"Well... ok, if you all insist I do it.\"\n\nYuri looked off the side of the boat. On the bottom of the boat, a balcony extended from the bottom. Yuri feared he might hit the balcony on his dive down, but everyone else assured Yuri that he wouldn't hit it in a million years. Yuri stepped up over the railing, onto the side of the boat. With the same skill that he had used so many times before, he demonstrated his graceful diving skills by performing his favorite dive he knew. His fans watched in amazement as his body twirled through the air beautifully, showing the same amount of skill he put into each of his other dives. As he dove down towards the war waters below, people watched and expected for Yuri to land smoothly in the water.\n\nUnfortunately, Yuri never landed in the water. He landed instead on the solid, hard deck of the boat's balcony below. The impact sounded painful, and all of the spectators winced on pain over his fall. Yuri remained motionless for several seconds, and his fans began to worry. Many people were about to call for medics when Yuri managed to get up slowly. \"Are you alright Yuri? That fall looked hard! That must have broken some bones!\" Yuri, however, had barely an injury. As he had gotten up, he simply regained his sense of direction. This had amazed several people, as that kind of a fall would have surely broken any other person's bones, if not killed them. Instead, Yuri simply stood up with barely a scratch, and waved back at the row of spectators.\n\n\"It is OK, everybody\" Yuri yelled back. \"I have endured many hardships in my life.\"",

As they were walking past, the rich man wasn't keeping an eye on his daughter, who was playing with the bars of the railing and she slipped through and fell in. Not knowing how to swim himself, the man shouted for help. Without saying a word, the hobo got up, took off his clothes, and dove in. Mid-air, he performed three perfect flips, and on entry, made not a single ripple accross the water. Grabbing hold of the little girl he swam ashore to her father.\n\n\"Oh my goodness! Thank you so much! I couldn't help but notice that you dive beautifully, I will reward you with $500 if you can do that again.\". Without saying a word, the hobo got back on to the bridge and did it again, this time managing to flip four times, with another perfect entry. Astounded, the man says \"I'll double my price if you do it again.\" Again, the hobo climbed on to the bridge, dove off and had a perfect entry, not one ripple accross the water.\n\nThe rich man paid the hobo and said \"Look, I'm pretty rich, I recently bought a cruise ship and I'm looking for attractions, how would you like to come work for me and show the world your skills? How about we go for a world record for highest dive while we're at it? I'll give you 50% of all I own if you dive off the world's tallest diving platform like you did today.\" The homeless man agreed, and he was allowed to live on the ship while the diving platform was being constructed.\n\nWhen construction began, the platform climbed high into the sky, past the atmosphere, into space, it went past Mars, past Jupiter, slowly got built past Saturn, Neptune, and finally stopped at Pluto. When it was finished the hobo began his climb. He climbed all the way past the atmosphere, into space, past Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and arrived on the platform by Pluto.\n\nBy now, the boat was at max capacity and a large crowd had gathered to watch the spectacle, TV cameras televised the event, a whole campaign of cheering people were following this story. The hobo took a minute's rest after the climb and dove off. He began flying down towards the earth, perfect flip after flip. He flipped past Neptune, he flipped past Saturn, he flipped past Jupiter and Mars, all the while maintaining his perfect golden form. He entered the atmosphere and began to straighten himself for entry into the pool aboard the ship.\n\nHe dove in, again, not a single ripple made its way accross the pool surface. However, as you would have guessed, the pool was much too shallow, and he continued to go deeper. He dove past the bedrooms, past the cabin crew level, the engine, and through the hull, the ship began to sink and everyone panicked.\n\nAs the ship was going under, the rich man swam over to the hobo, too amazed to lament his cruise ship he asked: \n\"How on earth did you do that? You're completely unscathed! The entry was perfect! You obliterated the ship!\" After a moment's silence, the hobo finally spoke.\n\n\"I'm a hobo, I've been through many hardships in my life\"\n\n\n*Edit: There are inconsistencies but I ain't gon' hide them.

He had never been to the Congo so upon arrival he asked several locals who the best guide for hunting Gorillas would be. Everyone told him to find a man named Joffe as he was an expert in hunting gorillas. Soon the hunter found Joffe and negotiated a payment for his hunting expedition.\n\nThe next day he arrived to find Joffe ready to go holding a leash with a vicious looking dog attached. All of his men had cages on their backs. \"That's odd\" thought the hunter but he had never hunted gorillas and decided not to say anything. Soon they set off into the forest.\n\nAfter about an hour of walking Joffe suddenly stopped and crouched down. he tapped the hunter on the shoulder and pointed into a tree where a large gorilla was clinging to a branch. The hunter started to raise his rifle but Joffe pushed it down saying, \"not yet, not yet, but be ready and I will tell you when to shoot\". The hunter was confused and stood there while Joffe dropped the leash and ran like a wild man through the jungle. He leaped up into the tree and grabbed the trunk and shook the tree with all his might. The surprised gorilla couldn't hold on to the shaking tree and he fell to the ground. The instant the gorilla fell the dog took off like a shot and grabbed the gorilla's balls in his sharp teeth. Both the dog and the gorilla froze. One of the men came and loaded the gorilla into a cage, pulled it up onto his back and the hunting party moved on.\n\n\"This is the craziest damn thing I've ever seen\" thought the hunter, but he knew Joffe was an expert so he held his tongue. After another hour Joffe stopped short and pointed into another tree. Again the hunter raised his rifle but again Joffe pushed it down saying, \"not yet, not yet, but be ready and I will tell you when to shoot\". And like before Joffe ran through the jungle and leapt into the tree, shaking it furiously. The gorilla fell and the dog clamped its jaws around the gorilla's testicles. Again the gorilla froze and one of the men loaded it up into a cage.\n\nAt this point the hunter is getting a little frustrated. He came to hunt gorillas after all, not to watch this crazy display. But still he stayed silent and this same series of events happened with Joffe telling him each time to put his gun down but to be ready to shoot.\n\nAt this point the hunter was angry and told Joffe, \"look, I came here to shoot! I'm tired of just roaming through the jungle and watching.\" Joffe told him not to worry, \"you just be ready and you will need to shoot soon enough.\" Just as before the came across a gorilla in a tree and again he was told to be ready. Joffe sprinted across the clearing, jumped into the tree and shook with all his might. But this time the gorilla held on and did not let go, in his anger the gorilla shook the tree back and Joffe lost his grip and started to fall. As he headed for the ground Joffe started shouting, \"QUICK! SHOOT THE DOG! SHOOT THE DOG!!\"",

So he's all, \"YEAH?  You got somethin' to say to me, pal?  You wanna do this???  We can get fresh together - we can get Jared jackin' off juniors, 'SUBWAY' sweet onion teriyaki fresh.  Bring that mouth over here and see what happens tough guy.\"\n\n\nBartender, he's floored.  He's floored, but he ain't gonna let that get to 'em.  Looks that unreduced fraction dead in his freakin' eyes and you know what he says?\n\n\n\"Hey buddy...  Why the long expression?\"\n\n\nFraction don't like this none too much, starts gettin' up in the bartender's face and he's all, \"I can EXPRESS myself however I want, and  I don't need YOU or nobody else to gimme no stinkin' lip about it.\"\n\n\nOh jeez now the bartender, he's about had it, starts comin' in with,\n\n\n\"Whoa, whoa, whoa... you can't be doin' this!  This is a bar for Christ's sake!  You're sittin' here with your 'tree over your two, talkin' a big mess about expression.  It ain't proper, pal.  You know what in fact it's IMPROPER what you're doin' right now.  That's what it is.\"\n\n\nNow get this, the fraction...?  He starts BREAKIN' down, man.  You had to see this - he's just fallin' all over the place, cryin' and shit.  Just bitch-sobbin' all about \"I ain't got no balance no more!  I'm all mixed up!!\"  Oh man, that bartender had reduced him down to just about nothin'.  \n\n\nBut he feels bad, y'know!  He don't want no part of this numerical molestation.  Starts consoling the poor guy.  'Bout five minutes later, I be damned if he didn't start lookin' like a million bucks.  Gave him whatever he needed to feel whole again, seemed like. \n\n\nThen - get this - I'm turned away a second, turn back and they're arguin' again!  Apparently, after \"feelin' whole\" again as he kept sayin, he starts gettin' nasty with the bartender - just real fuckin' negative, I heard.  Bartender presses him, goin' for the root of the issue - you know, try and figure all this out.  And that's when he really lost it.  He starts tossin' stools, breakin' mugs - you name it.  Bartender finally pipes up,\n\n\n\"YOU gotta get outta here, buddy!!  I don't need this kinda irrational nonsense messin' up my bar.\"\n\n\nAfter that, dude just kinda sat there goin' on forever.  Not repeatin' nothin', just goin' on and on.  Door guy kicked him out couple minutes later.  Irrational, just like the bartender said.  That's how I'd put it anyway.",

They were walking away from a plane crash, uninjured, when they were captured by a cannibalistic indigenous tribe of indians.\nTaking the 3 men to the tribe's village, they were told by the only english speaking man that they were to be eaten, skinned and have their bones used for paddles and skin for their canoes. The english speaking villager then said \" As is our custom, all of our prisoners are allowed one request before death other then freedom\".\n\nLooking at each man as they pondered, he goes to the white man and and asks what is his final request.  The white man looks at him and says it has been a long time since I had a woman. The villager brings out 3 young women from the tribe and they take him to the nearest hut to have sex.\n\nThe villager then turns to the black man and asks what would his final request be.  The black ponders and starts crying as he is asking if he could write one letter to his family before he died to tell them he loves them. The villager nods and tells him the village will send the letter to a neighboring town that has postal access. \n\nAs the black man walks to the hut to write his good byes, the villager turns to the puerto rican and asks him what his final request is. The man ponders for a bit and asks for a fork and to see his friends one last time. The villager is confused and asks if he is sure. The villager tells him we have women drugs and alcohol. The man tells him \"Just a fork\"\n\nThe men are rounded up finally and as the english speaking villager walks away after giving the fork to the puerto rican.  The puerto rican grips his fork and starts stabbing the shit out the black guy and the white guy, and finally himself all while shouting fuck this boat, fuck that boat, and fuck this boat.\n\n\n",

The Scotsman was shocked that \u2028the Arab did not reciprocate his kind gesture as he had anticipated.\n\nHe then phoned the Arab and asked him: \"I thought you would be more generous than that. Last time you sent me a BMW, diamonds and money, but this time you only sent me a lousy thank-you card and a crappy box of chocolates?\"\u2028 \n\nTo this the Arab replied: \"Aye, laddie, but I now have Scottish blood in me veins.\"",

The owner groans with understanding and steps into the back room, and come back with a black box tied with a black bow. He explains to the man that this is the voodoo dick, a cursed dildo that will fuck anything you tell it to mercilessly. He explains that you just call out to the dildo by its name \"Voodoo Dick\" and tell it what to fuck. The man scoffs and laughs at the store owner. The store owner smiles and simply says \"Voodoo dick, doorknob\". The bow slid itself undone, and the lip came off the box as a black dildo hovered out of the box for a moment and launched itself at the doorknob of the front door. It the proceeded to plow the doorknob through the door. As the man stood slack jawed the store owner said \"Voodoo Dick, return\" and the dildo went back into its box, and the owner asked if that would be cash or charge?\n\nAs the man was leaving for his trip he presented the black box to this wife and told her that this toy would satisfy her until he was able to get home and told her to just call it by name, tell it what to fuck, and she would not be disappointing. Within a day the wife was itching to feel a cock inside her and pulled out the black box. She giggled at the thought but commanded \"Voodoo Dick, my pussy\" Much to her amazement the dildo rose out of the box and plunged itself deep into her. Within a minute she was curling her toes and spasming with sheer ecstasy. Instantly in love, she shouts Yes, Yes, just like that! The voodoo dick keeps going and before she knows it she is having multiple orgasms, one after another. After about an hour she decides to take a rest, but as she goes to pull the Voodoo Dick out of her, it pulled against her. Easily overpowering her, and continuing to fuck her hard and deep. She realizes that she doesn't know how to make it stop, and before long panic starts setting in. She decides she has to get to the hospital for help. She makes her way out of the house and into her car stopping every few steps in the midst of a body shaking orgasm. She gets on the road and makes her way towards the hospital shivering every second. It is not long before A police officer sees her swerving on the road and quickly pulls her over. As he approaches the car he finds a panicked and moaning woman gasping between moans that a magic voodoo dick her husband got her won't stoop fucking her.

Laden with all these new possessions, I go and sit at a table. And don't ask me what the table was like because this was some time ago and I can't remember.

He is sitting there opposite me.\"\n \"What's he look like?\"\n \"Perfectly ordinary. Briefcase. Business suit. He didn't look,\" said Arthur, \"as if he was about to do anything weird.\"\n \"Ah. I know the type. What did he do?\"\n \"He did this. He leaned across the table, picked up the packet of biscuits, tore it open, took one out, and...\" \n\"What?\" \n\"Ate it.\" \n\"What?\" \n\"He ate it.\"\n Fenchurch looked at him in astonishment.\n \"What on earth did you do?\"\n \"Well, in the circumstances I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do. I was compelled,\" said Arthur, \"to ignore it.\"\n \"What? Why?\"\n \"Well, it's not the sort of thing you're trained for is it? I searched my soul, and discovered that there was nothing anywhere in my upbringing, experience or even primal instincts to tell me how to react to someone who has quite simply, calmly, sitting right there in front of me, stolen one of my biscuits.\" \"Well, you could...\" \n\nFenchurch thought about it. \"I must say I'm not sure what I would have done either. So what happened?\" \"I stared furiously at the crossword,\" said Arthur. \"Couldn't do a single clue, took a sip of coffee, it was too hot to drink, so there was nothing for it. I braced myself. I took a biscuit, trying very hard not to notice,\" he added, \"that the packet was already mysteriously open...\" \"But you're fighting back, taking a tough line.\" \"After my fashion, yes. I ate a biscuit. I ate it very deliberately and visibly, so that he would have no doubt as to what it was I was doing. When I eat a biscuit,\" Arthur said, \"it stays eaten.\" \n\"So what did he do?\"\n \"Took another one. Honestly,\" insisted Arthur, \"this is exactly what happened. He took another biscuit, he ate it. Clear as daylight. Certain as we are sitting on the ground.\"\n Fenchurch stirred uncomfortably. \n\"And the problem was,\" said Arthur, \"that having not said anything the first time, it was somehow even more difficult to broach the subject a second time around. What do you say? \"Excuse me...I couldn't help noticing, er...\" Doesn't work. No, I ignored it with, if anything, even more vigor than previously.\"\n \"My man...\" \n\"Stared at the crossword, again, still couldn't budge a bit of it, so showing some of the spirit that Henry V did on St. Crispin's Day...\"\n \"What?\"\n \"I went into the breach again.

As it happened, my train was announced a moment or two later, so I finished my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper...\"\n\n \"Yes?\"\n\n \"Were my biscuits.\"\n \"What?\" said Fenchurch.\n \"What?\" \n\"True.\" \"No!\" She gasped and tossed herself back on the grass laughing.

While waiting for the light to change, an frail looking old man on a yellow moped pulls up next to him. The old man looks over at the Ferrari and asks, \"What kind of car ya' got there, Sonny?\"\nThe young man replies, \"A Ferrari GTO. It cost half a million dollars!\"\n\"Wheeewee... that's a lot of money,\" says the old man as he tucks his thumbs up against his suspenders. \"Why does it cost so much?\"\n\"Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!\" states the banker proudly.\nThe moped driver asks, \"Mind if I take a look inside?\"\n\"No problem,\" replies the proud new owner. So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around at all the bells and whistles lining the dashboard. Sitting back on his moped, the old man whistles and says, \"That's a pretty nice car, all right... but I'll stick with my moped!\"\nJust then the light changes, so the banker decides to show the old man just what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 160 mph! Suddenly, he notices a yellow dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be getting closer! He slows down to see what it could be, and suddenly... Whoooooosssshhhhh! Something blows by him, going much faster!\n\"What in the hell could be going faster than my Ferrari?\" the young man asks himself. He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 250 mph. Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it's the old man on the moped! Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 275 mph. Whoooooosssshhhhh!\nHe's feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him again! Dumbfounded, the banker floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 320 mph. Not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again!\nThe Ferrari red lines and there's nothing more he can do! Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end. The young man stops and jumps out, and unbelievably, the old man is still alive. He runs up to the mangled old man and says, \"Oh my God! Is there anything I can do for you?\" The old man whispers with his dying breath... \"Unhook... my... suspenders... from... your.... side view mirror.\"",

If you have a cat, you are a homo. A cat is like a dog, but queer-- it\n grooms itself constantly but never scratches itself, has a delicate touch\n except when it uses its claws, and whines to be fed. And just think about\n how you call a dog..... 'Killer, come here! I said get your ass over here,\n Killer!' Now think about how you call a cat...'Bun-bun, come to daddy,\n snookums! Jeeez, you're so queer.\n\n 3. If you suck on lollipops, Ring-Pops, or any such nonsense, rest \n assured,\n you are a Gaylord. A straight man only sucks on BBQ ribs, crab claws, raw\n oysters, lobster backs, pickled pigs feet, or tits. Anything else and you\n are a Homo in training and undeniably a fag.\n\n 4. If you refuse to take a dump in a public bathroom or piss in a parking\n lot, you crave a deep homosexual relationship. A man's world is his \n toilet;\n he defecates and urinates where he pleases.\n\n 5. If you drink anything other than regular coffee, you're as fairy as\n Tinkerbelle. A straight man will never be heard ordering a 'Decaf Soy\n Latte'. If you've put a Decaf Soy Latte to your lips, you've had a man \n there\n too..\n\n 6. If you know more than six names of non-standard colors or four \n different\n types of dessert other than ice cream and custard, you might as well be\n handing out free ass passes. A real man doesn't have memory space in his\n brain to remember all of that crap. If you can pick out chartreuse you're\n gay. And if you can name ANY type of textile other than cotton or denim, \n you\n are a peter puffer.\n\n 7. If you drive with both hands on the wheel, forget it, you're dying to\n tune a meat whistle. A man only puts both hands on the wheel to honk at a\n slow-assed driver or to cut the prick off. The rest of the time he needs\n that hand to change the radio station, eat a hamburger, or hold his beer.\n\n 8. If you do not send this off to all the males on your email list because\n you are afraid of hurting their feelings then you are definitely on the\n verge of being a salami smuggler.\n",

Few hours pass and I remember the frog, so I flick over to the lottery results just to reassure myself, and would you fvcking believe it, the numbers are right! The bloody frog was right!! Quick as I can I run straight back to the park, find the same rock and there he is, so I start to apologise \"Mate, I'm so sorry, I had no idea frogs could be magic, I checked the numbers and you were right!! I'm so sorry, can you find it in your heart to forgive me, and tell me next week's winning numbers?\" The frog considers this, and says \"Welllll you were a bit of a d!ck to me earlier, not believing me and all, kinda hurtful you know\" and I'm \"Mate I will do anything, anything you want, you want a box of flies? I can get them, whatever you want, I'll do it!\" The frog seems pleased and says \"What about a wee stroke, will you give me a wee stroke on the head?\" I'm like \"Of course mate! Anything you want\" and give him a wee stroke on the head. He's like \"That was great, thanks. Now how about a wee kiss on the head? Would that be ok?\" I'm like well this is a little weird but fvck it it's lots of money so I give him a kiss on the head, and he says \"Right that was fantastic. One last thing, and I'll tell you all the lottery numbers you want - I want you to fvck me. Really fvck me\" Okaaaaay. Well, this isn't what I'd planned, but, it's a roll-over jackpot, it would change my life, for like 5 minutes of weirdness we're talking overnight multi-millionaire, right fvck it I'll do it!

As she grew to the age when suitors started appearing, the king grew paranoid that she would be whisked away by some secret lover in the dead of night, never to be seen again.   \nTo stop this happening, the king stationed three guards outside her door every night to watch over her.  \nHowever, he began to grow suspicious of the guards themselves, thinking that they were sleeping with his darling girl. He was correct - every night, the guards would go in to the princess's chamber one by one, have crazy, vigourous sex with her and then leave to allow the next guard in.  \nThe king came up with a failsafe plan to catch the guards. One night, he slipped his daughter a temporary sleeping pill at dinner and put her to bed, soundly asleep. As he was tucking her in, he placed ground glass shards inside and around her vagina, hidden from view. He then left, stationed the guards outside her door, and went to bed.  \nAs soon as they were sure it was safe, the first guard went inside the room, and a few moments later the two guards outside heard an agonised scream from inside. The guard came stumbling out crutching his crotch. Too proud to admit what had happened, and not wanting to be the only one, he told the other two that he'd never had better sex, that it was absolutely incredible tonight.  \nThe second guard rubbbed his hands in excitement and went in. The same thing happened. A few moments later, he let out a muffled, agonised scream and came running out of the room, also holding his crotch. As the first guard, he was too proud to admit what had happened, so he told the third guard (who by now was super excited) that she was feeling super freaky tonight and it was an incredible experience.  \nThe third guard ran in, and the other two stayed outside, waiting for the scream, but there was nothing. Just absolute silence.\n\nThe next morning, the king called all three guards to his throne room. He asked the first guard to drop his pants. He did so, and his penis was covered with glass, blood, completely shredded. The king smiled, and ordered his head be cut off.  \nThen the king called up the second guard, and told him to drop his pants. The same thing happened - but worse. His penis was actually fully split down the middle, covered in shards of glass and blood. The king smiled, and ordered his head be cut off.  \nFinally, the king turned to the third guard, and told him to drop his pants. Fully expecting to see another mangled penis, the king was taken aback when he saw a perfectly intact specimen of a penis, gloriously free of blood and glass. Furiously, the king screamed \"HOW DID YOU MANAGE THIS?! WHAT DID YOU DO!?\"  \nThe guard just looked mornfully at him, and replied \"Mmmff mfffmmff mmfff...\"",

The old rooster sees it strutting around and gets a little worried.\n\n\"So they're tryna replace me, eh?\" the old rooster thinks.  \"I'll show them!\"\n\nIt walks up to the new bird and says \"so you think you're the new stud in town?  I bet you really think you're hot stuff don't you?  Well, I'm not ready for the chopping block yet.

You're on, and since I'm so great you can even have a half a lap headstart and I'll still win easy!\"\n\nSo the two roosters head over to the hen house to start the race with all the hens gathering to watch.  The race begins and all the hens start cheering the old rooster on.  After the first lap, he's still maintaining his lead.  However, with each lap the old rooster lets it slip a little as the new guy catches up.  It's the seventh lap and each rooster is frantically sprinting, with the old rooster just barely leading.\n\nBy now, the farmer has heard all the commotion.  He grabs his gun and runs into the barnyard, figuring a fox or something is after his chickens.  When he gets there, he sees the two roosters running around the hen house with the old one still lightly in the lead as they near the last lap.  The farmer takes aim with his shotgun and blows the young rooster to smithereens.\n\nWalking away in bewilderment, he mutters to himself, \"damn, that's the third, gay rooster I've bought this month!\"",

Here about the bellringer job, I am!\" He spoke enthusiastically. \n\n\"Of course my son, of course.... but I must ask - how will ye accomplish the task of ringing the bell? I cannae help but notice, ye have no arms, lad.\"\n\n\"Ah! Not a problem!

That was incredible! Sure ye can have the job - be here at sunrise tomorrow to ring the bell, by God! You will be doing this town a great service!\"\n\nThe next day, just before dawn,  the armless man ascended the tower, keen to impress on his first day on the job.\n\nHe waits until sunrise, approaches the bell and just as before, sticks his head up inside and begins smacking his face on the inside, throwing his body forward with every ring.\n\nDangerously so, the armless man begins to lose balance...\n\nBong\n\nBONG\n\n**Ahhhhhhh!!!**\n\nhe misses on the third strike, and falls off the edge of the tower, and\n\n**THUD**\n\nHits the ground dead!

Knocking on the door he was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, gray beard. \"I'm lost,\" said the man. \"Can you put me up for the night?\" \n\n\"Certainly,\" the Chinese man said, \"but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man.\" \n\n\"OK,\" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. Before dinner the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal - it didn't hurt his chances that he was the first man she had seen besides her father in years. Remembering the old man's warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear and, near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy.\n\nHe woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest. The old man was standing over him \"First Chinese torture test: Large rock on chest.\" \"Well, that's pretty crappy,\" he thought. \"If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about.\" He picked the boulder up, waddled over to the window and heaved the boulder out. As he did so the old man smiled softly, \"Second Chinese torture test: Rock tied to left testicle.\" In a panic he glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted downward the old man leaned out the window with a large grin, \"Third Chinese torture test: Right testicle tied to bedpost.\" ",

With all the exames at hand, they start talking:\n\n\nDoctor: Yes, I know that kind, its a tough son of a b*tch, I dealt with it before and I can kill it.

If you trust me, I am quite sure we can get rid of the worm.\n\n\nNext day the woman arrives at the clinic with both items and enter the doctor's private room:\n\nDoctor: Okay, now I need you to be upside down.\n\nWoman: What??\n\nDoctor: Trust me, we'll get that rascal, we'll show it.\n\nWoman: Okay then.\n\n\nSo the doctor starts to insert slowly the breadroll inside the woman's anus and she starts to scream in pain.

I am fed up with this, I've been feeling too much pain with this treatment and didnt see any result. When will this end?\nDoctor: Do not worry, it will end tomorrow. You will come here tomorrow, but bring only the breadroll.

Although the Japanese girl spoke very little English and the businessman spoke no Japanese, their passion roared and in the heat of the moment she began yelling \"Gama Su!, Gama Su!\". Hearing this, the Californian knew he had pleased his female Japanese friend and soon afterwards went to sleep. The next day while playing golf with his Japanese business colleagues, one of his Japanese partners holed his shot from 170 yards away! Everyone went crazy and began yelling excitedly in Japanese. Wanting to impress his friends, the Californian joined in and began yelling, \"Gama Su! Gama Su!\" Suddenly everyone became quiet. After a moment of silence, one of the Japanese turned to him and asked \"Wrong hole? What do you mean, 'wrong hole'?\"",

He looks around and sees lots of dildos, sex dolls, vibrators and etc, but nothing that would keep his wife occupied for 3 weeks. So he asks the clerk, who happens to be the store owner, and though at first the clerk says there is nothing there that would keep a person satisfied for that long, after some badgering, he finally pulls a black ebony box with a gold clasp from underneath the counter--all the while assuring the newlywed that it's not for sale, being a family heirloom and of priceless sentimental value. He opens the box, and inside is an apparently normal dildo. The newlywed guy is unimpressed, but the clerk interrupts. \"Let me demonstrate,\" he says. He looks at the box and says \"Voodoo Dick--The Door!\" and the voodoo dick jumps into the air, floats over to the door, and starts going at the keyhole like crazy, pounding away until the door begins to crack down the center. Finally, the clerk says \"Voodoo Dick--The Box!\" and the voodoo dick flies back into the box. With some difficulty, the guy convinces the clerk to sell it to him. \n\n\nWhen he arrives home, he gives his wife the box and says \"Just open it and say, 'voodoo dick, my pussy' if you ever get horny, all right?\" So he leaves on his business trip, and by the third day, the wife is getting pretty horny. So she opens the box and says \"Voodoo dick, my pussy,\" thinking the whole thing rather rediculous. After about 15 minutes, she has had several orgasms and is starting to get tired, so she tries to pull the voodoo dick out. Apparently, her husband had forgotten to tell her how to turn it off. So she puts on a dress and starts driving to the hospital. About half way there, the voodoo dick is pumping away at her, and she starts multiple orgasming, and so she swerves a bit over the yellow line. A police officer happens to be behind her, and pulls her over. As the cop stands at the window, she is sweating and her face is blushed, and she's squirming all over as the voodoo dick goes at her. The cop looks at her for a second and says, \"Lady, how many drinks have you had tonight?\" She says quickly \"Officer, I swear I haven't had anything to drink! there's this voodoo dick going at my pussy and I can't make it stop! I'm on the way to the hospital to have it removed!\" The officer thinks about it for a second, gives her a smirk and says \"Voodoo Dick my ass, lady.\"",

What is Easter?\"\n\nThe first Catholic steps up and says, \"Easter is the holiday when a big fat man comes down your chimney and hands out presents.\"\n\nSaint Peter says, \"No.  That's not right.  That's Christmas.\"\n\nThe second Catholic says, \"Of course, that's Christmas.  Everyone knows Easter is the day when children put on masks and go door to door saying 'trick or treat' and getting candy.\"\n\nSaint Peter says, \"No.  You're thinking of Halloween.  How have you all not heard of Easter?  Do you know what Easter is?\" he says, motioning to the third.\n\nThe final Catholic says, \"I apologize for my friends.  I know what Easter is.  Easter is when our lord and savior Jesus Christ was crucified under Pontius Pilate for the forgiveness of our sins.  He suffered, died, and was buried.  They put his body in a tomb and rolled a big stone in front of it.  On the third day,  the disciples rolled the rock away, and they saw Jesus Christ had risen from the dead in fulfillment of the scriptures...\"\n\n\"That's an excellent answer!\" St. Peter exclaimed.\n\n\"...and as he rose from the dead, Christ saw his shadow and we got six more weeks of winter.\"",

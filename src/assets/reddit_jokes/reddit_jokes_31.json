I asked him what he wanted to change it to, and he said \n\n\"lee, like bruce lee or some shit.\"  \n\nI was failing trigonometry at the time, and so I thought what the hell, and offered to help him in exchange for him doing my homework.  Ling overheard us and chimed in,\n\n \"If you do that, father will disown you as our child.  That name has been in our family line for generations.\"  \n\nVing never really listened to his sister though, and he still wanted to go through with the plan.  The next day after school, I drove him to the town hall.  After we arrived, he had gotten the name-change sheet and was scribbling down information on to it when I saw his face change.  I could tell he was extremely conflicted with his choice.  Tears began to stream down his face.  He finally decided that he was gonna have to cancel his request, and Ling looked relieved.  The receptionist let us know that there would be a cancelation fee, and handed the fee waiver to her. Suddenly, A short asian man with neon shorts, ray-bans, and an american flag t-shirt bursted into the room.  Ving turned in awe and stared at the man, as tears rolled down his cheeks.  \n\n\"D-D-Dad?\" \n\nWith a huge smile on his face, the man ran up and embraced his son. \n\n\"Don't stop, be Lee, Ving.\n\n Hold on the that fee, Ling\"\n\n\n_______________________________________________________\n***Yes, this is a modified version of a joke from a 4chan thread.

When it became apparent that we would marry, I made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans. \nSome months later, on my birthday, my car broke down on the way home from work. Since I lived in the countryside I called my wife and told her that I would be late because I had to walk home. On my way, I passed by a small diner and the odour of baked beans was more than I could stand. With miles to walk, I figured that I would walk off any ill effects by the time I reached home, so I stopped at the diner and before I knew it, I had consumed three large orders of baked beans. All the way home, I made sure that I released all the gas. \nUpon my arrival, my wife seemed excited to see! me and exclaimed delightedly: \"Darling I have a surprise for dinner tonight.\" \nShe then blindfolded me and led me to my chair at the dinner table. I took a seat and just as she was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. She made me promise not to touch the blindfold until she returned and went to answer the call. The baked beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming most unbearable, so while my wife was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a pulpwood mill. I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other cheek, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable. When eventually the telephone farewells signalled the end of my freedom, I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my wife returned, apologizing for taking so long. She asked me if I had peeked through the blindfold, and I assured her I had not. At this point, she removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table chorused: \"Happy Birthday!\" ",

One day his friends come over to his house, and they say \"look man, you've got to come to the dance next week, it'll be fun, and you haven't done anything in ages.\" The man stubbornly refuses, until his friends stop pestering him about it, but the next day, they come back, and say \"well, we've got a bit if a surprise for you... We've put together enough money to buy you a fake eye.\" The man says \"that's great! thanks so much!\" His friends then say, \"but, you have to promise to come to the dance once you've got one. The man thinks it over, he's still a bit embarrassed, but eventually agree. So the man and his friends drive to the eye store and walk up to the man at the counter. \"Hello,\" says one of the eyeless mans friends, \"we're here to buy a fake eye for our friend here, do you have any in stock?\" The nan at the counter says \"we certainly do, and walks into the back of the shop, returning later with a box of beautiful glass eyes. \"These a very good quality eyes,\" the man said \"they're hand painted, and we have a match for pretty much any eye colour. \"Great!\" Says one of the mans friends, \"how much do they cost?\" \"Well\" says the man at the counter, \"these are very good quality, so you're looking at around $1500 to $2000\" \"well\" says the mans friend, \"we don't really have that much to spend... Do you have any others?\" \"Certainly,\" says the man at the counter who puts the lid back on the glass eyes, walks into the back of the shop, coming back with a box full of plastic eyes. \"These ones are also hand painted, but they aren't as well-painted as the glass eyes, and they aren't quite as matching, but they are still rather indistinguishable from normal eyes. \"Right,\" say the mans friends, \"how much do they cost?\" \"Um... These,\" says the salesman \"will cost around $900\" \"sorry,\" says the man to his friend, \"but we don't have quite enough for those, either. Do you have any more?\" He says, turning back to the man at the counter. \"We do have some wood eyes, says the man at the counter,\" he then produces a box from under the counter. \"These wood eyes aren't hand painted, and won't be able to get a really good colour match, but we can find a passable colour, I'm sure.\" Says the man at the counter, \" and they'll only cost about $120\" \"right\" says the eyeless mans friend, \"we'll take this one then.\" He takes a dark green eye from the box, and gives it to his friend, handing the man at the counter the money. The friends drive home, trying to cheer the eyeless man up, as they eye isn't entirely convincing. \"It's okay,\" says the eyeless mans friend it'll be fine, it won't even be that light at the dance, and your eye won't show.\" So the man reluctantly goes to the dance the next week. Once arriving at the dance, the man sits alone in a corner until everyone else has a dance partner. The mans three friends come over to him, and encourage him to get a partner, \"how about her over there?\" The mans friend points to a woman sitting alone in a corner on the other side of the room. \"Come on,\" prompts his friend \"you can't have come all this way for nothing.\" \"Alright,\" says the man, \"I'll ask her to dance. As he walks over he realises the lady has a bit of a hunch back, and starts having second thoughts. \"I'm no better\" says the man to himself, and someone's up his courage and asks her to dance. \"Would you like to have an dance\" asks the man. \"Would I!?

        "body": "There once was an old cathedral in rural England. It was near a small village and most of the people that lived there attended church every week. This was a sad time for the people of this village, as the much beloved bell ringer for the church had fallen ill and died.\n\nThe head minister of this cathedral had taken the death quite hardly, as he had been good friends with the man. Reluctantly, he put up a notice in the village square that they would be needing a replacement bell ringer. He knew that a man for the job was needed before the funeral of the old ringer.\n\nNow, the day after notice was posted, the minister was in his study reading when a young man no older than 20 walked in. The minister looked up and asked, \"What can I do for you, young man?\"\n\nThe man, visibly eager to speak, replied, \"I'm here about the posting you've made. I want to be the next bell ringer.\" There was an enthusiasm on this man's face that caught the minister's attention.\n\nThe minister, somewhat recognizing this enthusiasm, inquired, \"Well that may be something we could discuss. But first, I must know, have I seen you here at the church or around town? You seem rather familiar.\"\n\n\"No, sir, I don't believe we've met before,\" the man replied.\n\n\"Ah, well then, it's very nice to make your acquaintance,\" said the minister. He reached out to shake the young man's hand, when he noticed something very out of the ordinary. The man had no arms! The minister pulled back his hand and apologized for the gesture.\n\n\"It's no problem, sir, I've been without them for my whole life, I'm quite used to that.\" The man redirected the conversation back to the job. \"Now, I'd really like to talk about becoming the next bell ringer!\"\n\nThe minister, slightly taken aback, wondered whether the armless man was serious. \"My dear boy, surely you must be joking. You've got no arms! I mean no offense, but there is no way you could pull those heavy ropes to ring the bells.\"\n\nThe young man still had an eagerness about him, insisting that the minister give him a shot. \"I can do it, let me show you! Please sir, I know I can do it. Come with me up the bell tower and I'll show you!\"\n\nAt this point, the minister was wondering whether the man had some sort of brain damage as well. There was absolutely no way a man with no arms could ring those bells. But, being the generous man that he was, the minister decided to at least humor the man and go up into the bell tower with him.\n\nOnce they reached the top of the tower where the bells were held, the minister asked how the young man was going to ring them. \"Like this,\" he simply replied with an odd smile on his face. The man took some step back towards one open arches that made up the bell tower, disregarding the ropes that hung next to him. He began walking slowly, then burst into a sprint, jumped, and smacked his forehead on the edge of the bell.\n\nBWOOOOOOOOONNNG\n\nThe minister couldn't believe it. This armless man had just mad the most beautiful sound he'd ever heard come out of that bell. Astounded, he turned to the man and exclaimed, \"Dear boy, did you really just do that?\"\n\nUnfazed, the young man responded excitedly, \"Yes sir! Would you like me to do it again?\" Without waiting for an answer, the man once again stepped back to the arch, took a running start, jumped, and smacked his forehead against the bell.\n\nBWOOOOOOOOONNNG\n\nNow, the minister was truly speechless. Although his previous thoughts about brain damage were almost certainly proven, he simply could not believe how beautiful the sound was that the bell made. He looked at the man, seeing no sign of harm to his head, but only a smile that showed how confident he was. The minister then made the final decision to make this young man the next bell ringer.\n\nA few days had passed, and it was time for the funeral for the former ringer. Nearly the entire village showed up to mourn his passing. As the funeral dragged on as only funerals can, the newly appointed ringer made his way up the tower to give the bells a good BWONG-ing after the final eulogy had ended. This was his biggest break, his chance to show the entire village that he could be a great ringer. The excitement from that first day had swelled up until this point.\n\nHe listed for the sound of the last \"Amen\" from the congregation. It was his time now. The armless man closed his eyes to take it all in. After a deep sigh, he took some steps back, broke into a run, jumped, and smacked his forehead on the edge of the bell. Then, to his surprise, he tripped on a large old nail as he landed, stumbled toward one of the arches, and, unable to balance himself, fell out of the tower to his death.\n\nBWOOOOOOOOONNNG ... ... ... SPLAT!\n\nThe funeral-goers heard this strange sound and all rushed outside to see what was the matter. To their surprise, they found the newly appointed ringer dead on the ground. The crowd began talking among themselves, wondering who knew this man and whether any of his family was present. One man thought he had recognized the deceased man earlier with a family, but couldn't quite put his finger on it whether it was him or not. Everyone could agree that this man looked familiar.\n\nAs the minister finally reached the body through the crowd, he knelt down and wept beside him. A woman in the crowd asked, \"Father, did you know who this man was?\"\n\n\"No,\" he solemnly answered, \"but his face sure rang a bell.\"",

One of them picks up the lamp and rubs it. The genie comes spiraling out of the lamp and says,\n\n\"I see you have returned. What was was wrong with your wish?\"\n\nThe first guy steps up and says,\n\n\"You see it was going great for a bit, but every time I have sex with my girlfriend, she gets splinters up her butt.\"\n\n\"Very well\", the genie says, \"I shall change it back.\" BAM.

The big day finally arrives; he's finally saved up enough. He goes to the Ministry of Motor Vehicles and after waiting in line for 5 hours, he is finally face-to-face with a bureaucrat and Vladimir proudly announces, \"I would like to purchase a car!\"\n\nThe bureaucrat takes Vlad's rubles, counts them, counts them, counts them again. Then he wordlessly throws Vlad a pile of paperwork which Vlad dutifully fills out (in triplicate!) so that they can proceed. The bureaucrat examines all the paperwork, makes Vladimir re-do some of the pages he screwed up, and then makes his determination: \"I have examined your paperwork and it is sufficient. The rubles you have paid me are sufficient. You can purchase a car. Come back 10 years from today and your car will be ready.\"\n\nUnfazed by this, Vlad asks, \"Will it be ready in the morning or the afternoon?\"\n\nThe bureaucrat is stunned... \"Morning or afternoon? Morning or afternoon? It's 10 years from today! Why do you care if it's in the morning or afternoon?\"\n\nVladimir replies, \"Well, it's just that the plumber's coming by in the morning...\"",

In most sports the ball, or object, is put in play by the offensive team; in baseball the defensive team puts the ball in play, and only the defense is allowed to touch the ball. In fact, in baseball if an offensive player touches the ball intentionally, he's out; sometimes unintentionally, he's out.\n\n\nAlso: in football,basketball, soccer, volleyball, and all sports played with a ball, you score with the ball and in baseball the ball prevents you from scoring.\n\n\nIn most sports the team is run by a coach; in baseball the team is run by a manager. And only in baseball does the manager or coach wear the same clothing the players do. If you'd ever seen John Madden in his Oakland Raiders uniform,you'd know the reason for this custom.\n\nNow, I've mentioned football. Baseball & football are the two most popular spectator sports in this country. And as such, it seems they ought to be able to tell us something about ourselves and our values.\n\nI enjoy comparing baseball and football:\n\n\nBaseball is a nineteenth-century pastoral game.\nFootball is a twentieth-century technological struggle.\n\n\nBaseball is played on a diamond, in a park.The baseball park!\nFootball is played on a gridiron, in a stadium, sometimes called Soldier Field or War Memorial Stadium.\n\n\nBaseball begins in the spring, the season of new life.\nFootball begins in the fall, when everything's dying.\n\n\nIn football you wear a helmet.\nIn baseball you wear a cap.\n\n\nFootball is concerned with downs - what down is it?\nBaseball is concerned with ups - who's up?\n\n\nIn football you receive a penalty.\nIn baseball you make an error.\n\n\nIn football the specialist comes in to kick.\nIn baseball the specialist comes in to relieve somebody.\n\n\nFootball has hitting, clipping, spearing, piling on, personal fouls, late hitting and unnecessary roughness.\nBaseball has the sacrifice.\n\n\nFootball is played in any kind of weather: rain, snow, sleet, hail, fog...\nIn baseball, if it rains, we don't go out to play.\n\n\nBaseball has the seventh inning stretch.\nFootball has the two minute warning.\n\n\nBaseball has no time limit: we don't know when it's gonna end - might have extra innings.\nFootball is rigidly timed, and it will end even if we've got to go to sudden death.\n\n\nIn baseball, during the game, in the stands, there's kind of a picnic feeling; emotions may run high or low, but there's not too much unpleasantness.\nIn football, during the game in the stands, you can be sure that at least twenty-seven times you're capable of taking the life of a fellow human being.\n\n\nAnd finally, the objectives of the two games are completely different:\n\n\nIn football the object is for the quarterback, also known as the field general, to be on target with his aerial assault, riddling the defense by hitting his receivers with deadly accuracy in spite of the blitz, even if he has to use shotgun. With short bullet passes and long bombs, he marches his troops into enemy territory, balancing this aerial assault with a sustained ground attack that punches holes in the forward wall of the enemy's defensive line.\n\n\nIn baseball the object is to go home! And to be safe! - I hope I'll be safe at home!",

        "body": "A travelling salesman is driving along a dusty backroad to his next sale, when his car starts belching smoke. He sees storm clouds coming his way and night is falling soon. Getting out of the car he looks around for shelter and sees an antiquated old monastery on a hill not 5 minutes walk away. He heads over and knocks on the door just as the rain starts falling and a kindly monk answers.  \n\"Hi, my car is broken down on the road\" says the salesman,  \"and I see a storm coming in. Can I stay the night and call a tow truck in the morning? I won't be any trouble...\"  \n\"not at all my good man\" the kindly monk replied, \"Come in! Come in! Lets get you a hot meal and some dry clothes!\"    \n  \nSo the salesman is ushered into the church and given a wonderful bowl of hearty stew and bread to eat. Not realizing his hunger before the salesman devours the \nfood in between words of thanks.   \n\"I don't know how I can repay you people...\"  \n\"well actually\" said the kindly monk who answered the door, \"our abbot bores so easily in the realitive solitude of our church, and he loves to talk with travelers\"  \n\"of course!\" replied the salesman, \"in return for this hospitality its the least i could do\"  \n  \nSo the kindly monk leads the salesman deeper into the monastery and as he does he hears the faintest sound...  \nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...  \nBut the salesman thinks its just the storm outside making noise and pays it no mind. He reaches the abbots quarters and meets a man seemingly as ancient as the building he runs who greets him with a smile and firm handshake.  \nThe two speak to each other at length with hours seeming like minutes as the storm pounds the outside, and all the while the man hears that same noise...  \nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...  \n  \nEventually the conversation draws to a natural end and the abbot looks over the salesman's shoulder.  \n\"good heavens, look at the time. we both should get some rest\" the abbot commented, \"the brother you met before will take you to your chambers for the night\"  \n  \nAnd so the salesman is taken to his spartan looking accommodations, and just as the kindly monk is leaving the room the salesman asks,  \n\"by the way, i keep hearing this strange thumping sound all the time. Its that normal? What is that?\"  \nThe monk looks down at his feet, and for the first time since the salesman came into the monastery the smile falls from his face. He quickly stares at the floor and stammers,  \n\"I-I-I don't know what you're talking about. Sleep well.\" Slamming the door behind him.  \n  \nThe salesmans sleep is restless as now the same sound as before stays next to him, breathing on his neck....  \nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...  \nWhen dawn breaks the salesman calls a tow truck, and while waiting says his goodbyes and thank yous. Finally when the tow truck arrives he turns to the abbot and says,  \n\"thank you so much for everything again, but I must ask; what is that strange thudding noise I hear? The storm is over yet I heard it clearly all night?\"  \nThe monk gains a sudden steel in his eyes and locks them dead onto the salesman.  \n\"I can't tell you, you're not a monk.\"  \nAnd with that, bids him farewell.  \n  \nThe salesman finishes his route without incident, and heads home to his wife and child. But incessantly, as if by hearing it he could no longer un-hear it, at the quietest moments in his life, the salesman hears a soft  \nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...  \n  \nThe seasons pass into years and the years pass into decades. The mans son grows and leaves to be his own man, and after decades of bliss the mans wife passes away peacefully in his arms one morning. As the life leaves his loves eyes the only sound heard is a simple   \nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...  \n  \nWith a life now emptier the thudding becomes constant, unceasing, droning. When he sleeps, eats, shits  \nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...  \n  \nFinally, standing it no longer the man drives all day and night to the same dirt road he so happened to break down upon and every mile, every town he passes as constant as the odometer  \nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...  \n  \nFinally he reaches the monastery and knocks on the door and just as before a fresh faced kinly monk answers.  \n\"I WISH TO JOIN YOUR ORDER\" the man blurts before the monk can say anything. The monk gains a knowing smile and says no more, beckoning the man to follow him.  \n  \nHe leads the man on the same path he took those years and years before and directs him into the abbots room. Inside is the same man as the night he stayed before, looking not a day older.  \n\"Please abbot.\" The man begged, \"I can't stop hearing that thudding noise, night and day I can't escape it. Can't you let me know what it is?\"  \nThe abbot replies with the same steely matter-of-fact tone as he did all those years before,  \n\"I can't tell you, you're not a monk.\"   \n\"Thats what I feared your answer would be. Please then, let me become a monk so I can learn and get this sound from my head.\"  \nThe abbot takes a long look, dripping with both hunger and pity and after a handful of breathes agrees.\"  \n  \nThe training is arduous and lengthy. The salesman is not a young man anymore and the demands, moth mental and physical task him to the core of his very being. He sleeps on stone, reads nothing but the texts of the obscure religious sect he wishes to join and eats nothing but gruel and through every minute, every blister, every headache, every pang of hunger the sound is there.  \nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...   \n  \nFinally after several years worth of trails the man finally is ready to be inducted. The moment after the ceremony inducting him is complete he bolts to the chambers of the abbot.  \n\"There, I did it. I'm a member of the order. NOW TELL ME WHAT THAT NOISE IS.\"     \n\"Are you sure you wish to know?\" the abbot grimaces, \"It will change the way you think of not just the order, or me, but everything.\"  \n\"Yes!\" the man cries \"I've never been more sure of anything in my life!\"  \n\"Very well\" replied the abbot. And with that the sound in the mans head lessened, as if the promise curiosity being fed was able to sate the beast, even if for a moment. But still, even though quieter it was still present.  \nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...  \n  \nThe abbot pulls a seemingly random book off the shelf behind him, and opens it. He reveals it to be hollow and pulls a monstrous set of keys from it and tucks them into his sleeve. He then pulls another book from the shelf and the shelf splits in half and opens like the doors in a supermarket with the sound of the grinding of ancient stone. Where the shelves used to be there is a door made of iron. The abbot pulls the set of keys out with an iron key extended, opens the door and swings it aside. As the man follows the abbot into the path behind the door he notices the sound getting louder.  \nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...   \n  \nThey walk along a dark and musty path, the air like a forgotten wine cellar or crypt with the abbot wordlessly staring forward with grim purpose. He reaches the next door, a door made of polished bronze, reflecting as perfectly as a mirror. He pulls out a bronze key from the keyring in his sleeve and opens the door. Sure enough as the man passes though, a little louder this time  \nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...  \n  \nAfter the bronze door came a staircase, down and down and down it went, until it seemed that they were descending into hell itself. Winding stairs, spiral stairs, branching stairs leading to nowhere and yet the two marched on, reaching a silver door. The abbot pulled out a silver key and as before set the door aside, making the sound ever louder.  \nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...  \n  \nAnd then, it was time to climb. Yet the abbot, a man of innumerable years climbed as surefooted as a goat while the salesman followed behind, exhausted but determined not to give up now. At the apex of the climb, a door of gold was before them. The abbot then pulled a gold key, and in the grim routine as before, the door fell aside and the sound became ever louder. It seemed to be right next to them, a tangible force. A third person on this bizarre trek.  \nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...  \n  \nAfter the golden door came a maze. Dizzying and seemingly endless, the abbot had no hesitation in his step and never second guessed himself. Hours passed in the maze as hours had passed in all the paths before and yet without ever turning around the abbot and the salesman reached a platinum door. As you can guess, platinum key, door, noise.  \nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...  \nAs the man walked into the next door he hesitated for the first time on his trip. The walls themselves seemed to be alive, screaming things in alien tongues as if the brick and mortar where being tortured. Grotesque faces in the masonry screamed as if every injustice upon earth was being visited upon them and yet somehow they could not drown out that sound, pounding louder than it ever had.  \nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...   \n  \nAfter the hours that seemed of days in the pathway that screamed ceaselessly they reached a door, red and pulsing, as if made of some sort of flesh. The abbot pulled out a bony, fleshy....something from his keyring and inserted it into the door. All at once the walls stopped screaming, the flesh melted into nothing on the floor and the sound grew terrible and great. Louder and unchanged.  \nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...  \n  \nBehind the former wall of flesh was not another passage but a box. Wooden small and humble. The abbot pulled out one final key of wood and unlocked and opened the box. As he pulled the box open the sound became deafeningly loud and the man finally looked inside and gave a horrified scream.   \n  \nAnd I'd love to tell you what was inside, but you're not a monk. \n\n\n  ",

The devil came back sometime later, surprised to find the Cajun just sitting around, not even misting, much less sweating.  \"How come you're not so much as sweating here where everyone else is screaming for relief from the heat?\"\nThe Cajun laughed and said, \"Man, I was raised in the bayous of Sout Looziana.  Dis ain't nothin' but May in Morgan City to me!\"\nThe devil decided to really put the Cajun through it. He put him in a sealed off cave in the pit with open blazes and four extra furnaces blasting.  When he came back, days later, the Cajun was sitting pretty, had barely begun to sweat.  The devil was outraged..   \"How is this possible!?  You should be melted to a shrieking puddle in these conditions!.\"\nThe Cajun laughed even harder than before.   \"Hey, man!  I done tole you.  I was raised in Sout Looziana.  You tink dis is heat?!  Dis ain't nothin' but August in Cow Island !\"\nSo the devil thought, 'Alright, a little reverse ought to do the trick.'  He put the Cajun into a corner of hell where no heat ever reached.  It was freezing, and to add to the Cajun's misery, he added massive icebergs and blasting frozen air.  When he returned, the Cajun was shivering, ice hung from every part of him, but he was grinning like it was Christmas.\nExasperated, the devil asked \"HOW!?  How is it possible?!   You're impervious to heat and here you sit in conditions you can't be used to...freezing cold, and yet you're happier than if you were in heaven.  WHY?!\"\nThe Cajun kept grinning and asked, \"Don't dis mean de Saints won da Super Bowl?\"",

Needless to say, all of you have a great deal of work to do in this.

Jake brightens a little. \"Yeah, it's not bad. Check this out\" - and he shows him a time zone display not just for every time zone in the world, but for the 86 largest metropolitan areas. He hits a few buttons and from somewhere on the watch a voice says \"The time is eleven 'til six\" in a very West Texas accent. A few more buttons and the same voice said something in Japanese. Jake continues \"I've put in regional accents for each city\". The display is unbelievably high quality and the voice is simply astounding. The stranger is struck dumb with admiration. \"That's not all,\" says Jake. He pushes a few more buttons and a tiny but very hi-resolution, map of New York City appears on the display. \"The flashing dot shows our location by satellite positioning,\" explains Jake. \"View recede ten,\" Jake says, and the display changes to show eastern New York state. \"I want to buy this watch!\" says the stranger. \"Oh, no, it's not ready for sale yet; I'm still working out the bugs, says the inventor. \"But look at this,\" and he proceeds to demonstrate that the watch is also a very creditable little FM radio receiver with a digital tuner, a sonar device that can measure distances up to 125 meters, a pager with thermal paper printout and, most impressive of all, the capacity for voice recordings of up to 300 standard-size books,\" though I only have 32 of my favorites in there so far\" says Jake.  \"I've got to have this watch!\" says the stranger. \"No, you don't understand; it's not ready.\" \"I'll give you $1000 for it!\"  \"Oh, no, I've already spent more than -\" \"I'll give you $5000 for it!\" \"But it's just not -\" \"I'll give you $15,000 for it!\" And the stranger pulls out a checkbook.

The stranger frantically finishes writing the check and waves it in front of him. \"Here it is, ready to hand to you right here and now. $15,000. Take it or leave it.\" Jake abruptly makes his decision. \"OK,\" he says, and peels off the watch.

He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else. So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation. The old man said, \"Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except.... and he stopped. \"Except what?\" the man asked. \"Nothing, nothing.\" \"C'mon, tell me! I need something!\" \"Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick.'\" \"So what's up with this voodoo dick?\" he asked.\n\nThe old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said \"Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!\" The old man replied, \"But you haven't seen what it'll do yet.\" He pointed to a door and said \"Voodoo dick, the door.\" The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said \"Voodoo dick, get back in your box!\" The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there quiescent once more. \"I'll take it!\" said the businessman. The old man resisted, saying it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say \"Voodoo dick, my pussy.\" He left for his trip satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.\n\nAfter he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said \"Voodoo dick, my pussy!\" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgotten to tell her how to shut it off. So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing.\n\nThe officer looked at her for a second, and then said \"Yeah, right.. Voodoo dick, my ass!\"",

He has a pretty low paying job, so obviously he doesn't have the best of cars.\n\nAfter a few hours of driving, he drives past a monastery. That kind with all the monks.\n\nAnd holy tits, his car breaks down right in front of the monastery.\n\nBeing a man of God, he obviously figures, \"I bet the monks will let me stay with them while my car is repaired.\" So he goes to the front gate and knocks on the door. A man in robes answers.\nHe tells the monk his predicament and the monk, being a monk, lets him stay the night, and even helps with repair costs for his car.\n\nWhile the business man is sleeping that night, he hears this strange noise.\nIt just perplexes him, and for the life of him, he can't figure out what it is. He decides when he wakes up in the morning, he'll ask the monks about it.\n\nWhen he wakes up, he finds the monk who he met when his car first broke down, and asks him, \"Can you tell me what that noise I heard was last night?\"\n\nThe monk replies, \"I'm sorry, brother. I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk.\" The man accepts this. He thanks the monks for their graciousness, and goes about his way when he gets his car back.\n3 years later, he is driving on another buisness trip. And wouldn't you know it, his car breaks down in front of the monastery again.\n\nAgain, he figures, he can stay the night. And, of course, the monks let him stay and offer him the same help as before.\n\nAnd once again, during the night, he hears that noise. He has no idea what it could be. He decides to ask the monk once again, with hopes that he would trust him more this time around.\nIn the morning he meets the monk again, and asks, \"I'm sorry for asking again, but what is that noise!?\"\n\nThe monk replies, \"I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk.\"\n\nThe man says, \"Alright! I'll become a monk! What do I need to do!?\"\n\nThe monk replies, \"I need you to travel the world, and count every blade of grass if you truly wish to become a monk.\"\n\nThe man swiftly accepts and leaves all of his worldly possessions behind him to travel the world on this mission.\n\nHe goes to all corners of the globe counting grass blades.\n\nAfter 50 years, he comes back to the monastery.\nHe gives the monk accurate numbers and the monks give him monk-hood.\nAnd obviously, the first thing he wants to do is find out what that noise was. So he asks the head monk.\n\nThe head monk beckons him to follow him and he does.\nAfter a few minutes of walking through corridors and rooms, they happen upon a wooden door. \n\nThe man can hear the noise. He gets excited. The head monk hands him a brass key.\nHe reaches with the key to the lock, and unlocks the door.\n\nThere is another door though. This time iron. And the monk hands him an iron key.\n\nThis happens again and again.\nSo many types of doors and keys. Every thing you could imagine. Glass doors, gold doors. Everything\n\nFinally, they get to a door made of solid diamond. The noise is louder than ever. The monk hands the man the final key.\n\nHe opens the door and finally sees what has been making the noise.\n\nBut I can't tell you what it is, because you aren't a monk.",

But alas, as they approached, the giant once again kicked them all down the mountain.\n\nThe Trids were upset until they thought that perhaps the giant was Jewish. Unfortunately, no Trids were Jewish, so they asked a rabbi of a different community for help. The Rabbi led a group of Trids up the mountain. The giant saw them coming and kicked all of them, except for the Rabbi, down the mountain.

You haven\u2019t even asked for her ID!\u201d The bartender shrugs and says \u201cshe\u2019s clearly a gold digger.\u201d\n\n______\n\nA large block of ice walks into a bar and places his order. \u201cI\u2019ll take a whisky on the rocks, but don\u2019t serve my kids.\u201d\n\n______\n\nThe bartender walks into a doctor\u2019s office and says \u201csame punch line, different context.\u201d\n\u2026\n\n______\n\nTwo nuns walk into a bar. The first is elderly, and seems to be fully devout. The other is young, blonde, and appears to be new to the convent. \n \u201cBartender,\u201d says the elderly nun, \u201cI was wondering if you could settle a little dispute for us. You see, my trainee believes that true holiness can be achieved in a matter of days, rather than with the years on end that I\u2019ve been practicing. One year out of catholic school, and she thinks that she is as holy as me!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d replies the bartender, \u201cboth of your write down your arguments, and I\u2019ll decide who among you is most holy.\u201d\nThe sisters begin to write their cases. The elder nun finishes first, and slides her paper toward the bartender. At this point, the blonde sister has pulled out a calculator, and starts to plug away at the buttons.\nThe bartender reads the first paper aloud. \u201c\u2018Everyday, for the last 40 years, I\u2019ve woken at dawn for morning prayer. I prepare breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the entire convent, while using any spare hours for reading the texts and scripture. In case that isn\u2019t holy enough, I volunteer on the weekends.\u2019 Good gracious, sister!\u201d Says the bartender, \u201cthis is quite exemplary.\u201d \nBy now, the young nun has finished and has passed her paper to the bartender.\n\u201cAll this says is \u03c0r^2, r=2\u2026 Hold on, is this an equation for the area of a circle?!\u201d exclaims the bartender.\n\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d says the blonde, blushing.\n \u201cIt was supposed to be circumference.\u201d\n______\n\nA bartender has been going through a financial rough patch, and hoped that his wife would accommodate for the tough times by letting him try anal. Now, the wife resents her husband, and was appalled by his audacity to ask for such a thing with their marriage on the fritz. She denies his request.\nLater in the week, a man walks into the bar and asks the bartender for a prostitute. The bartender is about to send the man on his way, when he gets an idea that would make him some money while simultaneously punishing his wife.\n\u201cYou see that woman in the corner?\u201d He asks, \u201cWell, she\u2019s one of the best girls we got. You go over to her and take her into the private room. You can do whatever you want with her, no matter how much she resists. It\u2019s all part of the act. After you\u2019re through, come back here and pay full price, $2000.\u201d\nThe man nods his head excitedly in agreement and walks toward the wife. The bartender watches from afar as the two exchange a few quick words. All of a sudden, he sees the man grab his wife by the arm and pull her into the private room.\nThe bartender smiles inwardly to himself and thinks \u201cHa! That\u2019ll teach the bitch to appreciate me. Plus, I\u2019m making a small fortune!\u201d\nAfter about twenty minutes, the wife comes out, alone. She heads over to the bartender with a slight limp.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your new friend?\u201d asks the bartender, smiling. \u201cHe owes me a little money.\u201d\nThe wife snickers, pulls her husband in close and whispers in his ear \u201cI let him use the back door,\u201d and walks away.\n\n______\n\nA man walks into a bar and the bartender says \u201cNO. STOP. GET OUT OF HERE, THIS ISN\u2019T FUNNY ANY MORE.\u201d\n",

First, I want my engagement ring to be a 75-carat diamond ring with a matching 200-carat diamond tiara.\"\n\nThe African king pauses for awhile. Then, he nods his head and says, \"No problem! I have. I have.\"\n\nRealizing her first condition was too easy the woman says to the man, \"I want you to build me a 100-room mansion in New York. As a vacation home, I want a chateau built in the middle of the best wine country in France.\"\n\nThe king pauses for awhile. He whips out his cell phone and calls some brokers in New York and in France. He looks at the woman, nods his head and says, \"Okay, okay. I build. I build.\"\n\nRealizing that she only has one last condition, the secretary knows that she'd better make this a good one. She takes her time to think and finally she gets an idea. A sure-to-work condition. She squints her eyes, looks at the man and says, rather coldly, \"Since I like sex, I want the man I marry to have a 14-inch penis.\"\n\nThe man becomes distraught. He cups his face with his hands and rests his elbows on the table, all the while muttering to himself. Finally, the king shakes his head, looking really sad, and says to the woman, \"Okay, okay. I cut. I cut.\"",

They are over there, under that tree.\" \"Bring them along,\" the lawyer replied. Turning to the other poor man he stated, \"You come with us also.\" The second man, in a pitiful voice then said, \"But sir, I also have a wife and SIX children with me!\" \"Bring them all, as well,\" the lawyer answered. They all entered the car, which was no easy task, even for a car as large as the limousine. Once underway, one of the poor fellows turned to the lawyer and said, \"Sir, you are too kind. Thank you for taking all of us with you.\" The lawyer replied, \"Glad to do it. You'll really love my place; the grass is almost a foot high!\"",

The new law was that, in order to get into heaven, you had to have had a really bad day the day you died.\n\nSo the next day the first person came to the gates of heaven. The angel at the gate promptly asked the man to tell him about the day he died.\n\n\"Well, for some time now, I thought my wife was having an affair and that each day on her lunch hour she'd bring her lover home to our 25th floor apartment and have sex with him. So today I was going to come home too, and catch them. Well, I got there and busted in, and immediately began searching for this guy. My wife was half-naked and yelling at me as I searched the entire apartment. But, damn it, I couldn't find him! Just when I was about to give up, I happened to glance out onto the balcony and noticed that there was a man hanging off the edge by his fingertips ! The nerve of that guy to think he could hide from me! Well, I ran out there and promptly stomped on his fingers until he fell to the ground. But, wouldn't you know it, he landed in some bushes that broke his fall, and he didn't die. This got me even more enraged so I went back inside to get the first thing I could get my hands on to throw at him, which turned out to be the refrigerator. I unplugged it, pushed it out onto the balcony and heaved it over the side. It plummeted 25 stories and crushed him !\n\nThe excitement of the moment was so great that I had a heart attack and died almost instantly.\"\n\nThe angel sat back and thought for a moment.\n\nTechnically, the guy DID have a bad day. So he announced, \"OK, sir, welcome to the kingdom of heaven,\" and let him in. A few seconds later the next guy came up. \"OK, here's the rule. Before I can let you in, I need to hear about the day you died.\"\n\n\"Sure thing,\" the next man replied. \"But you're not going to believe this. I was out on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing my daily exercises when I got a little carried away and accidentally fell over the side! Luckily I was able to catch myself by my fingertips on the balcony directly beneath mine, when, all of a sudden, this crazy man came running out of his apartment and started cussing and stomping on my fingers! Well, of course I fell. I hit some trees and bushes on the way down which broke my fall so I didn't die right away. As I lay there face up on the ground, unable to move and in excruciating pain, I saw the man push his refrigerator, of all things, over the ledge and it fell directly on top of me and killed me ! \"\n\nThe angel is quietly laughing to himself as the man finishes his story. \"Very well, \" he announces. \"Welcome to the kingdom of heaven, \" and lets the man enter.\n\nA few seconds later a third man comes up to the gate. \"Tell me about the day you died,\" says the angel.\n\"OK, picture this,\" says the man. \"I'm naked inside a refrigerator. . . \"",

But, it did not last. A Hurricane came up unexpectedly. The ship went down almost instantly.\n\nThe man found himself, he knew not how, swept up on the shore of an island. There was nothing else anywhere to be seen. No people, no supplies, nothing. The man looked around. There were some bananas and coconuts, but that was it. He was desperate, and forlorn, but decided to make the best of it. So for the next four months he ate bananas, drank coconut juice and mostly looked to the sea mightily for a ship to come to his rescue.\n\nOne day, as he was lying on the beach stroking his beard and looking for a ship, he spotted movement out of the corner of his eye. Could it be true, was it a ship? No, from around the corner of the island came this row-boat. In it was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen, or at least seen in 4 months. She was tall, tanned, and her blond hair flowing in the sea breeze gave her an almost ethereal quality. She spotted him also as he was waving and yelling and screaming to get her attention. \n\nShe rowed her boat towards him. In disbelief, he asked, \"Where did you come from? How did you get here?\" \n\nShe said, \"I rowed from the other side of the island. I landed on this island when my cruise ship sank.\" \n\n\"Amazing\", he said, \"I didn't know anyone else had survived. How many of you are there? Where did you get the row-boat? You must have been really lucky to have a row-boat wash-up with you?\" \n\n\"It is only me\", she said, \"and the row-boat didn't wash up, nothing else did.\"\n\n\"Well then\", said the man, \"how did you get the row-boat?\" \n\n\"I made the row-boat out of raw material that I found on the island\", replied the woman. \"The oars were whittled from Gum tree branches, I wove the bottom from Palm branches, and the sides and stern came from a Eucalyptus tree\"\n\n\"But, but,\" asked the man, \"what about tools and hardware, how did you do that?\"\n\n\"Oh, no problem\", replied the woman, \"on the south side of the island there is a very unusual strata of alluvial rock exposed. I found that If I fired it to a certain temperature in my kiln, it melted into forgeable ductile iron. I used that for tools, and used the tools to make the hardware. But, enough of that,\" she continued. \"Where do you live?\" At last the man was forced to confess that he had been sleeping on the beach. \n\n\"Well, let's row over to my place\", she said. So they both got into the row-boat and left for her side of island. The woman easily rowed them around to a wharf that led to the approach to her place. She tied up the row-boat with a beautifully woven hemp rope. They walked up a stone walk and around a Palm tree, there stood an exquisite bungalow painted in blue and white.\n\n\"It's not much\", she said, \"but I call it home. Sit down please, would you like to have a drink?\" \n\n\"No\", said the man, \"one more coconut juice and I will puke.\"\n\n\"It won't be coconut juice\", the woman replied, \"I have a still, how about a Pina Colada?\" Trying to hide his continued amazement, the man accepted, and they sat down on her couch to talk. After a while, when they had exchanged their stories, the woman asked, \"Tell me, have you always had a beard?\" \n\n\"No\", the man replied, \"I was clean shaven all of my life, and even on the cruise ship.\"\n\n\"Well if you would like to shave, there is a man's razor upstairs in the cabinet in the bathroom.\" So, the man, no longer questioning anything, went upstairs to the bathroom. There in the cabinet was a razor made from a bone handle, two shells honed to a hollow ground edge were fastened on to its end inside of a swivel mechanism. The man shaved, showered and went back down stairs.\n\n\"You look great\", said the woman, \"I think I will go up and slip into something more comfortable.\" So she did. And, the man continued to sip his Pina Colada. After a short time, the woman returned - this time wearing fig leafs strategically positioned and smelling faintly of gardenia.\n\n\"Tell me\", she asked, \"we have both been out here for a very long time with no companionship. You know what I mean. Have you been lonely, is there anything that you really miss? Something that all men and women need? Something that it would be really nice to have right now?\"\n\n\"Yes there is,\" the man replied, as he moved closer to the woman while fixing a winsome gaze upon her, \"Tell me.

This is an actual account as relayed to paramedics at a chili cook-off in New Mexico. \n\n\nFor those of you who have lived in New Mexico, you know how true this is. They actually have a Chili Cook-off about the time Halloween comes around. It takes up a major portion of a parking lot at the Santa Fe Plaza. Judge #3 was an inexperienced Chili taster named Frank, who was visiting from Springfield, IL.\n\n\nFrank: \"Recently, I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table, asking for directions to the Coors Light truck, when the call came in... I was assured by the other two judges (Native New Mexicans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy; and, besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted and became Judge 3.\"\n\n\nHere are the scorecard notes from the event:\n\n\n\nCHILI # 1 - MIKE'S MANIAC MONSTER CHILE\n\nJudge # 1 -- A little too heavy on the tomato. Amusing kick.\n\nJudge # 2 -- Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.\n\nJudge # 3 (Frank) -- Holy crap, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. It took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These New Mexicans are crazy.\n\n\n\nCHILE # 2 - EL RANCHO'S AFTERBURNER CHILE\n\nJudge # 1 -- Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang..\n\nJudge # 2 -- Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.\n\nJudge # 3 -- Keep this out of the reach of children. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.\n\n\n\nCHILI # 3 - ALFREDO'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI\n\nJudge # 1 -- Excellent firehouse chile. Great kick.\n\nJudge # 2 -- A bit salty, good use of peppers.\n\nJudge # 3 -- Call the EPA. I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting ****-faced from all of the beer.\n\n\n\nCHILI # 4 - BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC\n\nJudge # 1 -- Black bean chile with almost no spice. Disappointing.\n\nJudge # 2 -- Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chile.\n\nJudge # 3 -- I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out taste buds? Sally, the beer maid, was standing behind me with fresh refills. This 300 lb. woman is starting to look HOT ... just like this nuclear waste I'm eating! Is chili an aphrodisiac?\n\n\n\nCHILE # 5 - LISA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER\n\nJudge # 1 -- Meaty, strong chili. Jalapeno peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.\n\nJudge # 2 -- Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the jalapeno peppers make a strong statement.\n\nJudge # 3 -- My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted, and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from the pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off. It really ticks me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw them.\n\n\n\nCHILE # 6 - VARGA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY\n\nJudge # 1 -- Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spices and peppers.\n\nJudge # 2 -- The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, garlic. Superb.\n\nJudge # 3 -- My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I crapped on myself when I farted, and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that Sally. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my butt with a snow cone.\n\n\n\nCHILE # 7 - SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI\n\nJudge # 1 -- A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.\n\nJudge # 2 -- Ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. **I should take note that I am worried about judge number 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.\n\nJudge # 3 -- You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava to match my shirt. At least during the autopsy, they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing. It's too painful. I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.\n\n\n\nCHILE # 8 - BIG TOM'S TOENAIL CURLING CHILE\n\nJudge # 1 -- The perfect ending, this is a nice\nblend chile. Not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.\n\nJudge # 2 -- This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge #3 farted, passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor feller, wonder how he'd have reacted to really hot chili?\n\nJudge # 3 - No Report.",

The urn was all dusty and dented and cracked and bent and generally broken. However, Benny decided to rub the urn with his sleeve, thinking he might be able to get a few coins out of it. But suddenly, out of the urn came a Genie!\n\nThe genie stretched and yawned and said: \"Oh! Thank you! Thank you so much! I can't tell you how long I've been in that urn! You're a lucky man, fella. Very lucky.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said Benny.\n\n\"Because you've got wishes coming your way, friend. Three, to be exact.\"\n\nSo Benny thought for a while and said, \"Ok, I want some new threads.\" And thus he got a fancy toga. And then he said \"I could use a new house.\" And a fancy mansion made of fine marble popped up.\n\nFinally, Benny said: \"And, for my final wish, I'd like to be immortal. I wanna live forever.\"\n\nThe genie was taken back a bit and thought for a while: \"Well, that's, um, that's a bit of an expensive wish, you see. Hm. Tell you what. I'll make you immortal, but on one condition. You can never, ever, shave your beard or cut your hair. If you do, you're gonna get sucked into an urn. That's how I ended up like this. Deal?\"\n\n\"Deal,\" said Benny.\n\nSo the Genie granted his wish and Benny began wandering the world. He saw Rome rise and fall, the Dark Ages get lighter, the New World grow and prosper. He went all over the planet, from China to Germany to Canada to Brazil. But all this time, Benny had never fallen in love.\n\nBut one day, Benny came across a beautiful woman on the beach. He walked up to her and introduced himself. And as the woman brushed the hair out of his face they gazed into each other's eyes, and it was love at first sight. They danced and they laughed and they sung, and it was a happy time for both of them.\n\nOne day, on the same beach they had met on, Benny got down on one knee and asked the woman to marry him. The woman thought for a while.\n\n\"Benny,\" she said, \"I'll marry you. But only if you shave your beard and cut your hair. It's long and dirty and full of rats, and whenever we go to see a movie it takes up eight seats.\"\n\nBenny sat down and mulled this over. The Genie and the urn were long gone, he thought. Who would notice if he cut his hair and shaved his beard. He happily agreed, and went to the pharmacy and bought 400 disposable razors and 25 cans of shaving cream.\n\nHe went into the bathroom, and waved to his girlfriend, saying he'd be out in a bit. You could hear the *chic, chic* of the razor and the *pst, pst* of the shaving cream. Then suddenly, it all went quiet.\n\nHis girlfriend, after a while, knocked on the door. *Tap tap* \"Benny?\" *Tap Tap* \"Benny?!\" *TAP TAP* \"BENNY?!?\"\n\nFinally she pushed open the door, and on the ground lay around 8 cubic yards of hair, and an urn.\n\nSo, there's a moral to this story.\n\nAnd that moral is, a Benny shaved, is a Benny urned.",

About two weeks later, his son, who they had been very attached to after the miscarriage, had walked out into traffic, and was struck and killed by a car. Then blame starts to get thrown around. His wife leaves him, taking the house and all of his money and possessions that he had worked hard for, and she started having sex with a body builder. Barry was devastated, financially and emotionally. He contemplated suicide. But no, he decided that to bring excitement back into his life, he would rob a train.\n\nHe gets his revolver, and heads onto a train. When the ticket taker comes around to take his ticket, he pulls out the gun. \"Nobody move or you get shot!\" he shouted. People complied with him. He took everyone's money. It had worked, he finally had some excitement in his life again. He was so happy, that he didn't even notice the police coming on board to arrest him. The police asked him why he did it and he said, \"I don't know, it all just started going downhill. My whole life was ruined. I honestly thought in the back of my mind that it could bring my son back.\" \"That's a very weird reason,\" the cop replied, and put him in the police car.\n\nHe was in jail, miserable that he was no longer excited. Then the other guy in the cell asked him, \"What you in for?\" \"I robbed a train,\" Barry replied. The man replied, \"Why'd ya do it?\" \"I wanted some excitement in my life. I don't know, I thought it might bring my son back,\" Barry replied. \"That's a pretty strange cause, eh?\" \"Yeah.\"\n\nBarry was meeting with his lawyer to discuss how they should take this case. \"Well, did you do it?\" his lawyer asked. \"Yeah,\" Barry replied. \"Why?\" \"I don't know. I needed some excitement in my life, and I guess I thought it would bring my son back.\" His lawyer was dumbfounded, but managed to say, \"That's a peculiar impetus, don't you think?\" \"Uh-huh,\" Barry said back.\n\nBarry finally got to his court day. He knew he was going to plead guilty, he had to. \"All rise for the honorable judge Wilson presiding.\" The judge came in, and everyone took their seats. The judge looks at Barry, then at his papers, and says, \"It states here that you robbed a train, because you needed excitement in your life and you thought it would bring you son back.\" \n\nAnd Barry replied, \"It was a loco motive.\"",

Yes, it's a pretty nice place. No, its not perfect, but its close. You see the only problem are the ducks. If you step on a duck it will begin to quack and then all the other ducks will begin to quack and its simply a nuisance for us all.\" Saint Peter replied.\n\nThe three men looked at each other, shrugged, and entered heaven. As far as the eye could see there were ducks everywhere. Almost immediately one of the men accidentally stepped on a duck. Just as Peter had said, the duck began to quack and then the ducks around him began an audible tidal wave of quacks. \n\nSoon after the quacks had passed, Saint Peter approached the men in hand with a hag of a woman. Without a word, he shackled the hag to the man that stepped on the duck and left.\n\nThe other two men were careful not to step on a duck. Although they tried there best, one of them eventually stepped on a duck. The same phenomenon of before arose and Saint Peter arrived again with a huge amazonian woman. He shackled the woman to the man and left.\n\nThe final man treaded with care and spent many days and nights successfully stepping around the ducks. After a while, Saint Peter approached the man with a beautiful woman. He shackled the woman to the man and left without a word.\n\nThe man was so delighted he audibly said to himself, \"What did I do to deserve this?\"\n\nThe woman replied, \"I don't know, but I stepped on a duck.\"",

The professor thought this over and told them they could make up the final on the following day.  The two guys were elated and relieved. They studied that night and went in the next day for the final.\n\nThe professor placed them in separate rooms, and handed each of them a test booklet and told them to begin.

So to prevent this, he visited the local sex shop in order to buy his wife a vibrator to keep her occupied in his absence.\n\n\nAfter examining the products, he hadn't found an appropriately amazing vibrator and asked the store clerk for help. The store clerk recommended the \"Voodoo Dick.\"\n\"How does it work?\" asked the businessman.\n\n\nThe clerk unwrapped the Voodoo Dick from its ceremonial tiki box and said to it, \"Voodoo Dick that door.\" The vibrator flew out of the box and attacked the door with such vigor that the door split in half.\n\n\n\"Fantastic,\" said the man. \"I'll take it!\"\n\n\nHe instructed his wife on how to use the Voodoo Dick and left on his business trip. Soon, his wife decided to try it out and said the magic words: \"Voodoo Dick my pussy.\"\nThe Voodoo Dick flew out of the box and gave her orgasm after orgasm. But soon it became too much, and she couldn't figure out how to make it stop. So she got into her car and began driving to the hospital, swerving so much that she got pulled over by the police. The policeman asked her why she was driving so recklessly and she explained to him that she had a Voodoo Dick inside her that wouldn't leave her alone.\nThe policeman looked at her skeptically and said, \"Voodoo Dick, my ass.\"",

So I guess Country Mild tastes like dirt with shit in it, although not as much shit as some of the stronger varieties.\n\nBut now that I think about it, most people are from the city and only see the country through popular media, so I suppose it's more reasonable to assume the sausage was seasoned based on Hollywood's interpretation of the country.\n\nIt could be based on some of the more historical fictions of the old west or perhaps a documentary, but then it'd have to taste like pain and hard work.\n\nOr perhaps it's based on the more popular Clint Eastwood style western, then it'd taste like death and loneliness.\n\nBut a younger audience couldn't identify with either of those themes. It'd have to be something more recent, more progressive, something that changed the way people viewed the west.\n\nThen it hit me, Brokeback Mountain.\n\nNot only did the movie rewrite the identity of country western culture, but it's also the perfect euphemism for Country Sausage.\n\nAgain, this made me wonder what the 'Mild' referred to, but after a great deal of deliberation I've arrived at the only viable conclusion.\n\nCountry Mild Sausage tastes like the first few minutes of gay sex; you know the part where where his dick isn't covered in shit yet, but you can still taste it?\n\nIt seems my original guess wasn't too far off.",

        "body": "TL;DR monkey poo makes great pudding. \n\nIn the mid 1950s the New York philharmonic was one of the best Symphony Orchestras in the world. And conducting was Major Jorge Fillmore. George Fillmore was a WWII vet who loved music, and found that conducting helped him keep his PTSD at a minimum (although PTSD had yet to be understood by the medical community, let alone given a name). The flow of the notes soothed his soul and the power of conducting such a large group to produce something so beautiful reminded him of his time commanding his troops through the dangers of war. \n\nOn a cold December night, the New York Philharmonic was warming up for their Christmas performance. The upper class from all around poured into Carnegie Hall and greeted one another. Conductor Fillmore got ready in the back room and the orchestra was out on stage, behind the curtain, getting ready to play, and practicing their most difficult runs. \n\nThen when the time came and everyone was seated, the first chair violinist came on stage to much applause. He tuned the orchestra and then out came Major George Fillmore, his coat tails flowing behind him like curtains in the brease, as he walked briskly to the podium. He turned and bowed deeply to the audience and then addressed the orchestra and motioned to start the first piece. The audience well acquainted with these pieces sat quietly, enjoying the soft notes of Mozart as they floated through the hall. \n\nBut as quickly as everyone had relaxed to the music, they were pulled from their stuppor by a loud gunshot. Then screaming. The orchestra all scrambled for the exits, trying to keep their instruments safe. As the smoke settled and everyone calmed down, they found a dead French horn player, and the smoking gun in the hand of none other than Major George Fillmore. The French horn player had flubbed a note in his solo and Major Fillmore had snapped and shot him. \n\nMajor Fillmore claimed that he thought the player was wearing something that resembled a swastika and had triggered a flash back and caused him to shoot the player. But the orchestra knew that he had been yelling at that particular horn player for several weeks when he had been unable to play the solo properly. In the following weeks, a large and publicized trial was held. Fillmore was stripped of his rank and sentenced to death by electric chair. \n\nFollowing the trial, George was held in prison for several years as he tried to appeal and at least lessen his sentence but unfortunately after lots of trying, the day came that he was to be killed. As a kindness to those about to die, the prison allowed the prisoners to request anything to eat, within reason. As it was this time for George, they asked him what he would like for his last meal. \n\n\"well,\" said George, \"I like bananas... So I guess I guess I would love a bunch of bananas.\" \nSo they brought him a bunch of bananas. And within an hour he had eaten every single banana in the bunch, and with that, he was lead to the chair. They strapped him in and connected all the leads, and after saying his final farewells, they threw the switch. The first pulse of electricity was used to kill the brain and make the victim unconscious. Then a second pulse is used to cause the internal organs to fail. However, George was barely phased by the first pulse, and then started to convulse slowly during the second phase. Then everything fell quiet. \n\n\"Was that it?\" asked George. \n\n\"Umm.. That's a first.\" said one of the scientists that had helped develop the chair. \n\nThey decided to put George back in prison while they made a few modifications to the chair. They decided to pull more power from the grid and just pump more juice to the chair. Hopefully this would at least kill him, but it could be more painful. Once the modifications had been made, they brought George back. \n\n\nThe prison warden had some pity for him, so he allowed him to have a second last meal. When asked what he wanted to eat, George said that he loved the bananas he had had before, this time he would like two bunches of bananas. \n\nSure enough within the hour, George had eaten both bunches of bananas, and was lead right back to that chair. They strapped him in again and threw the switch. When the first pulse hit him he clearly went unconscious, and all the lights in the surrounding city block dimmed noticably. And then during the second pulse, the current and voltage was so strong that lightning covered most of his torso, arcing from the helmet to the back plate to his arm rests. \n\nWhen the pulse was over, they pulled him from the chair and laid him on a gurney and they rolled him down the hallway toward the morgue. As they reached the morgue, suddenly George sat upright. He looked around and let loose a howling scream that was unlike any sound the doctors had ever heard. He then fell back to the gurney but kept breathing. \n\nSeveral hours later, he woke up again and was perfectly fine. The scientists, puzzled, decided that they really needed to finish him off once and for all. They had the electricity from all the surrounding towns, re routed to the chair. There was more power going to this chair than the Las Vegas Strip. Sure that this time they would kill him, they brought him back from the hospital, and gave him what they were sure would actually be his last meal. \n\n\nAgain, curiously, he ordered bananas. But he ordered 3 bunches this time. And as with the last two times, he ate every single banana within an hour. They brought him in and strapped him in, and flipped the switch. This time lightning erupted from George and the chair, arcing across the room like a massive tesla coil. The man who flipped the switch, not realizing the danger, had been struck dead by the massive arcs and everyone else stood cowering in the viewing room waiting for it all to be over. \n\nOnce it was over, they carefully pulled him from the chair, his hair singed off and second and third degree burns all over his body. They carried him down to the morgue where they double checked that he was dead. But alas. His heart was still beating. The scientists, determined to find out how he had survived, asked that he be nursed back to health so that they could ask him how he had survived. \n\nAfter several months, George Fillmore came out of his coma, and the scientists all gathered around and asked him,\n\n\"How did you survive the chair three times?!\"\n\n\"well,\" said George, \"I guess I'm just a bad conductor.\"",

To his horror he caught his son with his dick out jerking it like a madman. The farmer covered his face and walked away. His son came over a while later and the farmer said \"Son, you really need to get laid. You're like 16. Here take our prize winning duck into town to see if you can trade a pretty lady for some sexing.\"\n\n The son agreed and took the duck into town. First, he asked some lady alongside the road if she would sex him up in exchange for his bird. She punched him in the mouth. This happened several times with bodily injury always being the result. Finally, the son staggered into a laudromat a few miles from home and saw a pretty lady doing some laundry.\n\nHe asked, \"Excuse me miss, would be willing to have sex with me in exchange for this duck?\" The duck quacked. The woman was at first angry and about to punch him but realized that times were tough and that was one bitching looking bird. So she agreed and took him into the back room of the laundromat. \n\nThe two of them proceeded to have sex and the now dazed son gave her the duck, per the prior agreement. When handed the duck, she hesitated and said \"Hey, how about I trade you this duck back and we go have sex again?\" The son gasps and flails and takes his bird back and sprints with the woman to bump uglies for a second time. \n\nThe woman is happy and sends the son home with her address and phone number. The dazed and foggy son takes his prized waterfowl directly out of the laundromat and is promptly run over by a truck. Luckily, he is ok but the duck is smashed and killed. The driver hops out and says \"Gee, I sure am sorry. That seemed like a nice duck. Here is 50 cents to help you buy a new one\". \n\nThe boy happily accepts the money since it is a huge amount for that period and walks merrily home. \n\nUpon arriving the farmer sees his happy son in the setting dusk and asks him \"Well son, how was your day?\"\n\n\nThe son smiles enormously and says\n\n\"Well dad, I gave a duck for a fuck. Got a fuck for a duck, and got half a buck for a fucked up duck.\"\n\nEdit: Took off the tl;dr, not needed",

The choice is clear here.\n\n- *Chi-chi.*\n\nThe chief turns around to the crowd and announces:\n\n- *CHI-CHI!*\n\nThe crowd erupts cheering and yelling! They untie the soldier, strip him off his clothes, tie him up face down to a log on the ground and every warrior in the village fucks him in the ass until they come. After this is done, they untie the soldier, give him back his clothes and send him on his way, free.\n\nThe chief then walks up to the captain and asks him:\n\n- *You must choose. Chi-chi, or death!*\n\nThe captain defiantly looks at the chief in the eyes and says:\n\n- *I choose death!*\n\nThe chief turns around to the crowd and announces:\n\n- *DEATH!*\n\nThe crowd, disappointed, starts booing loudly. The chief then says:\n\n- *...BUT BEFORE, CHI-CHI!*",

        "body": "We've all been there but don't like to admit it. We've all kicked back in our cubicles and suddenly felt something brew down below. As much as we try to convince ourselves otherwise, the WORK POOP is inevitable. For those who hate pooping at work, following is the 2013 Survival Guide for taking a dump at work. Memorize these definitions and pooping at work will become a pure pleasure. \n\nESCAPEE.\nDefinition: a fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of panic embarrassment. This is similar to the hot flash you receive when passing an unseen police car and speeding. If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you are standing next to the farter in the urinal, pretend you did not hear it. No one likes an escapee, it is uncomfortable for all involved. Making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel uneasy. \n\nJAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with ESCAPEE).\nDefinition: When forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine gun pace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should happen, do not panic. Remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred. \n\nCOURTESY FLUSH.\nDefinition: The act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of the poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed location. This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom. This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME. \n\nWALK OF SHAME.\nDefinition: Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you have just stunk up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks in and busts you. As with all farts, it is best to pretend that the smell does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of the COURTESY FLUSH. \n\nOUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER.\nDefinition: A colleague who poops at work and damn proud of it. You will often see an Out Of The Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with a newspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look around the office for the Out Of The Closet Pooper before entering the bathroom. \n\nTHE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN).\nDefinition: A group of coworkers who band together to ensure emergency pooping goes off without incident. This group can help you to monitor the whereabouts of Out Of The Closet Poopers, and identify SAFE HAVENS. \n\nSAFE HAVENS.\nDefinition: A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom. \n\nTURD BURGLAR:\nDefinition: A pooper who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments that can occur when taking a dump at work. If this occurs, remain in the stall until the Turd Burglar leaves. This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact. \n\nCAMO-COUGH.\nDefinition: A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON, or to alert potential Turd Burglars. Very effective when used in conjunction with an ASTAIRE. \n\nASTAIRE.\nDefinition: A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential Turd Burglars that you are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that the stall is occupied. If you hear an Astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace. \n\nWATERMELON.\nDefinition: A turd that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water. This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a Watermelon coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH. \n\nHAVANA OMELET.\nDefinition: A load of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water. Often accompanied by an Escapee. Try using a Camo-Cough with an Astaire. \n\nUNCLE TED.\nDefinition: A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever. Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot. An Uncle Ted makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, as you should always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees. \n\nFLY BY.\nDefinition: The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in and check for other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and come back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER. People may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.",

We seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so we're not sure what to do with you.\"\n\n\"No problem, just let me in,\" says the Senator.\n\n\"Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from the higher ups.

They run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the\nexpense of the people.\n\nThey played a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster, caviar and the finest champagne.\n\nAlso present is the devil, who really is a very friendly guy who is having a good time dancing and telling jokes.\n\nThey are all having such a good time that before the Senator realizes it, it is time to go.\n\nEveryone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises.\n\nThe elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens in heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him, \"Now it's time to visit heaven.\u201d\n\nSo, 24 hours passed with the Senator joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing.

Now choose your eternity.\"\n\nThe Senator reflects for a minute, then he answers: \"Well, I would never have said it before, I mean heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better off in hell.\"\n\nSo St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell...\n\nNow the doors of the elevator open and he's in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage.

She overheard the guys talking about their golf round. She said, \"You know, I used to play on my golf team in college and I was pretty good. Would you mind if I joined you next week?\"\n \nThe three guys looked at each other. Not one of them wanted to say 'yes', but she had them on the spot. Finally, one man said it would be okay, but they would be starting early - at 6:30 a.m.\n \n\nHe figured the early tee-time would discourage her. The woman said this may be a problem, and asked if she could be up to 15 minutes late. They rolled their eyes, but said okay. She smiled and said, \"Good, I'll be there at 6:30 or 6:45.\"\n \n\nShe showed up at 6:30 sharp, and beat all three of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round. She was fun and a pleasant person, and the guys were impressed. Back at the clubhouse, they congratulated her and invited her back the next week. She smiled, and said, \"I'll be there at 6:30 or 6:45.\"\n \nThe next week she again showed up at 6:30 sharp. Only this time, she played left-handed. The three guys were incredulous as she still beat them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand. They were totally amazed.\n \n\nThey couldn't figure her out. She was again very pleasant and didn't seem to be purposely showing them up. They invited her back again, but each man harbored a burning desire to beat her.\n \nThe third week, the guys had their game faces on. But this time, she was 15 minutes late, which made the guys irritable. This week the lady played right-handed, and narrowly beat all three of them.\n \n\nThe men mused that her late arrival was due to petty gamesmanship on her part. However, she was so gracious and so complimentary of their strong play, they couldn't hold a grudge.\nBack in the clubhouse, all three guys were shaking their heads. This woman was a riddle no one could figure out. They had a couple of beers, and finally, one of the men asked her point blank, \"How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?\"\n \n\nThe lady blushed, and grinned. \"That's easy,\" she said. \"When my Dad taught me to play golf, I learned I was ambidextrous. I like to switch back and forth. When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Before I left in the morning for golf practice, I would pull the covers off him. If his unit was pointing to the right, I played right-handed; if it was pointed to the left, I played left-handed.\"\n \n\nThe guys on the team thought this was hysterical. Astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys shot back, \"But what if it's pointing straight up?\"\n \nShe said, \"Then, I'm fifteen minutes late.\" \n",

What do you say to that?\"\n\nThe heron replied, \"Dijeron!\"\n\nIn case you don't get it, it's a triple multilingual pun. See, dijeron is a past tense \"we\" or \"they\" form conjugation (although only the \"we\" form is considered in this joke) of the Spanish word \"decir\", meaning \"to say\". The \"j\" is pronounced like the English \"h\". So the heron says \"dijeron\", which sounds like \"the heron\", which is a pun in English because he's a heron. It's also a pun in Spanish because the heron's pretty much saying \"We said!\", which is kind of like \"Say!\", in reply to my \"what do you say to that?\", so it's also a pun in Spanish. Also, it's a pun in French since \"to say\" sounds a bit like \"touche\", a French word, which pretty much translates to \"good comeback\" or \"good point\". So the heron's acknowledging that my being able to exterminate his species was a pretty good point, and that it shouldn't be laughing at me. So in conclusion, it's a pun in:\n\nEnglish\nSpanish\nand French.\n\nYeah. I came up with this at two a.m. last night.",

A real challenge would be to preach to a bear.\nOne thing led to another and they decided to do an experiment. They would all go out into the woods, find a bear, preach to it, and attempt to convert it.\n\n\nSeven days later, they're all together to discuss the experience.\nFather Flannery, who has his arm in a sling, is on crutches, and has various bandages, goes first. \n\n\"Well,\" he says, \"I went into the woods to find me a bear. And when I found him I began to read to him from the Catechism. Well, that bear wanted nothing to do with me and began to slap me around. So I quickly grabbed my holy water, sprinkled him and, Mary Mother of God, he became as gentle as a lamb. The bishop is coming out next week to give him first communion and confirmation.\"\n\n\nReverend Billy Bob spoke next. He was in a wheelchair, with an arm and both legs in casts, and an IV drip. In his best fire and brimstone oratory he claimed, \n\n\"WELL brothers, you KNOW that we don't sprinkle! I went out and I FOUND me a bear. And then I began to read to my bear from God's HOLY WORD! But that bear wanted nothing to do with me. So I took HOLD of him and we began to wrestle. We wrestled down one hill, UP another and DOWN another until we came to a creek. So I quickly DUNKED him and BAPTIZED his hairy soul. And just like you said, he became as gentle as a lamb. We spent the rest of the day praising Jesus.\"\n\n\nThey both looked down at the rabbi, who was lying in a hospital bed. He was in a body cast and traction with IV's and monitors running in and out of him. All in all, he was in horrible shape.

He went on the vehicle and payed for the ride. But the driver seemed a little strange and the seats were filled with old people and people who seemed to be on the edge of overdosing something. Jayden sat down. As time passed jayden sensed that something was wrong and he started to freak out. 'I need to get of this bus! I'm..i'm not DEAD dude!' Jayden said while flailing his arms like a turtle on his back. Then he felt a cold hand touching him and heard an voice saying. 'Dude, ring the freakin bell.'",

        "body": "A world-famous and very dignified surgeon called a plumber to fix the flooded bathroom in his office.\n\nWhen the plumber arrived, he was carrying an extra set of used overalls. The dapper, impeccably groomed and expensively dressed doctor smirked in a condescending way and said: \"Do you usually need a change of overalls?!\"\n\nThe plumber just smiled. When he was done, the plumber gave him the bill and told him he had to get some more equipment from his truck.\n\nHe explained that he needed a new assistant because of all the work and was short-handed. He asked the surgeon if he knew of any friends who might want the job.\n\nThe surgeon raised his eyebrows and pointed at his suit, his shoes, his degree and his office: \"I'm well known in my field around the world! I am a surgeon. Now, do I look like someone who would have a plumber for a friend?\"\n\n\"You're right. A high class guy like you in a fancy suit and those shined up shoes would never know plumbers,\" said the plumber apologetically. He put the overalls down on a chair. \"I'm very sorry.\"\n\n\"I am on my way to give a presentation to the College of Surgeons! I'm sure I won't be meeting any plumbers there! I do not count plumbers among my friends!\" smirked the upper-crust doctor, as he checked his shoes to make sure the shine was still perfect and carefully tightened the knot of his tie. \"Now I suggest you get to work!\"\n\n\"YES SIR!\" said the plumber. It seemed the right thing to do to call the eminent surgeon \"Sir!\" \"I won't forget! I'm sorry sir!\"\n\nWhen the plumber returned, he entered the surgeon's office, stopped and stared. There on the floor were the doctor's brand new mirror-polished $1,000 handmade Italian leather shoes - but their owner's feet were no longer in them.\n\nA few feet away, he saw the doctor's black silk socks. \n\nBut the surgeon's feet were not inside those either.\n\nThe plumber grinned and followed the trail:\n\nNext he found the hand-tailored $2,000 Armani pinstriped business suit that the doctor had been wearing, also neatly folded, with attached paisley braces.\n\nThen he found the natty Hermes silk tie and the matching pocket square tossed on the floor.\n\nAfter that he saw the monogrammed gold cufflinks, starched white shirt, silver tiepin and Rolex - in a trail across the floor into the bathroom.\n\nThe surgeon's medical degree and briefcase were piled up next to them.\n\nThe plumber laughed and picked up the doctor's very expensive shoes and socks and his silk tie and his beautiful Italian suit and went in to the bathroom.\n\nThere was the world-famous surgeon - wearing the overalls, lying under the sink with his bare feet sticking out in an extremely undignified way.\n\nThe plumber tapped on the soles of the formerly dapper doctor's feet with his own high-class shoes.\n\nThe surgeon looked out, with sweat streaming down his hundred dollar haircut.\n\nThe plumber grinned. He said \"What is the world famous surgeon doing under the sink! Your shoes, your socks and your tie sir!\"\n\nThe surgeon grabbed his silk socks and wiped the sweat off his face with them. He blew his nose in his silk tie.\n\nHe took his very expensive shoes and tossed them one at a time into the trash.\n\nHe grabbed his Armani suit jacket and tied it around the leaky pipe. He took the suit trousers and ripped them down the middle.\n\nHe pointed at the plumber's bill and said \"Sir, You found your assistant.\"",

        "body": "The Boy was due to meet his friends down the third alley from the green sign.  The bar at the end of that alley, they had said, was a place where spirits and souls mixed together with the languid flow of warm summer air.\n\nBut The Boy had started drinking when the sun was still ascending, and now it was dark, very dark, and he wasn't sure whether he had turned down the third alley, or the fourth.  Or maybe the fifth.  The second?\n\nBut he could see dim light flickering at the end of the alley, past the shrouded grey cobblestones and the hulking black dumpsters, and with the light headed optimism of the young and intoxicated he was quite sure that he was heading in the right direction.\n\nHe moved towards the light, and when he was 20 paces away he saw it to be a single small window, glassless, spilling a dry and irregular orange glow out into the gloom.\n\nHis body had started to slow before his brain had time to think.  A dull feeling of *wrongness* crept into the night air, mixed with the bitter tang that seeped out of the dumpsters into the warm air around him.\n\nWithout willing it, his breath became quieter, his footsteps lighter, his approach more cautious.  But he kept moving forward.\n\nHe found himself drawn to the window, and such was the compulsion that it seemed to The Boy like he was standing still and the window was floating towards him.  Like the distance was being closed whether The Boy wanted it to or not.\n\nHe watched, detached from his own movements, as he came silently in front of the opening.  His eyes pinched for a second against the glare of the quietly thrumming lantern that illuminated the room, then the soft pain behind his eyes receded and he began to make sense of what he was seeing.\n\nThe window opened into a single small room that was cluttered with an incomprehensible multitude of instruments, many of them of bronze and leather, and all of them of a variety of shapes and sizes that seemed recognisably functional but otherwise alien.\n\nThe instruments were arranged in orderly rows along the walls, but were so great in number that they also accumulated in disorganised piles around the periphery of the space.\n\nIn the middle of the room was a square wooden table, and hunched over the table was a small figure.\n\nThe figure was facing diagonally away from The Boy, and The Boy could only make out a weathered grey overcoat and the flickering suggestion of the wizened profile of a wrinkled old man.\n\nThe figure was absolutely ensconced in whatever he was doing, and The Boy found himself irresistibly drawn to the windowsill as he squinted and craned, trying to see what the figure was doing.\n\nThe Boy barely breathed in the warm night air.  Everything was quiet.\n\nThe Boy watched as the figure lifted a coiled silver spring from the table and held it up to the lantern light.  The figure methodically pulled a pair of pliers from the wall and pinched it to one end of the spring.  With a slow, fluid motion, he pulled on the end of the spring with the pliers and drew the spring out until it was almost an arm's length. The coils unfurled smoothly and silently.\n\nThe figure lifted a square white cloth from the table and began to run it along the length of the uncoiled spring.  The figure's motions were slow, almost loving, as he drew the cloth back and forth across the shimmering wire.\n\nAfter some time, the figure drew another tool, a simple metal shaft with an indecipherable inscription along its length, and began to coil the spring back around it.  All of this was undertaken with an unhurried but incredibly focused fluidity that suggested true artisanal mastery.\n\nWhen the spring had been returned to a tight coil, the figure lay it gently on the table, and picked up a second, smaller spring.  He reached slowly for a different set of pliers and then paused.  His back straightened imperceptibly and he stopped.  The air stopped moving around him.  The Boy's breathing stopped.  Time stopped.\n\nThe figure began to turn towards the boy with what seemed like the speed of an hour hand on a watch face.  The lantern light flickered across the figure's profile and The Boy saw on that leathered face the deeply etched lines of Time so heavy that it filled The Boy with empty fear.\n\nThe figure turned completely to The Boy and The Boy was consumed by two huge black pupils, enlarged into grotesque caricature by a thick pair of gold-rimmed spectacles.\n\nThe figure assessed The Boy silently, and after several eternal seconds The Boy found some remnants of his voice and managed to speak.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" asked The Boy.\n\nThe figure's mouth creaked open, his tongue sliding across his top lip like an inquisitive worm testing out the outdoor air.\n\nThe figure spoke.\n\n\"Just some spring cleaning\"",

The\nguys were excited and relieved. They studied that night for the exam.\n\nThe next day the Professor placed them in separate rooms and gave them a test booklet.

One day, a construction crew turned up to start building a house on the empty lot.\n\nThe young family's 4-year-old daughter naturally took an interest in all the activity going on next door and spent much of each day observing the workers. Eventually the construction crew, all of them \"gems-in-the-rough,\" more or less, adopted her as a kind of project mascot. They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch breaks, and gave her 20 little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important.\n \nAt the end of the first week, they even presented her with a pay envelope containing ten dollars. The little girl took this home to her mother who suggested that she take her ten dollars \"pay\" she'd received to the bank the next day to start a savings account.\n\nWhen the girl and her mom got to the bank, the teller was equally impressed and asked the little girl how she had come by her very own pay check at such a young age.

I told the woman that I was very sorry, but I would have to go home and come back later.\n\nThe woman said, 'Unbutton your shirt'. So I opened my shirt revealing my curly silver hair.\n\nShe said, 'That silver hair on your chest is proof enough for me' and she processed my Social Security application.\n\nWhen I got home, I excitedly told my wife about my experience at the Social Security office.\n\nShe said, 'You should have dropped your pants.

What the poor potato lad doesn't know is that this tomato has a boyfriend, and her boyfriend is the leader of a local gang of thug-carrots.

Someone calls for 911, knowing there's going to be trouble. The thug-carrots lay into the poor potato, beating him senseless. They beat him within an inch of his life. An ambulance roars into the parking lot and the thugs flee from the scene, leaving the poor potato hanging barely onto his life.

        "body": "During the days when Native Americans were being forcibly and systematically removed from their ancestral lands, a small band of Cherokee had managed to elude the U.S. cavalry by using secret refuges in the Appalachian mountains. The only advantages they had were a particularly brutal winter that made navigating the mountains impossible for anyone without an intimate knowledge of them, and the brilliant leadership of their cunning war chief, Black Wolf. \n\nNow Black Wolf was getting on in years, and he had never married or had any offspring. He knew the time was coming for him to name a successor, and his intended candidate was his nephew: Falling Rocks, so called because of the way he would fall on the enemy with the fury of a rock slide. However, the other members of the tribe would think that he favored Falling Rocks due to his kinship, rather than merit. Some in the tribe would rather he name another brave, Tall Bear, to be the new war chief. Tall Bear was perhaps the mightiest warrior in the tribe, but he was brash and impulsive-- he had no mind for strategy, and won his battles on brute force alone. Falling Rocks, however, was a tactician and leader. He knew when to fight, when to flee, and when to try diplomacy. Black Wolf knew that the future of his tribe depended on more than merely being a skilled warrior. \n\nTo reconcile the two sides, Black Wolf announced that the new war chief would be decided by a test, and invited all who were interested to participate. Seven braves met him atop a rocky peak, just as the spring thaw began to open the mountain routes.\n\n\"This is a test to determine who shall be the new war chief,\" Black Wolf addressed the assembled warriors, \"You will walk in the direction of the setting sun, and return. Whoever travels the farthest shall be my successor. This test has no end-- only you can decide when you have traveled far enough.\"\n\nThe braves pack their belongings and depart the camp that evening, with Tall Bear and Falling Rocks racing to be the first through the pass. Despite being rivals, there was no animosity between them. They had fought alongside each other many times, and each felt that the other pushed him to his fullest potential. \n\nAfter a few days, one of the braves returned. \"I saw a great village of the whites, with more people than I ever knew lived on this world. It was heavily patrolled by soldiers and I felt I could go no further.\"\n\nA few weeks pass, and another brave returns to the camp. \"I visited vast lakes so large I thought they were part of the ocean, but the water was fresh, not salty. I encountered a great thunderous waterfall of tremendous power. At this point, I felt I could go no further.\"\n\nA month passes, and the third brave makes his way back. \"I saw a mighty river, larger than any I had seen before. I could find no way to cross its muddy waters, and was forced to turn back.\"\n\nAnother month passes until another brave returns from his quest. \"I made it to vast plains, with no trees in sight. Mighty horned beasts grazed in herds beyond counting. Their hooves shook the ground like thunder. I dared not risk being lost to the anger of these creatures, and had to turn back.\n\nMonths pass, and the fifth brave returns to the tribe. \"On my travels I discovered another range of mountains. Unlike ours, these were sharp and jagged, piercing the sky with their height. I thought that this must be the backbone of the world, but I could find no way to cross them, and could go no further.\n\nStill, neither Falling Rocks nor Tall Bear had returned, and the tribe had been severely weakened without them. They could not access their hunting grounds, which were now overrun with whites, and winter was once again threatening to seize the mountains in ice. The elders of the tribe were pressuring Black Wolf to name his successor now, because they could not survive waiting around for anyone else to return. Black Wolf held out for as long as he could, every day sitting on the peak where he had issued his challenge, watching the pass for the return of his nephew. Finally, the rest of the tribe had had enough, and demanded that he name the brave who most recently returned as war chief. Just then, a lone figure staggered through the mountain pass, wrapped in buffalo skins and holding some sort of strange shell. It was Tall Bear.\n\n\"I walked until I encountered another ocean. It was similar to ours, but I could tell it was also quite different. The life that inhabits it was unlike what we catch in our waters. However, I could find no way to go any further.\"\n\nBlack Wolf knew that he couldn't wait for Falling Rocks any longer, and named Tall Bear the new war chief, but every day he would go to the peak and watch the pass for his nephew. Eventually the cold winter air struck him with an illness that he knew he would not survive. Calling Tall Bear and the other braves to him, he told them that he still knew in his heart that Falling Rocks was still alive, and it was his dying wish to have the tribe always keep vigil for when he returns. Tall Bear and the other braves swore to never stop waiting for their brother in battle.\n\n\n\nAnd that's why, to this day, when traveling in those mountains, you can still see signs that say \"Watch for Falling Rocks\"",

As most women do, she wanted to take a little extra effort over hygiene when making such visits, but this time she wasn\u2019t going to be able to make the full effort.\n\nSo, she rushed upstairs, threw off her pajamas, wet the washcloth that was sitting next to the sink, and gave herself a quick wash in that area to make sure everything was at least presentable. She threw the washcloth in the clothes basket, donned some clothes, hopped in the car and raced to her appointment.\nShe was in the waiting room for only a few minutes when she was called in. Knowing the procedure, as I\u2019m sure you do, she hopped up on the table, looked over at the other side of the room and pretended that she was in Paris or some other place a million miles away.\nShe was a little surprised when the doctor said, \u201cMy, we have made an extra effort this morning, haven\u2019t we?\u201d She didn\u2019t respond.\n\nAfter the appointment, She heaved a sigh of relief and went home.

He starred intently at the empty shot glass in front of him. She sat across from him and said, \u201cAre you Taco \u2018No Guns\u2019 Marco?\u201d. He slowly nodded in the affirmative. Encouraged, she continued, \u201cDo you know Poncho \u2018Two Guns\u2019 Valdez?\u201d He slowly lifted his head, and out from under the brim of the sombrero two wild eyes revealed themselves and burned a hole in her soul. \n\n\n\u201cDo I know \u2018Two Guns\u2019? The baddest bandito in the land?\u201d He chuckled, \u201cYes, I know him.\u201d\n\n\nThe researcher\u2019s excitement was palpable. She\u2019d spent months scouring the Mexican highlands, and even a few weeks in the midlands, and had heard only stories, told in soft voices by terrified peasants and they looked over their shoulders, and now, finally, here was a friend of the great \u2018Two Guns\u2019 and he was talking!\n\n\nWithout being prompted he continued. \u201cLet me tell you a story my friend.  It was 15 years ago. It was a hot day at high noon and I tending sheep in the lowlands-\u201c\n\n\n\u201cLOWLANDS!\u201d Blurted out the researcher. \u201cOf course, the LOWlands! I should have guessed!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was tending sheep in the lowlands, like I said, and from the distance a man on a horse approached. As he came closer I saw a great big man on a white horse, with two guns in holsters on his hips, and I could smell the tequila on his breath even from a distance. As he approached he yelled \u201cI am Poncho \u2018Two Guns\u2019 Valdez, the baddest bandito in the land. Do you fear me peasant?\u201d, I nodded yes, as I truly was terrified.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen what happened?\u201d prompted the researcher.\n\n\n\u201cWell, he asked me my name and I said that I was Taco \u2018No Guns\u2019 Marco. He laughed, then screamed, \u201cDrop your pants, peasant!\u201d, and seeing that Two Guns had two guns and No Guns had no guns, I dropped my pants.\u201d\n\n\nThe doctoral student was very excited now, and as she tried to think how to fit the word \u201chomoerotic\u201d into her thesis title, NO Guns he continued.\n\n\n\u201cThen, he said \u201cBend over!\u201d\u201d I hesitated, but he said. \u201cI am Two Guns with two guns, and you are No Guns with no guns. I am the baddest bandito in the land and you are a sheep herder. You bend over now or you will die.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo I bent over and looked up and saw a big shit-eating grin on his face. Then he said, \u201cShit.\u201d\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShit?\u201d asked the doctoral student confusedly. \n\n\n\u201cYes, shit. So, with Two Guns having two guns and No Guns having no guns, I shit. And then Two Guns says \u201cEat shit.\u201d I hesitated again and Two Guns says \u201cTwo guns, two guns. No Guns? No guns. Eat shit.\u201d So I ate shit.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNow Two guns thought that this was so funny that he was really laughing. He laughed so hard that he fell off his horse and his two guns fell from their holsters and landed right in front of me. I picked them up and pointed them at Two Guns. He stumbled to his feet and looked at me with the blackest, meanest eyes I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDid you kill him?\u201d asked the doctoral student, not knowing what answer she wished to hear.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d said No Guns, and the doctoral student let out a relieved sigh that surprised her.\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI told him \u201cDrop your pants, bandito!\u201d, and seeing that No Guns had two guns and Two Guns had no guns, he dropped his pants.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThen, I said \u201cBend over!\u201d\u201d He hesitated, but I yelled. \u201cI am No Guns with two guns, and you are Two Guns with no guns. You are the baddest bandito in the land and I am a sheep herder... with two mother fucking guns. You bend over now or you will die.\u201d\n\n\nSo he bent over and looked up at me with my big shit-eating grin. Then I said, \u201cShit. So he shit.

Confused, the doctoral student asked No Guns, \u201cThen what happened?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI got on the horse and rode away as fast as I could,\u201d replied No Guns matter-of-factly.\n\n\n\u201cI thought you said you *knew* him?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, we had lunch together.\u201d\n",

The captain keeps his lady waiting in his quarters while he settles with the mistress of the brothel, betting his first mate wouldn't be brazen enough to plunder the Captain's choice pick with Tiltin Yardarm bearing witness.\n\nHowever, when the Captain returns, his wench is gone, and Yardarm begins to squawk a terrible account. Loony Doubloon is incensed-\n\"What transpired 'ere, and where's me choice wench?!\"\n\"Awk! Rusty Pegleg is all to blame, I swear me Cap'n!\"\nThis further infuriates Doubloon- \"Tell yer every bit of it or I'll 'ave ye defeathered 'n tarred!\" Titltin musters his courage- \"Awk! He burst through the door and thrust her to the bed!\" The captain now is boiling. \"And then what 'appened?!\"\nHis parrot begins to quiver. \"Awk! She moaned and begged him to drop his anchor!\"\nDoubloon unsheathes his cutlass in a fit of anger, pointing at his feathery witness- \"Spare no detail or it's yer life!\" Shivering, his misplaced target of anger musters- \"Awk! She was clawing for him to take her, begging him, pleading him 'Oh captain, Oh captain!'\"\nTo this, the maddened Captain Loony Doubloon thrusts the tip of his blade to the edge of the poor parrot's neck- \"Every bloody detail or yer to walk the plank and find Davey Jones locker with 'im!\" Tiltin Yardarm swallows heavily and replies- \"I can't bear witness to what happened next. I fell right off me perch!\"",

That way it grows to exactly the size you like.\"  The woman said, \"oh wow,\" pulled on his ears, and they had great sex.\n\nLater on, she met back up with her boyfriend and she said, \"Well, how was it for you?\"  He replied, \"I guess it would have been ok, but it was hard to concentrate because she just kept on tugging on my ears!\"  ",

On this planet there was a mountain, and atop the mountain was a tree which hosted the most delicious fruit known the the Trid race. But there was a problem: there was a cave near the top that was home to a monster, and every time the trids tried to climb to the top of the mountain, the monster would run out and kick them all back down.\n\nThe trids became tired of this, and so they contacted Earth to ask for help. Earth didn't find this to be that big of a problem as they were at war and dealing with many different things, so they sent over a rabi. The Trids were happy to have any help they could get, and so they gladly accepted. \n\nThe rabbi arrived and wanted to get straight to business, calling all of the Trids to the base of the mountain. A lot of them were too frightened, so only some showed up. The rabi led the Trids most of the way up the mountain, only to have the monster come out and kick all of the Trids down but not the rabbi. Frustrated, the rabbi went to the Trid village and told them that in order to get to the top, they would all have to show up and work together.\n\nThe next day more Trids showed up, but not all of them were there. The rabbi sighed, leading them up to have the monster once again kick down all of the trids, but leave him standing. The rabbi went back to the Trid village and told them that if every single last Trid wasn't in attendence the following day, he would return to Earth without helping them.\n\nThe next day, every single Trid was there. The rabbi smiled and started leading the Trids up the mountain, this time quite confident that they would make it all the way up. But as usual, the monster ran out of his cave and managed to kick every single Trid back down the mountain, once again leaving the rabbi standing. The rabbi went to the monster's cave and asked \"Monster, why do you only ever kick down the trids, but always leave me standing?\" To which the monster replied \"Silly rabbi, kicks are for Trids.\"\n\n",

        "body": "So, there's a man crawling through the desert.\n\nHe'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.\n\nHe stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.\n\nHe thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So, he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the direction he thinks is right.\n\nHe walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.\n\nHe pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.\n\nBy the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.\n\nAs it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things, he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.\n\nFull dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.\n\nHe wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.\n\nHe knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.\n\nHe rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.\n\nThen he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.\n\nLooking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.\n\nAs he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.\n\nHe decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle. He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to make some difference and keep himself from passing out.\n\nHe's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him, it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.\n\nHe walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills, dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water. Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.\n\nAfter a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.\n\nAfter more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it, trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.\n\nHe was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.\n\nHe walks through the sand.\n\nAfter a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.\n\nBut, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.\n\nHalfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.\n\nWhile crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape - shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.\n\nHe finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top, he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.\n\nAgain, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from here. He's going to have to go down there and look.\n\nHe puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune. After a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.\n\nHe stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.\n\nSo, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last chance.\n\nHe gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just keeps crawling.\n\nFinally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center, where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone area.\n\nHis mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun overhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying down on the nice cool surface.\n\nCool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him a drink. Then he'll know he's gone.\n\nHe decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the center before he goes. He keeps crawling.\n\nIt's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's hearing. He would swear that someone just said, \"Greetings, traveler. You do not look well. Do you hear me?\"\n\nHe stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and knees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something different - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands and tries again. Better this time.\n\nYep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet out of the stone, at an angle.\n\nAnd wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.\n\nHe stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to move from this spot.\n\nWell, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.\n\nHmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet - that was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.\n\nHe then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here because he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was likely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was now on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake was even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.\n\nHe tries to clear his throat to say, \"Hello,\" but his throat is too dry. All that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out, almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't good. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes out.\n\nHe gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips, and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk now.\n\nHe tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to spot the owner of this place, and croaks out, \"Hello? Is there anyone here?\"\n\nHe hears, from his side, \"Greetings. What is it that you want?\"\n\nHe turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides to try asking for help.\n\n\"Please,\" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, \"I'd love to not be thirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?\"\n\nLooking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its mouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he falls forward, face first on the stone, \"Very well. Coming up.\"\n\nA piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped around the tilted white post, still looking at him.\n\nHe reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet. He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes - they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been bitten. By the snake.\n\n\"It'll feel better in a minute.\" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more importantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!\n\n\"Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the afterlife?\"\n\n\"Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,\" says the snake. \"That's the way I work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.\"\n\n\"You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be thirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk? Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?\"\n\n\"No,\" says the snake, \"I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just sitting around here.\"\n\nThe man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer dying of thirst.\n\n\"I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your system with the next request,\" continued the snake. \"I can guess why you drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or two, if you drank enough of it.\"\n\n\"Ummm, n-next request?\" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.\n\n\"That's the way it works. If you like, that is,\" explained the snake. \"You get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish.\" The snake grinned at his own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.\n\n\"But there are rules,\" the snake continued. \"The first request is free. The second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of responsibility.\" The snake looks at the man seriously.\n\n\"By the way,\" the snake says suddenly, \"my name is Nathan. Old Nathan, Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound used to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into names. You can call me Nate, if you wish.\" Again, the snake grinned. \"Sorry if I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds somewhat threatening.\" The snake give his rattle a little shake.\n\n\"Umm, my name is Jack,\" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. \"Jack Samson.\n\n\"Can I ask you a question?\" Jack says suddenly. \"What happened to the poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that? What do you mean by that's how you work?\"\n\n\"That's more than one question,\" grins Nate. \"But I'll still try to answer all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question.\" The snake's grin gets wider. \"Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need to drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not be thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert. You've been changed.\n\n\"For the third question,\" Nate continues, \"you are still dying. Besides the effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal. In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years. Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is.\" Nate seemed vastly amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.\n\n\"As for the fourth question,\" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, \"first you have to agree to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell you.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" joked Jack, \"isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd have to kill me?\"\n\n\"I thought that was implied.\" Nate continued to look serious.\n\n\"Ummm...yeah.\" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was talking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a nasty temper. \"So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really stop the effects of the methanol?\" Jack thought for a second. \"And, what do you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper fluid, and just denature it?\"\n\n\"They may, I don't really know,\" said Nate. \"I haven't gotten out in a while. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and on that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you pulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume that they still color wiper fluid blue?\"\n\n\"Yeah, they do,\" said Jack.\n\n\"I figured,\" replied Nate. \"As for being bound by secrecy - with the fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me, this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me, write about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will lead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding anyway, so you won't notice.\" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.\n\nJack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a little nervous at this. \"Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?\"\n\nWell, Jack,\" said Nate sadly, \"I can't tell you that, unless you make the second request.\" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.\n\n\"Umm, well, ok,\" said Jack, \"what is this about a second request? What can I ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?\"\n\n\"Sure!\" said Nate, brightening. \"You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes to yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and before you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or omnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous and yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and sort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be omniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very useful, at least in my opinion.\" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was staring at him.\n\n\"Well, anyway,\" continued Nate, \"I'd probably suggest giving you permanent good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long time, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to recover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a request to me.\"\n\n\"Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?\" said Jack. \"And keep me healthy for a long time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request about a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not really a change to me?\"\n\n\"Right,\" nodded Nate.\n\n\"Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?\" Jack asked, hopefully.\n\n\"That takes two requests, Jack.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I figured so,\" said Jack. \"But I could ask to be a genius? I could become the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?\"\n\n\"Well, I could make you very smart,\" admitted Nate, \"but that wouldn't necessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you very athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either. You've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some truth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It all depends on what you decide to do with it.\"\n\n\"Hmmm,\" said Jack. \"Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request, after this one?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Nate, \"it depends on what you decide then. There are more rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second request. You know how it goes.\" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had shoulders.\n\n\"Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent health doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially. Do I need to sign in blood or something?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Nate. \"Just hold out your hand. Or heel.\" Nate grinned. \"Or whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said, that's how it works - the poison, you know,\" Nate said apologetically.\n\nJack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it didn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better about the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot snake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to be able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack tried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it wouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.\n\n\"Hey, Jack,\" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind him, \"is that someone else coming up over there?\"\n\nJack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of nowhere? And did they bring food?\n\nWait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...\n\nJack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through his jeans...\n\nJack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. \"I would have decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to hoodwink me like that.\"\n\n\"I've been doing this a long time, Jack,\" said Nate, confidently. \"You humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you - especially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of minutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the health benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, still,\" said Jack, \"it's the principle of the thing. And nobody likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or something instead?\"\n\n\"More meat in the typical human butt,\" replied Nate. \"And less chance you accidentally kick me or move at the last second.\"\n\n\"Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify to hear,\" answered Jack.\n\n\"Ok,\" said Nate. \"Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to just start talking?\"\n\n\"Just talk,\" said Jack. \"I'll sit here and try to not think about food.\"\n\n\"We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,\" answered Nate.\n\n\"Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!\" Jack jumped up. \"What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically whip up food along with your other powers?\" Jack was almost shouting with excitement. His stomach had been growling for hours.\n\n\"I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite it for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife, that is,\" replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to.\n\n\"Ugh,\" said Jack, sitting back down. \"I think I'll pass. I can last a little longer before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it is you find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw. No thanks. Just talk.\"\n\n\"Ok,\" replied Nate, still grinning. \"But I'd better hurry, before you start looking at me as food.\n\nNate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued. \"You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden.\"\n\nJack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate sceptically.\n\n\"Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack,\" said Nate. \"Stand up and look at the symbol on the rock here.\" Nate gestured around the dark stone they were both sitting on with his nose.\n\nJack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a representation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around was coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches left the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it looked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and embedded in the stone than it did like a carving.\n\nJack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the setting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the sky.\n\nWait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another night out here! Arrrgh!\n\nJack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and stood next to Nate. \"In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate,\" said Jack. \"Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to have to head back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw desert critters for long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to.\"\n\n\"It's about 30 miles that way.\" Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail this time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to the way he'd been going when he was crawling here. \"But that's 30 miles by the way the crow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be able to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head out early tomorrow, Jack.\"\n\nJack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and then sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading out right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting stuff. \"Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway,\" said Nate. \"He figured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a 'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he could never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from across the ocean. He worried about that for a while.\"\n\n\"Garden of Eden, hunh?\" said Jack. \"How long have you been here, Nate?\"\n\n\"No idea, really,\" replied Nate. \"A long time. It never occurred to me to count years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I do remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands of years, at least.\"\n\n\"So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?\" said Jack.\n\n\"Beats me,\" said Nate. \"Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your kind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it could have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant requests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals.\"\n\n\"Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out of the stone there?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much bigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember if it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But one day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do something for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've been here ever since.\n\n\"What is this place?\" said Jack. \"And what did he ask you to do?\"\n\n\"Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?\" Nate loosened his coils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into the stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to enter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned over and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as Jack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but Nate was suddenly there in the way.\n\n\"You can't touch that yet, Jack,\" said Nate.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I haven't explained it to you yet,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something,\" said Jack. \"You'd push it that way, and it would move in the slot.\"\n\n\"Yep, that's what it is,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"What does it do?\" asked Jack. \"End the world?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Nate. \"Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it 'The Lever of Doom'.\" For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing voice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and grinned.\n\nJack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned Jack laughed. \"Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it really do?\"\n\n\"Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said,\" smirked Nate. \"I just thought the voice I used was funny, didn't you?\"\n\nNate continued to grin.\n\n\"A lever to end humanity?\" asked Jack. \"What in the world is that for? Why would anyone need to end humanity?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Nate, \"I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment. Or maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really bad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are the rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I didn't think to ask back when I started here.\"\n\n\"Rules? What rules?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it unless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human can be bound in that way at a time. That's it.\" explained Nate.\n\nJack looked somewhat shocked. \"You mean that I could pull the lever now? You'd let me end humanity?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate, \"if you want to.\" Nate looked at Jack carefully. \"Do you want to, Jack?\"\n\n\"Umm, no.\" said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. \"Why in the world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want that! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate, \"being as he'd be human too.\"\n\n\"Has anyone ever seriously considered it?\" asked Nate. \"Any of those bound to secrecy, that is?\"\n\n\"Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or another. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and think, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get disgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while. But he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here.\" Nate grinned some more.\n\nJack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at the same time. After a bit, he said, \"So this makes me the Judge of humanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?\"\n\n\"That seems to be it,\" agreed Nate.\n\n\"What kind of criteria do I use to decide?\" said Jack. \"How do I make this decision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are bad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" replied Nate. \"You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's up to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed to know.\"\n\n\"But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel horrible? Couldn't I make a mistake? How do I know that I won't screw up?\" protested Jack.\n\nNate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. \"You don't. You just have to try your best, Jack.\"\n\nJack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly getting dark, chewing on a fingernail.\n\nSuddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. \"Nate, was Samuel the one bound to this before me?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate. \"He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to read and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried in the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months ago.\"\n\n\"Sounds like a good guy,\" agreed Jack. \"How did he handle this, when you first told him. What did he do?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Nate, \"he sat down for a while, thought about it for a bit, and then asked me some questions, much like you're doing.\"\n\n\"What did he ask you, if you're allowed to tell me?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"He asked me about the third request,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"Aha!\" It was Jack's turn to grin. \"And what did you tell him?\"\n\n\"I told him the rules for the third request. That to get the third request you have to agree to this whole thing. That if it ever comes to the point that you really think that humanity should be ended, that you'll come here and end it. You won't avoid it, and you won't wimp out.\" Nate looked serious again. \"And you'll be bound to do it too, Jack.\"\n\n\"Hmmm.\" Jack looked back out into the darkness for a while.\n\nNate watched him, waiting.\n\n\"Nate,\" continued Jack, quietly, eventually. \"What did Samuel ask for with his third request?\"\n\n...",

One day the farmer noticed the two racing each other around the pasture and thought to himself, \"Wow! These horses are quick!\" So the next day he entered them into a local derby. As the race was about to start, the horses were rearing and snorting to get let out of the gate. As soon as the gates swung open, both horses immediately bolted to the front of the race as the announcer was going wild, \"It's Hobbin-Noggin, Noggin-Hobbin, Hobbin-Noggin, Noggin-Hobbin, Hobbin-Noggin, and Hobbin wins by a nose!\" Excited by the win, the farmer then enters them into the Kentucky Derby. Once again, as soon as the gates open, both horses fly to the front of the race and it's Hobbin-Noggin, Noggin-Hobbin, Hobbin-Noggin, Noggin-Hobbin and again, Hobbin wins by a nose. This continues in every race until Hobbin has won the Triple Crown. By this point the farmer is beginning to realize just *how* fast these horses are, so he decides to enter them into a NASCAR race and *again*, it's Hobbin-Noggin, Noggin-Hobbin, Hobbin-Noggin, Noggin-Hobbin and again, Hobbin wins by a nose. This pattern continues until Hobbin wins the Sprint Cup. Still believing that he can push these horses further, he enters them both into an F1 Grand Prix. Unbelievably, against some of most well-engineered machines on Earth, as soon as the race started it was Hobbin-Noggin, Noggin-Hobbin, Hobbin-Noggin, Noggin-Hobbin and again, Hobbin wins by a nose. Hobbin won so often that he was named the World Drivers' Champion. After that the farmer decided that the horses had done it, they'd won the most prestigious races in the world; they had earned their retirement. Five years later, as the two horses were grazing in their pasture, Noggin walked up to Hobbin and said, \"Hey, you know, you won all of those races we were in. Do you think that we could race around the pasture, and you could just let me win one race?\" \"Okay, I'll do that for you\" Hobbin replied. So, just like the olden days, the two horses were off, and ever the same,  it was Hobbin-Noggin, Noggin-Hobbin, Hobbin-Noggin, Noggin-Hobbin, and *again*, Hobbin beats Noggin by a nose. The old farm dog, watching from the farmhouse's front porch, walks over and asks Hobbin, \"Hey, why'd you do that? You said you'd let him win, the race was just for fun; it meant nothing.\" To which Hobbin responded, \"WOW. Would you look at that? A talking dog.\"",

He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation to the old man.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don\u2019t know of anything that will keep her occupied for so many weeks, except a\u201d said the old man, and then he stopped.\n\n\u201cExcept what?\u201d asked the businessman.\n\n\u201cNothing, it's nothing,\u201d said the old man.\n\n\u201cPlease, tell me!

He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, \u201cBig fucking deal. It looks like any other dildo in this shop!\u201d\n\nThe old man said, \u201cBut you haven\u2019t seen what it\u2019ll do yet.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to a door and said \u201cVoodoo Dildo, the door.\u201d\n\nThe Voodoo Dildo rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, \u201cVoodoo Dildo, box!\u201d\n\nThe voodoo dildo stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, motionless.\n\nThe businessman said, \u201cI\u2019ll take it!\u201d\n\nThe guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, \u201cVoodoo dildo, my pussy.\u201d\n\nHe left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.\n\nAfter he\u2019d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the Voodoo Dildo. She lay down, placed the box between her legs, and said \u201cVoodoo dildo, my pussy!\u201d The voodoo dildo shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she\u2019d ever experienced before.\n\nAfter four orgasms, she decided she\u2019d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgotten to tell her how to shut it off! So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she\u2019d had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she hastily cried, \"The Voodoo Dildo! stuck in my pussy, can't get it out!! Ahhhhh! Need..To..Get..It..OUT!! H-h-help M-m-me!!!\"\n\nThe officer looked at her incredulously for a second, and then said, \u201cYeah, right. Voodoo dildo, my ass!\u201d",

His eyes wandered over to the ladder. As he looked it up and down, St. Peter notices his fascination. He smiles and informs the man that he may enter paradise there, through the pearly gates, or he could climb the ladder to success.\n\nThe man stood silent, considering his options, as well as the odd fact that heaven might have a ladder, let alone one that would lead to success. He figured, however, that he was already dead, and his luck could only really go up from here.\n\nHe walked over to the ladder, giving one last look at St. Peter and his pearly gates, and started to climb up into the clouds. Below him, fading into the haze, St. Peter's welcoming smile.\n\nThe man climbed until he reached another level of solid ground, or rather what might be considered solid ground in heaven's cloudy plane. He hopped off the ladder and stood in front of another gate, this one gold. There was no St. Peter this time to usher him in to eternity. In his place stood two beautiful women, easily two of the most beautiful he had ever seen, on this plane or in life.\n\nThey greet the man and inform him that, like below with St. Peter, he may enter paradise there or climb the ladder to success.\n\nThe man looked up at the ladder which stretched still upwards into the clouds. He had neglected to consider that there might be more after this. As before, he considered his options. He quickly came to the conclusion that he would be an absolute fool to not continue upwards. \n\nHe bid the lovely ladies farewell and continued his trek upwards to success.\n\nAgain, the man reached another solid stretch of clouds that held yet another gate and two new women in front. The gate this time, however, was a shimmering platinum that seemed to reflect or even glow with all the glory heaven might offer. This gate's keepers were two even more beautiful women who, as each other entity had done before here at the entrance to the afterlife, inform him of his option to enter heaven there or to climb the ladder to success.\n\nWhile he was in awe of the beauty, this time he barely took his foot off of the ladder before he was right back on it, smiling like a little child who finally understood Christmas.\n\nHe climbed to the next level, hopping off the ladder and tripping over himself, giddy at the prospect of the next site he might witness. Just like his previous experiences so far, he was not disappointed.\n\nHis eyes looked upon a site his years on earth had given him no vocabulary to describe. I am also sad to inform you that even I, telling you this story, fail at finding words. This was the gate to paradise. This was the promise of providence and the testament to both the power and the glory that was spoken of in psalms and uttered on the breaths of billions and billions of tiny prayers whispered by souls forgotten in the eternal ether. This gate was the proof those prayers were heard.\n\nThe man learned the meaning of the word \"awe\" as he stood slumped,\nSlack-jawed, and speechless as his tearing eyes took in the site.\n\nFrom seemingly out of no where walked this gate's keeper, a woman whose beauty was unmatched. She appeared to the man to be the sum of all of existence's beauty, grace, and kindness. She met the poor newly-lost soul with a tender caress, speaking, \"Poor, wanderer, I know you have come so far to reach here, not just climbing, but with the long, testing journey that is life. Here,\" she grabbed his hand and led him to the entrance \"you may enter and receive your great reward.\" \n\nThe man stood in front of eternity frozen, letting a gentle breeze blow across his cheek, through his hair, and through his fingers. He smiled a true, honest, pure smile.\n\nThe peaceful moment was broken by the angelic creature, who, again, placed the same offer in front of him as before: \"You are free to enter here, but the ladder to success continues on, if you wish.\"\n\nFor a moment, the man thought that this\nmight be enough. Why push it any farther? On the other hand, look at what he was able to witness! How could he not continue upwards? What could possibly be next?\n\n\"It is your choice: enter here, or continue on the ladder to success.\"\n\nThe man backed away, almost painfully, and started walking one slow, agonizing footstep at a time towards the ladder. He got to the ladder, put one foot on the rung, and gave one last gaze upon the wonder before him as he climbed upward.\n\nAt the next and, as he would soon find out, final plane, the man hopped off the ladder. He looked up and saw it didn't continue on into the clouds! He had reached the top! He had climbed to the top of the ladder to success!\n\nAs he eagerly awaited the final glory, he watched the ladder to success disappear and the hole it came through close. He stood looking out on an endless field of clouds, looking for a gate.\n\nThis time, though, there was no gate and no girl. Out from the distance walked a big balding man in sweats and a tank top scratching his nuts.\n\nShocked, the dead man asked the new figure, \"who are you? Are you God?\"\n\n\"No,\" the being replied, \"I'm Ces.\" ",

When there wasn't any answer, he continued knocking and knocking until finally, the owner of the Yugo lowered the window, and stuck his soaking wet head out.  \"I now have a bed in the back of my Rolls-Royce,\" the driver of the Rolls stated arrogantly.    \nThe driver of the Yugo looked at him narrowly and said, \"You got me out of the shower to tell me that?!?! \"",

        "body": "I was talking to this grizzled old mechanic friend one time, he looked like an old version of Yosemite Sam. Had a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, sounded like an old cowboy, his big ol' handlebar mustache wiggling and twitching with every word. Suddenly he starts telling this story about how he was out at the nearby HEB (big 24 hour grocery chain) one night at like 3am and he sees this drunk passed out on the ground. Just as he spots him, a cop does too, so he decides to help keep the guy out of the drunk tank for the night, because shit, he'd been there before.\n\nSo he scurries over just before the cop gets there, and explains that \"Oh no no, he's fine, sir, I was just pulling the car around, I'm taking him straight home.\" He pulls the guy up to his feet and kind of half carries, half walks him over to his own truck. Leans him up against it so he can get his keys back out and WHAM, the guy just topples. He sighs and kind of pins him up against the truck with his shoulder til his fishes out his keys, then goes to toss him in the cabin, but as soon as he sets him down he just crumples and tips out onto the ground again. The cop's starting to walk over so he crams him back in again, holds him against the seat while he buckles him in, hops in the driver's seat and takes off.\n\nAfter a few minutes he realizes he has no idea where the fuck he's heading, so he pulls into a gas station and tries to get the guy to give him some directions. All he can get out of him is a few gurgles and belches, but he realizes he's probably got some kind of ID, so he rummages through his pockets and finds a wallet in his jacket. The driver's license is expired, but it at least looks like him, so he plugs the listed address into his phone's GPS and starts heading back out.\nIt's way out in buttfuck nowhere, but he finally gets there and wakes the guy back up. He hops out of the truck and goes around the other side of the cabin to help him out. The guy kind of flops his hand around by the buckle, accomplishing nothing, then just gives him the most pathetic \"Help please\" look, so he reaches over him and pops the buckle. The drunk dude starts waving his arms in front of him like a zombie at a rave so he grabs his arms and pulls him out of the truck, and as soon as he lets go, BAM, on the floor. By this point it's like 4:30am, he wants to be done with this shit, so he yanks the guy up by the collar, pushes him against the truck so he can lock it up, and starts to drag him toward the door.\n\nThe guy's not even trying to walk by this point, he's just mumbling and giggling and belching, and the more he does it the more pissed off my friend gets. No good deed goes unpunished, the house is out in the country so the walk up to the door takes for-fucking-ever even if you're not hauling some stupid asshole drunk on bathtub vodka, and to make matters worse, every few feet he starts ranting and insisting that he can walk, and flopping around like an asshole til my friend would stand him up, let him go, then sure enough, WHAM. Face first onto the gravel. This happens a good four times before he gives up and just ignores him.\n\nThey finally reach the door, and he rings the bell. The guy's being a shithead again so he just lets his ass fall and this time he just lays there. Finally a little old lady answers the door and my friend explains where he found him, and that he's perfectly fine, just absolutely shithoused.\n\nShe thanks him profusely, then asks \"But where's his wheelchair?\"",

Millions of people died in camps and you are laughing about being gassed?\"  One of the other privates who hadn't done much talking immediately says to the LT, \"yeah sir, my grandfather died in a concentration camp.\"  Everyone kind of gets quiet because we weren't sure really what to say, the LT looks at him and puts a hand on his shoulder and says, \"I'm so terribly sorry for how insensitive everyone was being towards you, I sincerely apologize for the whole platoon.\"  Without missing a beat in an amazingly deadpan poker face, the private looks at my LT and says, \"the drunk bastard fell out of a guardtower.\"  The entire platoon was falling out of cots, rolling on the floor laughing to the point of crying at that magnificent set-up.  The LT just stands up, says \"watch my cot,\" and walks out of the tent.

A hidden security guard watches as the robber appears to be losing control and is afraid he may shoot people.  The security guard realizes he may only have one chance at this, so he takes aim at the robber, and carefully fires, taking him down in one shot.  As the robber falls, he gets off three shots, all hitting the pregnant woman in the stomach.  She is immediately rushed to the hospital and stays in emergency surgery for a while.  As she comes out from being under general anesthesia, there's a doctor standing over her telling her she's going to be alright.  The woman then asks the doctor how her baby is going to be?  The doctor smiles and tells her, \"actually, you're going to have triplets, 2 girls and a boy.  They all have a bullet lodged in their body that will pass out through normal metabolism.\"  The woman stays in the hospital for a few more days before returning home.  She eventually has 2 girls and a boy and around 12 years later, she is at home in the kitchen doing dishes.  One of the girls comes running out of the bathroom with a very worried look on her face.  The mother, upon seeing this, stops and asks her daughter what's wrong?  The girl says, \"mommy, I've done a very odd thing.\"  The mother asks her what she did.  The girl says, \"I was on the toilet, and I pooped a bullet!\"  The mother thinks back to her stay in the hospital, comforts the girl, and tells her the whole story.

The daughter says, \"mom, I've done something very weird.\" The mother asks her what she did.  The girl says, \"I was on the toilet, and I pooped a bullet!\"  The mother remembers this from 2 weeks ago and comfort her daughter while explaining the story.  Well, about 4 weeks later, the son is sitting on the couch, rocking back and forth, not sure what to do.  The mother sees this as she comes walking in the door after returning from the store.  She stops in tracks, looks at her son, and asks him whats wrong.  The boy looks at his mother, looks around carefully, and says, \"mom, I've just done a horrible thing and I didn't mean to.\"  The mother thinks for a second, and she says, \"did you poop a bullet?\" The boy looks up at his mother in shame and says, \"no, I was masturbating and I shot the dog.\"",

There was none of the odors or trash laying around that they had grown accustomed to seeing. The bartop in front of them seemed to have dismissed even the faintest of smudges. \n\nAt that moment they realized their thirst and remembered why they were there in the first place. Not surprisingly, the bartender suddenly became available and gave the introduction, \"Hello, fine people. My name is Tim and it is a pleasure having you in my bar. Take your time and..\" Silence. Utter horror. Horror! Tim, the bartender, recognizes that the husband is sporting a tie with a loose knot. Tim, twitching and with ready hands, asks if he may fix the husband's obvious oversight.\n\nReady to order and not having heard the bartender, the husband says, \"Surely, Tim.

Such were his blessings, but heed ye his curse.\n \nFor Khu, the Grand Shan, suffered from epilepsy, which men call the \"falling sickness\" - an affliction of sudden seizures, of convulsions occurring without warning.\n \nLike many great rulers, the Shan had enemies. And it remained for one, whose name was Ling-Po, to discover the cause of his curse. The Shan, a learned and intelligent man, was unusually sensitive to crude japes and mindless jests. It was on occasions when he was exposed to such idiocies - most notably in the form of puns - that he became enraged, and thus responsive to his seizures.\n \nKnowing this, Ling-Po devised what is called, in the heathen lands of the West, a \"shaggy dog\" story - a witless and revolting piece of nonsense designed to lead the unsuspecting reader to a \"punchline\" in the form of a truly disgusting pun. This particular story might well sicken any reader - and in the case of someone susceptible to epileptic seizures, it might even bring about his death.\n \nLing-Po inscribed his work on a scroll of parchment inserted in a golden tube, and personally presented it to the Shan as a birthday gift from an anonymous admirer.\n \nPresently it came to pass that the Shan unrolled the scroll. Ling-Po waited, his heart pounding in uncertainty as the Shan began to read. Would the Shan indeed experience an epileptic seizure when he came upon the filthy pun at the end?\n \nThe reading concluded, and for a moment Ling-Po waited, wondering if he had failed. \n\nBut he need not have worried, once the pun was read. For it was then that the fit hit the Shan.",

As I walked up to the leader, the KKK Biker Gang Rapists formed a circle around me. So, I ripped the leader's chain off his face and smashed him over the head with the tire iron. Then I turned around and yelled to the rest of them, 'Leave this poor, innocent girl alone!  You're all a bunch of sick, deranged animals!  Go home before I teach you all a lesson in pain!'\" \nSt. Peter, impressed, says \"Really?  When did this happen?\"\n\"Oh, about two minutes ago.\" \n",

The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.\n\nHowever, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car. \n\nMTA then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.\n\nThe Ornithological Behaviorist very quickly concluded the cause: when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger.\n\nThe scientific conclusion was that while all the lookout crows could say \"Cah\", none could say \"Truck.\"",

Can you guess how old I am?\n\n- Well miss, by the looks of it you could be very young. But I can tell you the correct answer if you let me grab your breasts! For you see, I was a doctor once, and  I have the ability to tell someone's age by this method!\n\nThis answer shocked the lady, but she was too curious. No one was around, so she shrugged and let the old man touch them. He gave a good grab, touched it all around. After a long inspection he says:\n\n- Well, by the looks and feels, I have to say.... well... you are... exactly 45 years old!\n\n- I am! That's amazing! How did you do that?\n\n- Easy! I was standing behind you in line at McDonald's!",

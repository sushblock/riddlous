This is a Catholic country; this city is the seat of Catholicism. People aren't going to give you money if you sit there with a Star of David in front of you, especially when you're sitting beside a beggar who has a cross.

Dozens of celebrities turned out to pay their respects, including Mrs. Butterworth, Hungry Jack, the California Raisins, Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies, and Captain Crunch.  The grave site was piled high with flours. \nAunt Jemima delivered the eulogy and lovingly described Doughboy as a man who never knew how much he was kneaded.  Born and bread in Minnesota, Doughboy rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with turnovers.  He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes. \nDespite being a little flaky at times, he still was a crusty old man, and was considered a positive roll model for millions.  Doughboy is survived by his wife Play Dough and three children: John Dough, Jane Dough and Dosey Dough, plus they had one in the oven.  He is also survived by his elderly father, Pop Tart. \nThe funereal was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes. \n\n\nIf you smiled while reading this, please rise to the occasion and pass it on to someone having a crumby day or kneading a lift. \n",

Still groggy she tries to determine what it is, and to her horror she sees the end of a bee disappear into her vagina!\n\nHalf panicking she throws on some clothes and heads for her doctor. When the doctor enters the examination room, she explains her predicament and her worry. \n\n\"And you're sure the bee is still inside you?\"\n\n\"Of course I am! What am I supposed to do about it?!\"\n\n\"Don't worry, just call your husband and have him meet you at home. Take some honey and cover the tip of his penis with it and let him enter you slowly. When he feels the bee eating the honey, just have him exit you real slow and pull the bee with him!\"\n\nAmazingly this plan calmed the woman some, but it had a huge flaw:\n\n\"I'm not married, and I have no boyfriend!\"\n\n\"Don't you have any close friends you could ask to help you?\"\n\n\"I don't have time for that, can't you do it? It's your plan and everything!\"\n\n\"Hmm, well I guess the situation is quite time dependent. Lay here on the bed and uncover yourself while I get some honey.\"\n\nAs the woman got situated the doctor got a bottle of honey from the lunch room. When he returned he took out his penis and covered the tip. Slowly he entered the woman until he was almost completely inside her.\n\n\"There he is! He just started eating the honey.\"\n\n\"Great! Does he stick to you when you pull out?\"\n\n\"No, he keeps dropping off!\"\n\nSo, the doctor goes slowly forward and backward and forward and backward trying to pull out the bee, he's getting more and more frustrated since the bee seems to go nowhere. Suddenly he increases his speed to a fast pace.\n\n\"What are you doing?! He'll never stick when you're going this fast!\"\n\n\"I changed my mind, I'll shoot that son of a bitch!\"",

        "body": "A couple of years ago I went out camping in the woods with a few of my friends. It was a dark and stormy night, and we felt very alone in our little tent, so we started telling scary stories.\n\nI described how the hills we were in used to be coal mining country, and the coal mines were dark and dangerous. If you didn\u2019t die from coal lung you\u2019d die from cave-ins, and if you didn\u2019t die from either of those, you\u2019d starve to death on the miniscule wages they paid you. The mine just up the hill from us was the worst. The manager had an extortion racket that he was keeping hidden from the owners - he would demand a \u201ctribute\u201d of 50% of the day\u2019s wages from each of his miners, or he would think up a reason to get them fired. Pay was starvation level even without giving the manager his cut, and so after a few months of this tribute the miners became pale, sickly, and emaciated. Paradoxically, they started working harder and harder, hoping they would strike it rich enough to get a bonus that they could use to get out of that awful place.\n\nOne of the miners worked even harder than the others. He just kept digging and digging, and when he looked back, he\u2019d gone too far, left everyone else behind, and couldn\u2019t find his way back. Life out there was so bad he found he barely cared. He just kept digging and digging and digging, figuring that working himself to death was as good a way to go as any other.\n\nFinally he came to a vein of rock darker than any he\u2019d ever seen before, and when he broke through it - wham! - he had dug all the way to Hell. Satan came over to meet him, and told the miner that they had a problem. He couldn\u2019t stay in Hell, because he wasn\u2019t a sinner. But he couldn\u2019t go back either, because the rules say no mortal may leave Hell alive. So Satan offered him a deal - he would transform the man into a vengeful ghost, who could spend eternity possessing mortals and driving them to madness.\n\nThe miner thought a bit, but he wasn\u2019t convinced. The only guy he wanted to possess and drive to madness was his evil manager who had stolen a tribute from every one of his paychecks. After getting revenge on him, he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted an eternity of possessing random other people. Satan suggested that maybe he could spend eternity possessing people and talking about how evil his manager was, so as to make his name forever dishonored. The man thought that was a good idea, and so with a word Satan transformed him into a spirit. He spent a while haunting his evil manager, then after that possessed random other people in the area to give monologues on how exploitative his manager\u2019s labor practices were.\n\nAnd so, I finished, sometimes, on nights much like tonight, with groups of campers much like our own\u2026\n\n\u201cHold on,\u201d interrupted my friend. \u201cIs this going to end with you saying that you\u2019re possessed right now, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re telling us this story?\u201d\n\n\u201cUm,\u201d I said\u2026\u201cI guess that\u2026\u201d\n\nJust then the police burst into our tent. \u201cStop right there!\u201d said one of the officers. \u201cYou\u2019re under arrest!\u201d\n\n\u201cFor what?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cPossession by a miner within tent to diss tribute.\u201d",

He later told the members of his congregation, and oh how they lauded him on his selflessness to ease the mind of a dying friend.\n\nMichael was a converted Muslim, and he feared that the dead had no use for paper money, so he converted the five thousand into gold for his friend, leaving the ingots next to the bills. He felt a great warmth inside of him, a feeling that can only be brought about by a good, charitable deed.\n\nDavid was born Jewish, but wasn't so devout as many of his colleagues. He refused to buck off the stereotype and worked as a moneylender, a loan agent. Because of this, he understood how exchange rates worked and how trying to convert 3 different types of money to one may be hard for a man with little experience handling cash. Therefore, he wrote a check for fifteen thousand dollars, and took the gold and bills as change.

        "body": "Once upon a time, there was a farmer who owned a small farm. He didn\u2019t have many animals, but he did have two he loved immensely: his dog Spot, and his prize winning race horse, the fastest horse ever to run in the Kentucky Derby, Bolt. One day, the farmer and Spot were in the stables to watch a mare give birth to Bolt\u2019s child. But to their surprise, the mare gave birth to not one, but two, strong, healthy foals. The farmer named the first born Buck and the second Casper.\nFrom the very beginning, Buck and Casper shared their father\u2019s competitive spirit. Within seconds of both being born, Buck looks at Casper and says \u201cHey brother! Let\u2019s see who can stand up first.\u201d Casper agreed, \u201cChallenge accepted.\u201d Buck tried to stand first, got half-way erect, and then fell over. Next Casper tried to stand, made it all the way up, wobbled, and fell down. Spot and the farmer watched intently, as this continued back and forth for a couple minutes, each brother standing a little longer than the other, until eventually Buck stood up and remained standing. \u201cI win!\u201d exclaimed Buck. \u201cYou sure did,\u201d Casper replied \u201cbut it was very close. I know I\u2019ll win next time!\u201d\nSome time passes, and the farmer decides that Buck and Casper are now old enough to be let out of the stables and explore the farm. The farmer, Spot and all the other animals gather around to watch the two young horses get their first taste of the outdoors. As soon as the two foals exit the stables, Buck turns to Casper and says \u201cYou see that fence across the field? Let\u2019s have a race! First one to the fence and back wins.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re on!\u201d Casper replies.\nAnd so the two horses take off towards the fence. First, Buck takes the lead, then Casper pulls ahead, then Buck takes the lead again as they reach the fence. On the way back the two horses are neck-and-neck, Casper ahead one second, Buck the next. Casper gives his all and takes a slight lead. \u201cI\u2019m going to win\u201d he excitedly thinks, but at the last second Buck has a burst of speed and pulls ahead by a foot, winning the race. \u201cI win!\u201d Buck neighs loudly. \u201cYou sure did brother,\u201d Casper replies \u201cbut that was very close. I\u2019ll win the next race, I just know it.\u201d\nHaving witnessed their race, the farmer decides to enter them in the next local horse derby. The farmer and Spot sit in the stands, watching with anticipation as the horses line up, Buck and Casper next to each other in lanes 3 and 4. \u201cThis is it! This is the race I\u2019m going to beat you!\u201d Casper says to Buck. \u201cProbably brother! You are very fast and trained very hard\u201d Buck says in return. At the sound of the gunshot, Buck and Casper take off out of the gates. They very quickly get way ahead of the other horses, and the two brothers stay neck-and-neck. First buck is ahead by a few inches, then Casper gets the lead, then Buck again, then Casper; back-and-forth until it seems like Casper finally has the lead. \u201cI got it this time!\u201d Casper whinnies in excitement, but suddenly Buck is right there next to him, and before Casper could dig deep for a burst of speed, they cross the finish line, Buck just a few inches ahead. \u201cDrat!\u201d Casper says, a little upset. \u201cThat was so close! I could taste victory.\u201d \u201cIt was a very good race brother!\u201d Buck says, \u201cI\u2019m very proud of you, that was the closest we\u2019ve ever been. I thought you had it for sure.\u201d\nA few years pass of Buck and Casper racing, training, and growing. Year after year the farmer enters them into the races, year after year the farmer and Spot watch, and year after year Buck wins by a hair, with Casper getting closer and closer with each race. Finally, Buck and Casper are so fast and so famous \u2013 The Twin Bolts, they\u2019re called \u2013 that they both get invited to compete in the Kentucky Derby. On the big day, the farmer and Spot watch from home on the TV as Buck and Casper wish each other luck, and go to their gates to await the race. The starting gun fires, and all the horses take off. This time it\u2019s a very close race; all the horses stay tight in a pack for most of the track. But near the end, all the horses begin to tire and slow \u2013 all the horses except for Buck and Casper.\nCasper manages to get a good lead, and he looks back to his brother and yells \u201cI\u2019m going to win this time, there\u2019s nothing you can do!\u201d But his cockiness got the better of him, and the farmer, Spot, and Buck all watched in horror as just before the finish line, Casper loses his footing and takes a terrible fall, knocking himself out.\nAfter the race, Casper wakes up back home in the stables, Buck watching over him intently. \u201cHow do you feel Casper\u201d Buck asks with concern, but Casper can think only of the race. \u201cDid I win?\u201d he asks. \u201cDid I finally beat you?\u201d Buck shakes his head solemnly \u201cI\u2019m afraid not brother. You stopped just in front of the finish line. The race was stopped because of your injury, but I was declared the winner since I was in second place.\u201d\nCasper is devastated by this news. \u201c\u2026but \u2026I was going to win\u201d he says sadly, trying to stand. But one of Casper\u2019s front legs gives him a sharp pain, and he falls over. \u201cAre you okay Casper?\u201d Buck asks, concern heavy in his voice. \u201cThe vet said you broke your leg. You need to give it time to heal.\u201d\nAnd so he did, but time never fully healed his leg. For years, Casper stayed at the farm, limping as he tried to run, while Buck continued to win Derby after Derby, eventually breaking his father Bolt\u2019s speed record and winning more Derbies than any other horse in memory. Spot would watch Casper from the porch, saddened by the state of the once proud equine.\nMany years later, the farmer retires Buck from racing. The two horses, now old, spend most of their time in the stables, Casper always quiet and sad. One day, Buck turns to Casper and says \u201cYou know brother, I miss the old days when we would race side-by-side. What do you say to one last race, huh?\u201d But Casper shakes his head and says \u201cThere\u2019s no point. Even in my prime, I could never beat you. What chance do I have now that I am old and lame?\u201d Saddened by his brother\u2019s depression, Buck gets an idea. \u201cYou know what brother? You\u2019re the reason I ran so fast. You inspired me, our whole lives, to push myself and be the best I could be. I always looked up to you.\u201d This makes Casper a little happy, so Buck continues \u201cI bet that you, my greatest inspiration, will beat me. There\u2019s no way you\u2019ll lose again, you\u2019re too good\u201d. \u201cAlright,\u201d Casper says, his spirits high for the first time in years \u201cI\u2019ll race you. To the fence and back, just like when we were kids. And this time I\u2019ll win!\u201d\nAs Buck and Casper exit the stables, Spot \u2013 now also very old \u2013 pads over to watch. The two horses start running, much slower than in previous years, but still with as much intensity as their younger selves would muster. Casper, his excitement allowing him to ignore his old injury, takes the lead. Buck, digging deep, catches up, and they continue neck-and-neck. On the final stretch, Casper pulls ahead. After so many years, he\u2019d finally get to know what it felt like to be number one, first place, the winner. Casper had never felt more proud or excited than at this moment in his life. But just before as he reaches the barn, Buck bolts past him, winning by a hair. Casper is crushed.\nNow Spot, who watched the young horses grow up from afar, gets angry at this. He walks up to Buck and growls \u201cWhy?! After all the years, after all your victories, why? You couldn\u2019t let your brother have this one race? You just broke his heart!\u201d To which Buck replies\n\u201cHoly shit, a talking dog!\u201d",

Only one of our tents and 2 sleeping bags got washed away. Luckily, none of us got drowned because we were all up on the mountain looking for Adam when it happened.\n\nOh yes, please call Adam's mother and tell her he is okay. He can't write because of the cast. I got to ride in one of the search and rescue Jeeps. It was great. We never would have found Adam in the dark if it hadn't been for the lightning.\n\nScoutmaster Ted got mad at Adam for going on a hike alone without telling anyone. Adam said he did tell him, but it was during the fire so he probably didn't hear him. Did you know that if you put gas on a fire, the gas will blow up?\n\nThe wet wood didn't burn, but one of the tents did and also some of our clothes. Matthew is going to look weird until his hair grows back.\n\nWe will be home on Saturday if Scoutmaster Ted gets the bus fixed. It wasn't his fault about the crash. The brakes worked okay when we left. Scoutmaster Ted said that with a bus that old, you have to expect something to break down; that's probably why he can't get insurance.\n\nWe think it's a super bus. He doesn't care if we get it dirty, and if it's hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the bumpers. It gets pretty hot with 45 people in a bus made for 24. He let us take turns riding in the trailer until the policeman stopped and talked to us.\n\nScoutmaster Ted is a neat guy. Don't worry, he is a good driver. In fact, he is teaching Horace how to drive on the mountain roads where there aren't any cops. All we ever see up there are huge logging trucks.\n\nThis morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out to the rapids. Scoutmaster Ted wouldn't let me because I can't swim, and Adam was afraid he would sink because of his cast (it's concrete because we didn't have any plaster), so he let us take the canoe out. It was great. You can still see some of the trees under the water from the flood.\n\nScoutmaster Ted isn't crabby like some scoutmasters. He didn't even get mad about the life jackets. He has to spend a lot of time working on the bus so we are trying not to cause him any trouble.\n\nGuess what? We have all passed our first aid merit badges. When Andrew dived into the lake and cut his arm, we all got to see how a tourniquet works.\n\nSteve and I threw up, but Scoutmaster Ted said it was probably just food poisoning from the left-over chicken. He said they got sick that way with food they ate in prison. I'm so glad he got out and became our scoutmaster. He said he sure figured out how to get things done better while he was doing his time. By the way, what is a pedal-file?\n\nI have to go now. We are going to town to post our letters and buy some more beer and ammo. Don't worry about anything. We are fine and tonight it's my turn to sleep in the Scoutmaster's tent.\n\nLove Johnny",

Why don't you come to our company and apply for a plumber position? You will earn three times as much as a professor.

The professor got a job as a plumber and his life significantly improved.

So, our professor had to go there too. It just happened that the first class was math. The evening teacher, to check students' knowledge, asked for a formula for the area of a circle. \n\nThe person asked was the professor. He jumped to the board, and then he realized that he had forgotten the formula. He started to reason it, and he filled the white board with integrals, differentials, and other advanced formulas to conclude the result he forgot. As a result, he got \"minus pi times r square.\"\n\nHe didn't like the minus, so he started all over again. He got the minus again. No matter how many times he tried, he always got a minus. He was frustrated. He gave the class a frightened look and saw all the plumbers whisper: \"Switch the limits of the integral!!\"",

There was a study where psychologists measured who was most correct in their determination on the value of creative work.\n\nThis study found that managers are really bad at measuring creative work. They're scared of looking bad and down value everything. They down value it something like two levels too low, the bastards. The creator of the work, though, is also bad at valuing the work. They're so wrapped up in it that they over value it at two levels better than it is. The people who are most accurate are peers. Peers value the creative work of other creators with fairly good accuracy.\n\nNow this is all pretty interesting in its Goldilocks way. But when I heard about all this I was most interested in the second evaluator. I was interested in how we evaluate our own creative work. And most particularly I was interested in how accurate my own evaluation is of my own work.\n\nWhat, I wanted to know, does this study say about how good my own work is? How good, for instance, is this that I'm writing now? I was delighted to find it tells me how good through a simple mathematical analysis.\n\nAssuming (as is the basis of the study) there is an absolute quality to this piece of creative work, we know from the study that I am, because I am writing it, valuing it at two levels better than it actually is.

Apparently that was enough for her to take interest, and even though I wasn't that into her once the initial novelty wore off, we spent the next few months dating.\n\n3 months later, it turns out that she's a virgin, and we still have not sealed the deal. This was fine with me, I was patient and respected her choices. At the end of one particularly memorable date, I pulled up in front of her house to drop her off and she leans over and kisses me before getting out of the car. I decided to go for broke and grabbed the back of her head, continuing the kiss a lot longer than usual. Things began to get hot and heavy and I could tell she was into it, but she was also incredibly nervous.\n\n\"I'm sorry Ender, I have to go, my grandmother's waiting for me inside.\"\n\n\"That's cool, can I meet her?\"\n\n\"Ummmm, sure, I guess....\"\n\nSo we go inside and introductions are made. We chat for a while and grandma tells me stories, like what Christmas was like in the 40's. I make Grandma laugh several times and she ends up adoring me, as most Grandmas do.\n\nFinally it was time to go. I said goodnight, and it was then that she smiled at me, winked, and nodded her head towards the stairs. I was totally expecting to just head home as usual, but it looked like my charm lit a fire in her and the situation was about to change for the better!\n\nWe eventually make it up to her room, and while she was incredibly nervous, I finally got her completely naked and things really started getting wild at that point. I never expected it, but she was a complete animal! That night may have been the best sex of my life.\n\nAt one point she stops me and says \"Maybe we should take a break.\"\n\n\"Why, is everything ok? Did I hurt you?\"\n\n\"No it's not that, it's just that I think I hear my granddaughter crying downstairs, and I really don't want to deal with that again tonight.\"",

        "body": "Tim was an adventurous man, and he had quite a bit of money. One afternoon during work, Tim decided that he wanted to go driving on the dunes in egypt. So that weekend, he booked tickets to Cairo and took a few extra days off work. When he arrived in Cairo he took a bus to a smaller village with less people and laxer laws and rented a car to drive on the dunes. He went out the first time at night around 11:30 because his flight came in late. \n\nTim had a marvelous time on the dunes: driving up and down them, going far too fast, and of course, drifting. He was at it all night and was having fun but the sky was getting brighter and he decided it was time to head home. As he started off towards the village the car suddenly sputtered and died and try as he might, Tim could not start it up again. Tim kept trying to start the car, he had extra gas so it wasn't that, what could it be? \n\nEventually Tim figured out the battery had died. This worried Tim slightly but he remembered the village was to the east so he figured he could walk. The car compass said the nose was pointing east so he took his water bottle from the car and started walking off in that direction. What Tim didn't know was that the compass wasn't accurate because the car had died so he ended up walking west instead of east. He walked for a few hours at which point he climbed to the top of a large dune to see if he could see the village. From the summit he looked and could only see the car several miles back where he came from and then nothing but desert for miles and miles around.\n\nTim decided it would be best to head back to the car and around mid day he made it back. He then decided it would be best to follow the car tracks. He followed and followed them along but ended up back at the car. Confused and frustrated, he thought how that could happen. He concluded that because he was doing donuts, he ended up following the wrong trail. He set out again determined to find the right one; an hour later he was back at the car. He tried one last time but the wind was covering the tire tracks with sand making traveling not possible and he was forced to return to the vehicle. Tim by this point was desperate. He decided his only option was to just pick a direction and hope for the best. He collected what little remained of his water and a bottle of wiper fluid he had in his car in case he needed fluids and picked a direction and started walking.\n\nBy the time Tim left the car it was pushing 6 o'clock. He walked and walked for several hours and ended up at the foot of a large sand dune. Tim decided that his best chance of survival was to climb the dune so he set out. About 45 feet up he was feeling the burn and pretty soon it became too steep to climb. Tim got on his hands and knees determined to climb the dune. About half way up he chugged the last of his water and continued to forge on. About 3/4ths of the way up he felt like he was dying of dehydration and decided that having some fluids in him was better than none and he could be cured of the poison back in the town, so Tim drank the wiper fluid. The fluids in him again had him feeling rejuvenated and he pushed to the top of the dune.\n\nWhen he reached the top his head was spinning from the wiper fluid but he had made it! He crested the peak and looked out into the falling sun expecting to see the village. Unfortunately all he saw around him was desert. Disheartened he looked to going back down the dune when he noticed something, a smallish wooden and straw structure half buried in the sand. He started crawling down the dune toward the structure, now fully feeling the effects of the poison. He crawled into an opening in the structure and by this time he was barely conscious. Inside the structure was a golden colored lever. This confused Tim, and when he stood up to try and push it, his head started spinning something bad and he collapsed into unconsciousness. \n\nTim woke up to light coming through the cracks in the building and felt rejuvenated. He felt healthy. \"How is this possible?\" Tim thought to himself, \"am I dead?\" Tim started to sit up, those questions floating through his head when all of a sudden he was face to face with a snake. And much to Tim's astonishment, the snake began to speak. \"Hello I am nate the snake\" The snake said. Tim was confused and scared but he worked up the nerve to sputter out a few \"whats\" and \"hows.\" The snake interrupted Tim's unintelligible babbling to say \"Travelers usually don't find this place, and the ones that do get 2 wishes. I saw that you were poisoned, dehydrated, and dying so I granted a wish on your behalf allowing you to survive and stay healthy without a need for food and water.\" This made about as much sense as any explanation that Tim thought of so he accepted it. The next question that came to Tim's mind concerned the lever. Nate the Snake began to explain: \n\"The lever is a doomsday lever, in fact, this area used to be what you know as the garden of eden. This lever was supposed to destroy the world and all its inhabitants if the animals became corrupt or evil, since then humanity has spread all across the planet and we can't have the world ending now can we?\" \n\nTim didn't quite buy it but the snake continued his story: \"I am descendant of a generation of serpents supposed to guard this lever and make sure no travelers, such as yourself, wander across this lever and push it killing everybody.\" \nBy this point Tim was so confident he was hallucinating that he just went along with it. The snake asked if Tim had any questions: \n\"Ya so do you know where the village is?\" Tim asked. Nate the Snake replied with a short \"no\" and continued to talk on about how Tim is the first person he'd seen in many many years, as it became more apparent that Tim didn't really care, Nate the Snake pointed out that Tim still had one wish. \"Oh right!\" Tim exclaimed and proceeded to ask Nate for an internal compass so that Tim would always know where he wanted to go. Suddenly, Tim knew the way to the village, it was about a days walk southeast of where the structure was. With that in mind, Tim thanked Nate and promised to visit again (still thinking he's hallucinating but at least he has a direction to go now) and he set out southeast to where he hoped the town was.\n\nTim stumbled into town later in the day convinced that he was just lucky and that the Nate the Snake encounter was a fever dream on account of the poison. He checked into a hospital and was given drugs to flush out the toxins but he was fine. He decided to cut his trip short on account of his odd adventure in the desert and he took a bus back to Cairo the next day then flew home. Tim continued his life where he left off, and he told all his friends about his ordeal in the desert, and he went on with his normal life for about 5 years.\n\nThen one day Tim was going to go out to eat with is friends and something occurred to him: he hadn't eaten or drank anything in over a week, he'd just been too busy and didn't think of it. This puzzled Tim as he racked his brain to figure out why then suddenly the whole Nate the Snake encounter came flooding back to him. If he didn't need to eat or drink, that means the whole encounter much had actually happened! Tim became terrified then excited as he considered the possibilities of it then he remembered the promise he made to Nate to come back and visit him. He hastily bought a ticket to Cairo for the weekend and took a couple days off work. The flight was uneventful and he ended up in Cairo where he took a bus to the small village.\n\nTim didn't have the money to rent a car this time but since he didn't need to eat or drink he figured  he could just walk to Nate's domain. With his internal map pointing the way, Tim set off into the desert to the Northwest and walked for the rest of the afternoon and well into the night. By the time the sun was rising behind him, Tim walked over the final dune and saw the small wood and grass structure that housed the lever. When Tim was approaching the structure, Nate the Snake slithered out in front of him. \"Tim!\" Nate the Snake exclaimed, \"I thought you'd forgot about me\" \nTim felt blood rushing into his cheeks as he felt ashamed about forgetting, \"Im sorry Nate, Ive just been so busy living my life and honestly, i chocked our whole meeting up to hallucinations due to the poison\"\n\"Thats understandable\" nate said \"Thank you for coming back though it really means a lot to me, anyway I have someone to introduce you to.\"\nAs if on cue, a smaller snake slithered out.\n\"Tim\" Nate continued, \"This is my son Joe\"\n\"Oh hi there\" Tim said\n\"Now tim,\" Nate said, \"I actually have a huge favor to ask you, my son, Joe, will take over my job when I die and be bound to guard the lever forever. I want you to take Joe with you and show him the world, I know this is a lot to ask but please, I want him to see the world before he's bound to the lever forever\"\n\nTim was hesitant but he figured that Nate had saved his life, so he owed him that favor. So after the meeting, Tim and Joe trekked back across the desert to the village and back to Cairo. Nate quit his job and they spent the remainder of his money traveling the world. Tim and Joe travelled Asia first, then the americas and finally they went to europe. It was around the 5th month of the traveling and Tim and Joe ended up in a bar in Norway. Over some beers they were discussing their plans next and Joe spoke up saying that they had been gone for a while and that it might be time to go back.  Tim agreed that it was time and they flew out to Cairo a few days later.\n\nThey landed in Cairo and took the bus to the village and started walking the day and a half journey to Nate and Joe's home. After about 6 hours of walking, Tim and Joe came across a car half buried in the sand. Tim brushed off the sand and unburied it from the sand before climbing inside. After checking out the car and briefly looking at the engine, Tim concluded that it was in working order. Tim and Joe searched a little bit for a person to whom the car belonged but found nobody around, so they hot-wired the car and started driving to shave off many hours from their journey. \n\nAfter a few hours of driving they were nearing the lever and started the last downhill section toward the lever. The car started picking up speed so Tim applied the break, and nothing happened. Tim started panicking and slamming the break but the car didn't slow down at all. \"Whats wrong?\" Joe asked with a tone of fear in his voice.\n\"The car's breaks or jammed it isn't working\"\nTim and Joe both pushed on the breaks as hard as they could but nothing happened. They turned off the engine in desperation but the car kept sliding toward the structure, suddenly, Nate came out of the structure to the left facing away from the car but he couldn't hear because the engine was off. There was a flat area behind the structure so Tim figured if he just turned right he could roll to a stop.\n\nTim turned the wheel right but the car didn't shift at all because the tires were stuck in a groove. Tim kept trying to turn it but nothing was happening, he briefly by accident shifted the wheel left and the car moved. The car was going quickly toward the lever building and they had to make a move. Tim kept yelling \"What do I do?\" to Joe, he could either hit the building or move left and hit Nate because the car wouldn\u2019t go right. Joe was rather quiet and then he looked Tim with tears in his and rested his tail upon the wheel and started pushing it to the left. Tim looked confused and scared as joe maneuvered the car so that it would hit Nate. Tim looked at Joe and asked, \"Why?\" and Joe looked back, crying now, and said:\n\nBetter Nate than lever.",

There was always excitement, always rum, and always loot, but as the weeks went by he began to realize that life on a ship at sea away from women was a bit lonely. The first mate seeing his frustration walked over and asked what was wrong. The man explained that it had been quite a while since he had enjoyed the company of a nice round female. The first mate winked and said, \"You haven't heard of The Barrel.\" \"The Barrel?\" \"Yes, it's a barrel down in the lower levels with two holes in it. When you feel the need arise, you slip yourself into one of those holes.\" The man is curious and one night slips down into the hold and finds the barrel. A little embarrassed, but somewhat excited he slips his member into one of the holes. To his amazement, warmth and pleasure surround his tool and he soon finishes. The next day he visits the barrel again, and later on again. Soon he's visiting the barrel five, sometimes six times a day. Then one day as he lounges around the first mate walks up to him. \"How are you enjoying the barrel then?\", the first mate asks. \"It's so amazing\", the man says, \"I don't understand how it feels so good.\" The first mate nods knowingly. The man turns to the first mate, \"What's in the barrel? I really want to know.\" The first mate smiles and says, \"Good! Because it's your week in it!\"",

        "body": "So, there's a man crawling through the desert.\n\nHe'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.\n\nHe stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.\n\nHe thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So, he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the direction he thinks is right.\n\nHe walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.\nHe pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.\n\nBy the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.\n\nAs it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things, he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.\n\nFull dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.\n\nHe wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.\n\nHe knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.\n\nHe rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.\n\nThen he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.\n\nLooking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.\n\nAs he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.\n\nHe decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle. He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to make some difference and keep himself from passing out.\n\nHe's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him, it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.\n\nHe walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills, dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water. Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.\n\nAfter a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.\nAfter more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it, trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.\n\nHe was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.\n\nHe walks through the sand.\n\nAfter a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.\n\nBut, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.\n\nHalfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.\n\nWhile crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape - shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.\n\nHe finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top, he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.\n\nAgain, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can't tell from here. He's going to have to go down there and look.\n\nHe puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune. After a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.\n\nHe stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.\n\nSo, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last chance.\n\nHe gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just keeps crawling.\n\nFinally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center, where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone area.\n\nHis mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun overhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying down on the nice cool surface.\n\nCool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him a drink. Then he'll know he's gone.\n\nHe decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the center before he goes. He keeps crawling.\n\nIt's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's hearing. He would swear that someone just said, \"Greetings, traveler. You do not look well. Do you hear me?\"\n\nHe stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and knees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something different - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands and tries again. Better this time.\n\nYep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet out of the stone, at an angle.\n\nAnd wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.\nHe stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to move from this spot.\nWell, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.\nHmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet - that was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.\nHe then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here because he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was likely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was now on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake was even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.\nHe tries to clear his throat to say, \"Hello,\" but his throat is too dry. All that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out, almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't good. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes out.\n\nHe gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips, and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk now.\n\nHe tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to spot the owner of this place, and croaks out, \"Hello? Is there anyone here?\"\n\nHe hears, from his side, \"Greetings. What is it that you want?\"\n\nHe turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides to try asking for help.\n\n\"Please,\" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, \"I'd love to not be thirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?\"\n\nLooking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its mouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he falls forward, face first on the stone, \"Very well. Coming up.\"\n\nA piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped around the tilted white post, still looking at him.\n\nHe reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet. He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes - they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been bitten. By the snake.\n\n\"It'll feel better in a minute.\" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more importantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!\n\n\"Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the afterlife?\"\n\n\"Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,\" says the snake. \"That's the way I work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.\"\n\n\"You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be thirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk? Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?\"\n\n\"No,\" says the snake, \"I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just sitting around here.\"\nThe man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer dying of thirst.\n\n\"I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your system with the next request,\" continued the snake. \"I can guess why you drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or two, if you drank enough of it.\"\n\n\"Ummm, n-next request?\" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.\n\n\"That's the way it works. If you like, that is,\" explained the snake. \"You get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish.\" The snake grinned at his own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.\n\n\"But there are rules,\" the snake continued. \"The first request is free. The second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of responsibility.\" The snake looks at the man seriously.\n\n\"By the way,\" the snake says suddenly, \"my name is Nathan. Old Nathan, Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound used to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into names. You can call me Nate, if you wish.\" Again, the snake grinned. \"Sorry if I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds somewhat threatening.\" The snake give his rattle a little shake.\n\n\"Umm, my name is Jack,\" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. \"Jack Samson.\n\n\"Can I ask you a question?\" Jack says suddenly. \"What happened to the poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that? What do you mean by that's how you work?\"\n\n\"That's more than one question,\" grins Nate. \"But I'll still try to answer all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question.\" The snake's grin gets wider. \"Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need to drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not be thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert. You've been changed.\n\n\"For the third question,\" Nate continues, \"you are still dying. Besides the effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal. In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years. Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is.\" Nate seemed vastly amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.\n\n\"As for the fourth question,\" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, \"first you have to agree to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell you.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" joked Jack, \"isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd have to kill me?\"\n\"I thought that was implied.\" Nate continued to look serious.\n\n\"Ummm...yeah.\" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was talking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a nasty temper. \"So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really stop the effects of the methanol?\" Jack thought for a second. \"And, what do you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper fluid, and just denature it?\"\n\n\"They may, I don't really know,\" said Nate. \"I haven't gotten out in a while. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and on that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you pulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume that they still color wiper fluid blue?\"\n\n\"Yeah, they do,\" said Jack.\n\n\"I figured,\" replied Nate. \"As for being bound by secrecy - with the fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me, this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me, write about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will lead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding anyway, so you won't notice.\" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.\n\nJack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a little nervous at this. \"Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?\"\n\nWell, Jack,\" said Nate sadly, \"I can't tell you that, unless you make the second request.\" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.\n\n\"Umm, well, ok,\" said Jack, \"what is this about a second request? What can I ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?\"\n\n\"Sure!\" said Nate, brightening. \"You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes to yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and before you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or omnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous and yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and sort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be omniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very useful, at least in my opinion.\" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was staring at him.\n\n\"Well, anyway,\" continued Nate, \"I'd probably suggest giving you permanent good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long time, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to recover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a request to me.\"\n\n\"Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?\" said Jack. \"And keep me healthy for a long time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request about a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not really a change to me?\"\n\n\"Right,\" nodded Nate.\n\n\"Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?\" Jack asked, hopefully.\n\n\"That takes two requests, Jack.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I figured so,\" said Jack. \"But I could ask to be a genius? I could become the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?\"\n\n\"Well, I could make you very smart,\" admitted Nate, \"but that wouldn't necessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you very athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either. You've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some truth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It all depends on what you decide to do with it.\"\n\n\"Hmmm,\" said Jack. \"Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request, after this one?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Nate, \"it depends on what you decide then. There are more rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second request. You know how it goes.\" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had shoulders.\n\"Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent health doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially. Do I need to sign in blood or something?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Nate. \"Just hold out your hand. Or heel.\" Nate grinned. \"Or whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said, that's how it works - the poison, you know,\" Nate said apologetically.\n\nJack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it didn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better about the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot snake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to be able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack tried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it wouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.\n\n\"Hey, Jack,\" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind him, \"is that someone else coming up over there?\"\n\nJack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of nowhere? And did they bring food?\nWait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...\n\nJack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through his jeans...\n\nJack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. \"I would have decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to hoodwink me like that.\"\n\n\"I've been doing this a long time, Jack,\" said Nate, confidently. \"You humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you - especially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of minutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the health benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, still,\" said Jack, \"it's the principle of the thing. And nobody likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or something instead?\"\n\n\"More meat in the typical human butt,\" replied Nate. \"And less chance you accidentally kick me or move at the last second.\"\n\n\"Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify to hear,\" answered Jack.\n\n\"Ok,\" said Nate. \"Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to just start talking?\"\n\n\"Just talk,\" said Jack. \"I'll sit here and try to not think about food.\"\n\n\"We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,\" answered Nate.\n\n\"Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!\" Jack jumped up. \"What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically whip up food along with your other powers?\" Jack was almost shouting with excitement. His stomach had been growling for hours.\n\n\"I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite it for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife, that is,\" replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to.\n\n\"Ugh,\" said Jack, sitting back down. \"I think I'll pass. I can last a little longer before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it is you find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw. No thanks. Just talk.\"\n\n\"Ok,\" replied Nate, still grinning. \"But I'd better hurry, before you start looking at me as food.\n\nNate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued. \"You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden.\"\n\nJack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate sceptically.\n\n\"Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack,\" said Nate. \"Stand up and look at the symbol on the rock here.\" Nate gestured around the dark stone they were both sitting on with his nose.\n\nJack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a representation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around was coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches left the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it looked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and embedded in the stone than it did like a carving.\n\nJack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the setting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the sky.\n\nWait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another night out here! Arrrgh!\n\nJack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and stood next to Nate. \"In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate,\" said Jack. \"Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to have to head back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw desert critters for long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to.\"\n\n\"It's about 30 miles that way.\" Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail this time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to the way he'd been going when he was crawling here. \"But that's 30 miles by the way the crow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be able to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head out early tomorrow, Jack.\"\n\nJack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and then sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading out right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting stuff. \"Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway,\" said Nate. \"He figured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a 'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he could never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from across the ocean. He worried about that for a while.\"\n\n\"Garden of Eden, hunh?\" said Jack. \"How long have you been here, Nate?\"\n\n\"No idea, really,\" replied Nate. \"A long time. It never occurred to me to count years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I do remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands of years, at least.\"\n\n\"So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?\" said Jack.\n\n\"Beats me,\" said Nate. \"Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your kind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it could have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant requests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals.\"\n\n\"Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out of the stone there?\" asked Jack.\n\"Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much bigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember if it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But one day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do something for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've been here ever since.\n\n\"What is this place?\" said Jack. \"And what did he ask you to do?\"\n\n\"Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?\" Nate loosened his coils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into the stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to enter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned over and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as Jack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but Nate was suddenly there in the way.\n\n\"You can't touch that yet, Jack,\" said Nate.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I haven't explained it to you yet,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something,\" said Jack. \"You'd push it that way, and it would move in the slot.\"\n\"Yep, that's what it is,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"What does it do?\" asked Jack. \"End the world?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Nate. \"Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it 'The Lever of Doom'.\" For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing voice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and grinned.\nJack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned Jack laughed. \"Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it really do?\"\n\n\"Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said,\" smirked Nate. \"I just thought the voice I used was funny, didn't you?\"\nNate continued to grin.\n\n\"A lever to end humanity?\" asked Jack. \"What in the world is that for? Why would anyone need to end humanity?\"\n\"Well,\" replied Nate, \"I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment. Or maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really bad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are the rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I didn't think to ask back when I started here.\"\n\"Rules? What rules?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it unless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human can be bound in that way at a time. That's it.\" explained Nate.\n\nJack looked somewhat shocked. \"You mean that I could pull the lever now? You'd let me end humanity?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate, \"if you want to.\" Nate looked at Jack carefully. \"Do you want to, Jack?\"\n\n\"Umm, no.\" said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. \"Why in the world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want that! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate, \"being as he'd be human too.\"\n\n\"Has anyone ever seriously considered it?\" asked Nate. \"Any of those bound to secrecy, that is?\"\n\n\"Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or another. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and think, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get disgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while. But he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here.\" Nate grinned some more.\n\nJack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at the same time. After a bit, he said, \"So this makes me the Judge of humanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?\"\n\n\"That seems to be it,\" agreed Nate.\n\n\"What kind of criteria do I use to decide?\" said Jack. \"How do I make this decision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are bad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" replied Nate. \"You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's up to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed to know.\"\n\n\"But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel horrible? Couldn't I make a mistake? How do I know that I won't screw up?\" protested Jack.\n\nNate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. \"You don't. You just have to try your best, Jack.\"\n\nJack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly getting dark, chewing on a fingernail.\n\nSuddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. \"Nate, was Samuel the one bound to this before me?\"\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate. \"He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to read and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried in the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months ago.\"\n\"Sounds like a good guy,\" agreed Jack. \"How did he handle this, when you first told him. What did he do?\"\n\"Well,\" said Nate, \"he sat down for a while, thought about it for a bit, and then asked me some questions, much like you're doing.\"\n\n\"What did he ask you, if you're allowed to tell me?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"He asked me about the third request,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"Aha!\" It was Jack's turn to grin. \"And what did you tell him?\"\n\n\"I told him the rules for the third request. That to get the third request you have to agree to this whole thing. That if it ever comes to the point that you really think that humanity should be ended, that you'll come here and end it. You won't avoid it, and you won't wimp out.\" Nate looked serious again. \"And you'll be bound to do it too, Jack.\"\n\"Hmmm.\" Jack looked back out into the darkness for a while.\n\nNate watched him, waiting.\n\n\"Nate,\" continued Jack, quietly, eventually. \"What did Samuel ask for with his third request?\"\n\nNate sounded like he was grinning again as he replied, also quietly, \"Wisdom, Jack. He asked for wisdom. As much as I could give him.\"\n\n\"Ok,\" said Jack, suddenly, standing up and facing away from Nate, \"give it to me.\n\nNate looked at Jack's backside. \"Give you what, Jack?\"\n\n\"Give me that wisdom. The same stuff that Samuel asked for. If it helped him, maybe it'll help me too.\" Jack turned his head to look back over his shoulder at Nate. \"It did help him, right?\"\n\n\"He said it did,\" replied Nate. \"But he seemed a little quieter afterward. Like he had a lot to think about.\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, I can see that,\" said Jack. \"So, give it to me.\" Jack turned to face away from Nate again, bent over slightly and tensed up.\nNate watched Jack tense up with a little exasperation. If he bit Jack now, Jack would likely jump out of his skin and maybe hurt them both.\n\n\"You remember that you'll be bound to destroy humanity if it ever looks like it needs it, right Jack?\" asked Nate, shifting position.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, I got that,\" replied Jack, eyes squeezed tightly shut and body tense, not noticing the change in direction of Nate's voice.\n\n\"And,\" continued Nate, from his new position, \"do you remember that you'll turn bright purple, and grow big horns and extra eyes?\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah...Hey, wait a minute!\" said Jack, opening his eyes, straightening up and turning around. \"Purple?!\" He didn't see Nate there. With the moonlight Jack could see that the lever extended up from its slot in the rock without the snake wrapped around it.\n\n\nCONTINUES IN COMMENTS\n",

He opens the door and is surprised to see his downstairs neighbor. \n\"Hey man,\" says the neighbor. \"I know you're angry and all, but I just got a new job I've got to be up early for and you slamming your shoes down makes it hard to sleep. Can you be quieter?\"\n\nThe man apologizes and promises to be quieter for his neighbor. \n\nThe next night, the man comes home, and, remembering his neighbor, sets down his shoes quietly. This new practice goes on for a few days, but eventually, the stress of the job begins to get to him again, until one night, he comes home, frustrated as ever. He takes off one shoe and slams it onto the ground: \n\"DAMN MY LIFE!\" \nThen, suddenly embarrassed, he remembers his neighbor. He takes his other shoe and sets it down quietly next to the first one. After a few minutes, there's a knock at the door. The man opens the door to see his neighbor again, who says, \"Can you just slam the other shoe so that I can go to sleep?!\" \n\n\n[my dad's joke, not sure where he got it from, but I hope it's original enough to make people laugh.]",

        "body": "So I recently moved into a new neighborhood and it's a pretty nice area. After a couple of weeks, a moving truck pulls up and I realize there's a new girl living in the house next to me. So I walk out and I notice that she's all by herself. \n\nBeing the good neighbor I am, I go up and ask, \"Hey, I see you don't have any help. Do you need any help with moving your boxes inside?\" \n\nAnd keep this in mind, I'm like a 6/10 on good day while this girl is an easy 9/10. Like this girl can easily be a supermodel. \n\nSo I ask if she needs any help and she looks me dead in the eye with the nastiest grimace on her face and says, *\"Uh... No thanks, I'm good.\"* \n\n\"Well ok. No problem. If you need anything, just give a little knock on the door and I'll come out.\"\n\nSo a couple days go by after that failed attempt and this girl's dumb, small chihuahua jumps over the fence and gets into my yard. So I'm thinking, \"Ok cranky girl. Round 2, let's go, we got this.\"\n\nSo I take the dumb dog and I bring it over to her house and give the door a knock. She opens the door and with the biggest smile says, \"OH MY GOD thank you SO MUCH! I don't know what I would do without him. He's like family to me. I'm so sorry that I was so mean to you the other day. I was having a bad day and took it out on you and I'm so sorry. Please let me make it up to you and take you out to dinner.\"\n\nSo I humbly accept and we end up going out to dinner that night. Now, we don't have much in common. Like, I'm into video games and anime and she's into all this white girl stuff like makeup, Starbucks, and all that other shit. But, we have a good time. And I mean, this girl is WAY out of my league so who am I to complain? So then we hang out more frequently, I visit her and she visits me and now I'm in a good relationship with this extremely hot chick.\n\nA couple weeks go by, we continue this, and I see a moving truck come in from the other direction. I go out to greet the new neighbor and I see a cute girl come out of the moving truck. Now this girl is cute. She isn't supermodel hot, but she's cute. I would say she's like a 7/10. So I go up to her and say, \"Hey, I see you don't have any help with moving your stuff in. Is it ok if I help?\" Luckily, she says, \"Yeah, sure. Um, take this box and put it in the living room. It's the first room to the right, you can't  miss it.\"\n\nSo I go to pick up the box and I realize that it's labeled \"*Video Games*.\" The box wasn't taped very well, so I peek into the box and I'm seeing some serious video games. I'm seeing Final Fantasy 7-9 black label, a mint copy of Illusion of Gaia. Like, what girl even knows what that game is!? So I ask, \"Hey, is this a box of your boyfriend's stuff?\" and she responds with, \"No, I don't have a boyfriend. That stuff's mine so make sure not to drop it.\" So now I know this girl is actually the coolest girl ever.\n\nSo I help the girl move her stuff in and we hang out afterwards. We go out to lunch and we hit it off. We ended up just talking about video games the whole time and it was amazing. Now I have a friend to talk nerd shit with and don't forget, she's a cute as hell 7/10. And I also have this 9/10 girlfriend with me. And again, I'm just a 6/10 so right now, I'm living the dream.\n\nSo a couple weeks go by and my girlfriend comes up to me and says, \"Hey, so this may sound weird, but I don't want you to hang out with that girl anymore. You're spending a lot of time with her and I'm honestly a little jealous and I want you to spend more time with me.\" \n\nI tell her, \"Well listen, why don't you try to talk to her. If you like me, then you'll like her and then we can all hang out and it'll be great.\" She says, \"Well...alright. I guess I'll give it a shot. I'll try to talk to her tomorrow\n\nSo next day, my girlfriend comes up to me and says, \"Uh, yeah you can't see that girl ever again.\" \n\n\"Wait, what? Why not? What happened?\"\n\n\"Yeah she told me that you're hers now and if I ever go near you again, she is going to kill me.\"\n\n\"I think you're overreacting a little bit. She doesn't seem like that type of person\"\n\n\"She told me, and I quote, that she is going to *fucking murder me*.\"\n\n\"I can't imagine that it's that serious. I'll try to straighten this out and go talk to her tomorrow.\"\n\nI go up to 7/10's house the next day and give it a little knock on the door but nobody answers. I try the doorbell, nothing. Give her a call, text her, no answer. So then I call my girlfriend, try to tell her that she wasn't there and I'll try again tomorrow. But again, no answer. So I go over to her house, knock on the door and still no answer. Next day knock* knock* no answer and I don't know what's going on.\n\nSo day after day goes by and eventually, week after week and I'm getting nothing. I put in the missing persons but nothing turns up. I call their family and friends and they know nothing. And after weeks of all this, I just give up.\n\nThen I turn the news on one day, and I see the 7/10 girl getting carried away in handcuffs. And, she's covered in blood from head to toe. She's screaming and yelling at the camera saying, \"She's dead, you're next.\" A couple days go by and the autopsy reports are coming in, and its all over the internet. Apparently, not only did she kill my gorgeous 9/10 girlfriend, but parts of her were missing. Chunks of her arms and legs were gone and it seems that the 7/10 girl ate parts of my girlfriend. Bit and chewed into her.\n\nNow I'm thinking to myself that I had the two most amazing girls in my life. And I'm here, 6/10, just worried out of my mind because I can't get the image out of my head of her screaming into the cameras saying, \"She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next.\" And I'm going crazy, I'm screaming and writing it in blood on the walls, \"She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next.\" AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO DO ANYMORE. \n\nAnd it raises the question: Why is 6 afraid of 7?",

At 8pm every night, Ted would receive a visit from one of his other regulars - Champ, a stray dog who always came for a bowl of water and a few bags of pork scratchings. The regulars all loved Champ, and he was treated like the pub's mascot. \n\nOne night just before 8pm, there was a screech of brakes outside the pub, shortly followed by a man running into the pub in a state of distress. \n\n\"This dog, it just ran out in front of my car...I think I've killed it!\"\n\nTed immediately feared the worst, and sure enough when he went outside, it was the heavily mangled remains of Champ in the middle of the road. Only Champ's tail remained intact. \n\nTed and the other regulars were in shock, but soon decided that they should have some kind of tribute to such a well-loved regular of the pub. \n\n\"Why don't we get his tail stuffed, and hang it above the bar?\" suggested one of the regulars. This was thought to be a great idea, and shortly after a taxidermist was called and Champ's tail was stuffed.\n\nOn New Year's Eve that year, Ted was having a quiet drink after having closed the bar at the end of a successful evening. All of a sudden, he heard some scratching noises coming from the front door. \"That sounds like Champ!\" thought Ted, but one glance at the tail above the bar told him it couldn't be. He looked into his drink, shook his head and carried on drinking. \n\n10 minutes later, he heard the same scratching noises. This time, he couldn't shake off his curiosity and made his way to the front door. When he opened the door, he recoiled with a huge fright; there in front of him was the ghost of Champ on the door step, looking up at him. \n\n+I'd like my tail back, please+ came this voice inside his head.\n\n\"I...I...I can't d-d-d-do that!\" stuttered Ted. \n\n+I'd like my tail back, please+ repeated the ghostly form of Champ. \n\n\"I can't do that\" replied Ted, having overcome his original shock. \n\n+I have come seeking the return of my tail. I cannot transition through to the afterlife in such an incomplete state. Why can I not have my tail back?+ insisted Champ. \n\nTed glanced at the clock. It was now 3:30am. \n\n\"I'm sorry, but we can't retail spirits at this time of night.\"",

The king replied by telling him that he had to shove the berries inside him, and if he made any expression, he would be eaten. \"This'll be easy, they're just small berries, they can fit.\" The man fit eight berries into his ass when he burst out laughing. Because he broke the rules of the king's test, he was eaten as well.\n\nThe first man and the second man met in heaven, and started talking about the king's test.

If you lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man.\" \"OK,\" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old, and entered the house. \n\nDuring dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful, and had a fantastic body. She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. During the night, he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet, so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy. \n\nHe woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes, he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, \"Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest.\" \"Well, that's pretty crappy,\" he thought.\"If that's the best the old man can do, then I don't have much to worry about.\" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window, and threw the boulder out. \n\nAs he did so, he noticed another note on it that read, \"Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle.\" In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. \n\nAs he plummeted towards the ground, he saw a large sign on the ground that read, \"Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bed post.\"",

He's having a great time at the festival, and he sees a strikingly attractive woman across the way. \n\nHe heads over to her and introduced herself. They start talking, and they hit it off straight away. She is a Kurdish woman, visiting Chicago with her family for the weekend while she is on holiday. He meets all of her extended family, and they all click great! One thing leads to another, and they spend the night together. \n\nThe next day, they return to the concerts and go to see some classic rock. But things go south while they're at the concert; lead singers from two prominent bands also meet his new Kurdish girlfriend, and there's a three-way fight between Mario and the singers. The singers bring the rest of their bands to back them up, and poor Mario gets the ever loving crap kicked out of him. \n\nHe wakes up three days later in the hospital and asks, \"Doctor, what happened?\"\n\nThe doctor tells him, \"it seems you *really* upset Tommy Shaw and Mick Jagger! You're very lucky your girlfriend's family got to you in time! They kept you stable, then rushed you to the hospital! Your collarbone is shattered, your left leg was snapped just above the ankle, and you have a compound fracture in your humerus. Those bands really did a number on you!\"\n\nMario sits there quietly for a moment and then says, \"yeah, they did. It's true what they say, doc. 'Styx and The Stones may break my bones, but Kurds will never hurt me!'\"",

Of course, the vendor gives him what he asks for, and, like the day before, he goes on his way, munching away as he goes.\n\n The rabbit soon becomes a regular, but oddly only ever asks for one of those two toasties. He quickly strikes up a friendship with the vendor, who eventually starts seeing the rabbit almost as a human.\n\n After a few months of daily toastie-buying, the rabbit predictably comes in and asks again for \"one of those fahn-tahstic cheese an' onion toasties\". The vendor rushes to comply.\n\n Only, today he has a problem. It's the end of the week - and it's been a busy one, at that. There's no more onions for the rabbit's cheese and onion toastie, nor is there any bacon for his beloved bacon and bean. \n\nThe vendor knows he has to give the rabbit something, so he quickly knocks up a cheese and bean toastie - one of the sandwich bar's best-selling products. As usual, the rabbit thanks the vendor and leaves, happy as can be.\n\n The rabbit doesn't turn up the next day. Nor does he turn up the day after. Soon, the vendor becomes worried, but just assumes that the rabbit moved away, or lost his cravings for toasties.\n\n Finally, a week after the rabbit disappeared, the vendor sees the rabbit's pale ghost float through the door and up to the bar.\n\n \"Y-you're dead!\", exclaims the vendor, shocked. \"W-what the hell happened?\"\n\n \"Ah think it was your fault, mah friend\", explains the rabbit, \n\n\"For mixin'-mah-toasties\"",

This time he asked \"What is 9 minus 5?\" \nThe blonde replied \"2.\"\nAll of the blondes were in an uproar now. They wanted desperately to be able to prove themselves to the world. \"Give her another try, give her another try!\" they shouted.\nSteve decided to give the blonde a question that she could not possibly mess up. \"What is 2 plus 2?\" he asked.\n\"4,\" she replied.\nAt this, all of the blondes began crying and rose to their feet. \n\"Give her another try, give her another try!\"",

After years of begging from me and pressure from his colleagues, i was finally allowed to attend a very nice coed high school. The only rule was that i had to keep avoiding anything Haram. Being free for the first time i started to celebrate. Ate bacon my first day, had Hindu friends in a week, and within the month i had even met a girl. I was shy and awkward as i could possibly be but she liked me and thought i was funny. She was a little too hipster punk for me, listing to music i've never heard and using words like tubular and bae, but i loved it. Within two months we were dating. It was going great until my father heard about it. The Hindus and bacon he could overlook, but the women to him were really wrong. To him this was too much and he even claimed me of having sex with her. As if it couldn't get any weirder he actually demanded i show him my penis to prove i haven't been having sex. I had to ask him twice to make sure i heard him right. It was awkward but living under his roof i had to do as he commands. I started to go out with her on dates and every time i came home i had to whip it out for dad. It might be insane, but i actually am ok with dicks out for haram bae.\n",

You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realise you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you.'\n    The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know the defence attorney?'\n    She again replied, 'Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster, too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. One of them was your wife. Yes, I know him.'\n    The defence attorney nearly died.\n    The judge asked both counsellors to approach the bench and, in a very quiet voice, said,\n    'If either of you idiots asks her if she knows me, I'll send you both to the electric chair.",

Now Mike, it was rumored, possessed ample ability to satisfy any female, and he wasn't very bright. So the zoo administrators thought they might have a solution. Perhaps they could entice Mike to satisfy the female gorilla.  \n\n So he was approached with a proposition: would he be willing to screw the gorilla-for five hundred bucks? Mike replied that he might be interested, but would have to think the matter over. The following day, Mike announced that he would accept their offer, but only under three conditions:   \n\"First,\" he said, \"I don't want to have to kiss her,\" and   \n\n\"Second, I want nothing to do with any offspring that may result from this union.\" The zoo administration quickly acceded to these conditions, but what could be the third?   \n\n\"Well,\" said Mike, \"You've gotta give me another week to come up with the five hundred bucks.

What you do is you hold it in your hand, and when your wife is sleeping you whisper what you want in her ear, and the next day she'll give it to you.\"\n\nThat sounded good, so the man bought the shrunken head, and that night after she fell asleep he whispered the words \"Hot, passionate sex,\" into her ear. The next day went by normally, but that evening when he started to kiss her she went along, and they wound up having the best sex since their wedding night.\n\nShe fell asleep before he did, and he figured that the head worked so well that he'd see what else he could get her to do. He grabbed it again and whispered into her ear.\n\n\"A blowjob.\"\n\nSure enough, the next night before the went to bed, they started fooling around again, and without him even asking she undid his belt, dropped his pants, and gave him an amazing blowjob. After she went to sleep again, he picked up the head, and decided to try for something that she had never let him do before.\n\n\"Anal.\"\n\nJust as before, they started fooling around before they went to bed, and when he rolled her over and starting fucking her in the ass she didn't complain. That night, feeling that he'd gotten a pretty good deal, he went to sleep without whispering anything into her ear.\n\nThe next day he found himself going to an expensive jewelry store to buy a necklace for his wife. After all, she deserved it, didn't she? The night ended without anything happening, though, so he went looking for his shrunken head, but couldn't find it. He had to go to sleep without it, and after work the next day he thought to himself that he should get his wife a new car. He brought it home and she was thrilled, but again when he tried to get passionate with her that night she said she had a headache. He looked for the shrunken head again, but it was nowhere to be found.\n\nThe husband started to get suspicious, so he tried to stay awake as long as he could while pretending to sleep. She was too patient, though, so he quietly up his phone to record while he was sleeping, worried about what she would make buy next, because between the necklace and the car he was already broke.\n\nSure enough, he fell asleep, and the next moment he frantically listened to the recording, trying to figure out how he was going to pay for whatever she wanted. He got to the part where he heard her whispering something, and turned volume way up so that he could hear it.\n\n\"Justice for Harambe\"\n",

I posted an ad in a local Facebook group selling some of our old biological samples in the Group's surplus sale. The ad reads as follows.\n\nI have the heart of a small boy... $20 Grand Rapids, MI (49504)\n\nIn a jar....on my table. LOTS of biological samples including a heart, spiders, tapeworms, and an octopus. Excellent for a young person who wants to grow up to be a vet/biologist, or for scaring the living hell out of your soon to be ex wife. The Geek Group's Nerd Surplus Sale is being hosted at 902 Leonard NW, 49504, doors open at Noon.\n\nAnd I posted a pic with it. The pic is of the preserved heart floating in a jar.\n\nOf course, this is the internet, and, well....half of the people who come across it will have below average intellect. And I got this comment.\n\n\"Valerie C. First or all why do you have this I'm sure its illegal for you to have him an remains in your home\"\n\nWell......now this is just too much fun......\n\nSo, I replied, with this.....\n\nValerie, I\u2019m glad you asked. It\u2019s time I told the story.\n\nMany years ago, my parents were quite poor. My dad owned a root vegetable farm growing potatoes, beets, turnips, rutabaga and such. My mom worked at the nursing home in town. We lived outside of Coopersville, a little farming town west of here in the nothing between Grand Rapids and Grand Haven. They had nothing, and their life was not an easy one.\n\nAs the leaves fell and they brought in the harvest of \u201874 my mom found out she was pregnant, with twins. If you\u2019ve ever worked around nurses, well, this is like Christmas on a daily basis. They have baby rabies and go nuts over such things. Presents, a shower, it\u2019s a whole thing. And TWINS no less, oh my god. My dad and his best friend build an addition on to the house, and builds a nursery with his own tools and his own hands.\n\nOn a beautiful spring morning, Saturday, May-31-1975 Peg (my mother) gives birth to a pair of healthy boys. 10 fingers, 10 toes, and the only way to tell them apart is one never shuts up, and one never makes a sound. They name the loudmouth Christopher (hi there), and the quiet one Peter.\n\nWe grew up typical american farm kids. Running in the fields, playing in the mud, poor but happy. My parents made sure we were fed and clothed and we were never want for anything. A simple life in a quiet town in a world before the internet. Summers on our bikes, and winters trudging the snow. We lived the kind of life where our idea of high entertainment was jumping out of the barn loft into the haystacks. Through all of it, we were inseparable. We did everything together.\n\nThrough all of it, Peter never really said a word. He wasn\u2019t mute, he COULD talk, he just chose not to, especially around people. I was gregarious, a natural performer and always the center of attention. I\u2019ve been the king of any room I walked into since I was a teenager. Peter, was always there, but always in my shadow. He seldom made a sound, and he spoke so rarely that I could count his vocabulary on my fingers. We called him \u201cMy quiet half\u201d.\n\nStill, this was our \u201cnormal\u201d, and none of us really thought anything of it. We were 80\u2019s kids, and medicine by today's standards was stone knives and bearskins.\n\nIn the late summer of 1991 we were helping with the harvest. To grow up on a farm is to be born into a life of strong muscles and an appreciation for hard work. We were harvesting Turnips, which are very dense and a full hopper weighs over 20 tons. Because of this they lurch and jump and twitch their way across the field. You\u2019ve seen these being pulled behind tractors, they look like an upside down pyramid with a wheel on the side and a little hatch, and have an open top piled high with corn or whatever. We had 5 of them in a line behind an old International Harvester hydrostatic drive tractor.\n\nI was driving the tractor across 60th from the West paddock (where we kept the cows) into the east field where we made the turn to go back to the drop pit to load the big truck that would haul all the turnips off to the broker that we sold them to. Pete was riding the pin and would release the load at the right time, one hopper after another, as we passed over the big grate. We\u2019d done it a hundred times. It\u2019s not the safest way to do it, but it\u2019s what everyone does, because it\u2019s hours faster than doing it \u201cby the book\u201d.\n\nAs we came over the ditch next to the corner of 60th and Garfield, the trailer jumped and Pete got knocked off. Five trailers, each in turn, brought their wheels across his abdomen and legs. He was shredded from the waist down. If he ever made a sound, I never heard it over the roar of the tractor. I didn\u2019t even known he\u2019d fallen off until I got to the barn and he wasn\u2019t there.\n\nI jumped out of the tractor and ran down the road, I saw him a quarter mile before I got to him, and that was the hardest run I\u2019ve made in my life. From the waist up he looked totally fine, and below\u2026..he looked like he\u2019d sat on a grenade.\n\nIt took half an hour for the ambulance to get all the way out there, but it didn\u2019t matter. There was no way he could survive that. He never cried, or screamed or anything. He simply whispered one word.\n\n\u201cSorry\u201d\n\nSeptember 26th, 1991 was when half of me died, my brother, my Twin. My quiet half, silenced forever.\n\nIn the process of cleaning him off the road, hauling him to the hospital, and all of the circus that goes with that, one of the Dr\u2019s noticed that his heart was unusual. The left Atrium and Ventricle were about 3 times the size of the right. The right half of his heart was perfectly normal. The left had formed so large as to displace his lungs and his vocal cords. It was then that we learned that talking for Pete wasn\u2019t just difficult, it was incredibly painful. We never knew. It was a simple birth defect, and today it would be easily treated, even without surgery. But back then, for simple farm folk, we never thought a thing of it. Think about it, do you know how big your heart is?\n\nHold your fists together. It\u2019s about that big. Behind your sternum, and just a little to your left.\n\nPete, through a miracle of mortuary science, had a totally normal funeral with a half-open casket. Most of the people who came had no idea that there wasn't really anything under the closed half, but I had to take a peek after. I lifted the lid and, while I don\u2019t know what the hell I expected to see, I wasn\u2019t prepared for what I found. He was completely dressed, but the pants stopped just under his butt (about 2 inches past where you could see with the top half open). With only the top door open he looked totally normal. But open the lower half, and his pants were rolled up into little bundles and tucked neatly under him, where his legs would have started. Where his legs should have been, were just a series of jars. They had to bury as much of him as they could find, but they couldn\u2019t put him back together, or didn\u2019t take the time. It wasn\u2019t as if he was going to get sewn back together be heal up or something. So most of his organs and such were in jars, sitting where his legs would have been. It wasn\u2019t gross or anything, just simple glass jars with things floating in them.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I did it. But I had the whole place to myself, and I reached in, and picked up the jar holding his heart. I quietly closed the lid, said goodbye to my brother, and took it home with me.\n\nI hid it, on the shelf in my closet, for years.\n\nMy mom came across it once, I told her it was from school for a science project and she said \u201cIew, gross\u201d and went on with her day. Nothing was ever said about it after that, just another in the massive collection of weird things that was my room as a teenager.\n\nAs I write this, it\u2019s 2016, and I have years on my back forty-one. Pete\u2019s heart has been with me through my first love, college, and building a wild dream into a global empire. My quiet half. It\u2019s time to let him go and make his own impact on the world.\n\nPete can live on, far longer than I will really, his giant heart will pass from student to student. Biological samples like this tend to never be actually opened. They are studied through the glass, and spend decades sitting on a shelf. Properly preserved his heart will remain intact for a hundred years after mine is turned back into fertile soil.\n\nAnd that is the story of how I came to have the heart of a small boy, in a jar, on a table.\n\nOr it could be that it\u2019s a sheep\u2019s heart that I got from a high school years ago with all the rest of those biological samples and we\u2019re simply selling them to make space for new demonstrations and gear. It could be that I just made all of this up because it\u2019s a nice quiet morning and perhaps I just like to mess with people that get all indignant on the internet.\n\nAnd you believed it.\n\nWhat\u2026.did you just fall off the fucking Turnip truck or something?\n",

He says they're welcome to use any of the vehicles & equipment on the base to escape to Kuwait, and if they make it to the border they're free to go as his men will not shoot over it. The catch is, they get a 5 minute head start before the full might of the Iraqi army starts hunting them.\n\nSo the Englishman says \"I'll take that turbocharged jeep\", the Iraqis turn their backs while the Englishman jumps in the jeep & speeds off towards the border. 5 minutes later Saddam sends an attack helicopter which easily catches him up & blows him to bits.\n\nThe Scotsman then thinks for a moment and says \"I'll use that helicopter\" so the Iraqis turn their backs as he jumps in the attack helicopter that got the Englishman & speeds off towards the border. 5 minutes later they launch a surface to air missile that blows the Scotsman out of the sky.\n\nSmugly, the Iraqis turn to the Irishman and say \"Well? What do you want?\" To which the Irishman replies \"I'll have a duck and 4 springs, please.\" The Iraqis are puzzled, but they round up the stuff, give it to the Irishman and turn their backs. 5 minutes later there's no sign of him at all. Saddam launches everything to hunt him, to no avail.

The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.\n\nThe elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.\n\nTwenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.\n\nRemembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.\n\nProbably wasn't the same fucking elephant.",

        "body": "when there was a terrible accident. The fire in his forge had gone out of control and set fire to the shop. The blacksmith nearly lost his life. He was bedridden for many months and relied on the help of his children and grandchildren to feed him, bathe him, and take care of all of his needs. Eventually he was able to get back on his feet, though his outlook on life had turned quite grim. He was now able to take care of himself, but he had lost much of his strength and dexterity from the injuries he sustained and he was unable to practice his trade. He fell into a deep depression and he spent most of his days sitting at home in front of the fireplace gazing into the flames, longing for the days when his strong hands could grasp a hammer and strike a hot piece of iron, slowly forging it into a beautiful piece of work. \n\nOne evening when the old man was sitting in front of the fire, he heard a knock at the door. It was his granddaughter, whom he hadn't seen in many months. She had overheard her father talking to her mother about how her grandfather was slowly slipping away into depression and hopelessness and she wanted to help. To the old man's surprise, she had brought him a puppy. \"I thought that since you're always here all by yourself that you might want someone you keep you company,\" the granddaughter said. The old man's eyes welled up with tears and the little puppy instantly jumped into his arms and began licking the tears from his face. The old man and his granddaughter spent the next several hours sitting on the floor of his house watching the puppy chase around a rubber ball, bouncing, jumping, panting, and licking. In that short time, the old man had made complete turnaround from being sad, lonely, and hopeless, to smiling from ear to ear, full of joy with his new-found companion. As the hours grew late and the puppy grew tired, the granddaughter said \"Well Opa, I'm glad you like your puppy, but it's late and I should be heading home. By the way, what are you going to call him?\" \"Life,\" said the old man, \"because he has given me a new meaning and joy to mine.\" The granddaughter kissed her grandfather on the cheek, wished him goodnight, and she left. \n  \nMany years passed and all the while, the old man and his little dog were inseparable. Everywhere the old man went, Life was always with him whether it was the post office, the grocery store, and even when the old man went to the barber shop, the little dog would sit patiently until the last hair on the old man\u2019s head had been cut . The granddaughter would often come to visit to see how her grandfather and the dog were doing, and she was always glad to see that her grandfather was still happy. But at night, the old man would still sit in front of the fireplace with Life on his lap, gazing into the fireplace as flames cast dancing shadows across the room and he fell asleep to thoughts of his old smithing days. \n  \nOne morning as the old man was getting the morning newspaper from the front porch, Life sprinted past him through the front door because he had spotted a squirrel across the street. Before the little dog could catch up with his prey, a speeding car struck the poor animal. The car came to a screeching halt and the old man hobbled as quickly as his old legs could carry them to his precious companion who lay whimpering on the side of the road. The little dog was alive but badly injured. The man who was driving the car got out to apologize to the old man, but his regrets went unnoticed by the weeping old man who only wanted to tend to his injured dog. Life\u2019s two hind legs appeared limp and broken and the dog panted and whimpered as the old man carried him back into the house. The old man knew that his dog\u2019s injuries required medical attention but because he was out of work, he wasn\u2019t able to afford a veterinarian. Determined, the old man did the only thing he knew how to do. He found some of his old blacksmithing tools and scrap metal from his garage and proceeded to start a fire in his fireplace. His hands lacked the strength and precision they once had but eventually, he was able to forge a crude set of brackets that would hold the dog\u2019s legs in place as his injuries healed. The old man tended to dog\u2019s every need until eventually, Life was able to stand up on his own and soon enough, the dog could walk, and after a few more weeks, he could even manage a awkward, limping run. Unfortunately, the old blacksmith\u2019s craftsmanship was lacking due to his own previous injuries and the braces that he had forged would often break when the dog ran too quickly, so the old man found himself back at the fireplace with his tools forging replacement parts for his little dog\u2019s leg braces. It was tiresome, difficult work with his old frail hands, but he was determined to give his dog the best life that he could, so he kept at it. \n  \nOne day, as the old man was forging a new set of parts for his dog\u2019s leg braces, an ember jumped from the fireplace, catching the carpet on fire. The old man couldn\u2019t get to the kitchen quickly enough to get a pail of water to put the fire out and tragically, the old blacksmith and his dog both perished as the house was engulfed in flames. \n  \nThe next day, the granddaughter and her father came to where the old blacksmith\u2019s house once stood and they began to search through the ashes and rubble for anything they could salvage as a keepsake of their lost loved one. \u201cYou know,\u201d said the girl to her father, \u201cI\u2019m really happy that grandpa\u2019s last years were as joyful as they were. Even though he was really sad that he couldn\u2019t make a living as a blacksmith anymore, he really did seem happy after I brought him that puppy.\u201d \u201cYes dear,\u201d said the father. The daughter continued, \u201cBut isn\u2019t it sad how his house was burnt down when he was making one of those leg braces for his dog?\u201d The father looked down and picked up a small piece of metal from the ashes and said \u201cThat\u2019s one of Life\u2019s little iron knees.\u201d \n",

The sounds he creates are incredible and irreplaceable.\n  Tragically, one day the legendary bell ringer dies, and the entire village is at a loss. The head monk of the bell tower decides that the only way to replace the legendary bell ringer is to hold bell ringing trials the day following the bell ringer's death. Every single person queues up at the bottom of the bell tower and rings the bell, but not one of them is able to recreate the beautiful sounds that the legendary bell ringer created.\nAt the end of the day, after everyone has had their trials, the head monk is at a loss. \n  'The legendary bell ringer will never be replaced,' he says, as he hangs his head in shame, whilst sat at the foot of the tower. He had just about given up all hope when there is a tug on his trouser leg. He looks down to see a poor, clearly homeless, man chewing and tugging his trouser leg. The man has no arms, and only had one leg, and lays beraggled on the floor. \n   'What do you want?' the head asks.\n   'I'm here for the bell ringing trials!' the man proclaims. At this point the head monk figures that he may as well give the man a go, even though he had never seen or heard of him before, let alone the fact that he is missing some of his limbs.\n  The head monk orders the man to be carried to the top of the bell tower, as he is unable to pull the rope to ring the bell at the tower's base. The man stands up and hops to the edge of the bell tower. He proceeds to launch himself towards the bell, headbutting it as he passes, and safely landing on the opposing platform.\n  A magical noise echoes throughout the village, one better than ever heard before. The head monk, clearly surprised, gathers all of the village people to show off the village's new, if strange, bell ringer. He requests all to surround the tower, and hundreds of people fill the streets that evening to hear the new sounds.\n  The homeless man is once again carried up the tower, and stands on the edge of the bell tower. Again, he launches himself towards the bell, but he misjudges the leap, and subsequently falls to his death in front of the entire village.\n  A number of people proceed to cry out and surround the body, before the local enforcement remove the body and take the head monk into detention for questioning. They sit him down to interview him, to make sure that there is no foul play at hand. The interview begins and the head monk is calm, although distraught.\n  'So, to begin... did you know this man?

He has a long trip coming up soon and knows that she is going to cheat on him if he doesn't do something. So he has decided to purchase her a female masterbatory aid to stop her cheating ways.\n\nAfter explaining all of this to his wife, she tells him that she is extremely excited at the idea and urges him to go and pick out something for her.\n\nAs he is scanning the dildo wall of his local porn store he shakes his head and clearly not finding anything he thinks she would like, he turns to leave.\n\nHowever, the Jamaican man behind the counter stops him.\n\n\"Oy! Come down o'r here boy. Me thinks I be havin sum tin you want.\"\n\nThe Husband, caught off guard walks over to the counter as the fellow places a simple wooden box on the counter and flops it open. \n\nInside is a rather plain average sized dildo. The husbands face contorts with disbelief and meets the Jamaican mans gaze. \n\n\"What's so special about this one? That one on the wall over there is 24 inches.\" He explains, gesturing behind him.\n\nThe shop keep smiles and speaks in a low tone. \n\n\"Dis, be da Voodoo dick mon. You tell de dick what to do. And it do it.\"\n\nThe husband lets out a laugh. \"Yeah, sure it does.\" He shakes his head and turns to leave.\n\n\"Stop!\" The Jamaican says. \"I be showing you! Voodoo dick! Fuck the doll!\" The shop keep points at one of the several full sized sex dolls propped up against one wall.\n\nTo the husbands amazement, the dildo leaps out of the box, floats over to the doll and begins fucking it.\n\nThe husbands jaw drops open as he can't believe what he is seeing. \"I'll take it!\" He exclaims and quickly pulls out his credit card \"How much?\"\n\nAfter a few minutes of negotiation the man pays. The Shop keeper leans in close as he hands him his receipt.\n\n\"One mor ting mon. You haf to be tellin the Voodoo Dick 'back in your box' or it not be stopping. The man nods.\n\n\"Voodoo Dick! Back in your box!\" He says, and the dildo stops fucking the doll, floats over and lands in its box. The man is over joyed. \n\nBack at his house the husband explains his shopping experience with his wife who nods and smiles eagerly during the entire exchange. He tells her everything except how to \"turn it off\", then rushed out of the house to catch his flight.\n\nA few days later the wife, feeling extremely frisky. Starts thinking of all of the men should can call over to quench her appetite when she remembers the Voodoo Dick. \n\nSo figuring she has nothing to loose, she gets undressed, grabs the box with the dildo in it, opens it and says; \"Voodoo Dick! Fuck my pussy.\" \n\nThe dildo leaps to obey. \n\nAfter throughly enjoying herself, the wife decides she has had enough and reaches down to stop the dildo from continuing, yet it does not cease. \n\nShe begins to panic. Try as she might, she simply cannot get the thing to stop pounding her. Having no other options, she dons a heavy trench coat and rushed out to her car, with the intention of driving to the hospital.\n\nOn the way, Voodoo Dick is still going at it. Causing the wife to swerve occasionally whenever another orgasm  strikes her. \n\nSeeing the erratic driving a cop flips on his lights and chased the wife down. Pulling her over the cop asks what's going on? The wife, still being drilled by Voodoo Dick tries to explain the whole thing.\n\nThe cop shakes his head and says; \"Yeah right. Voodoo Dick my ass!\" \n\n\nNot my joke. But funny! :)\n\nAs per usual, I uploaded in my phone. Sorry for horrible grammar. \n",

He goes to the camel dealer and asks if he has any camels that can make it that far.  The camel dealer says, \"Yes, I have two six day camels.\"  The man selects the best looking one and buys it.  As he leaves, the dealer calls out \"Make sure you fill him all the way up!\"\nThe man takes the camel to the river and lets the camel drink until he can't drink anymore.  Then he sets out across the desert.  After three days, the camel dies of thirst.  The man could have gone either way, but he was really pissed at the camel dealer, so he walked back the way he came, barely surviving the journey.  He stomps up to the camel dealer and yells, \"You son of a bitch!  I paid for a six day camel, and you sold me one that only lasted three days!\"  The camel dealer says, \"No, that was a six day camel!  You must not have filled him up all the way!\"  The man says, \"I let him drink until he could not drink any more!  He was full!\"  The dealer says, \"OK, I think I see the problem.  Come to the river with me and I will show you how to fill a six day camel.\"\nSo the dealer gets the other six day camel and they go down to the river.  The dealer leads the camel to the water and lets him drink his fill.  Just before the camel is done drinking, he sneaks behind the camel and slams the camel's nuts between two rocks.  The camel goes [at this point I have to explain this is a verbal joke, there is a critical sound effect.  Make a surprised groan, but instead of pushing air out past your vocal cords, suck air in as you make the sound.  Try it now so you get it.] \"OOOOOH\"\n[at this point people laugh and think the joke is over].  \nThe man says, \"Good God!  Doesn't that hurt?\"  The dealer says, \"Not unless you get your fingers between the rocks.\"\n\nThe Bus Full of Nuns\nA bus full of nuns is on its way to Rome to meet the Pope.  A tire blows out and the bus veers off a cliff and falls 500 feet, killing all the nuns instantly.  The nuns wake up and they are in a line in front of Saint Peter's Gate.  The gates are closed, and Saint Peter is standing before the gate.  The first nun steps up to Saint Peter and says, \"I have lived a life devoted to God and I have not sinned.  Let me in!\"  Saint Peter replies, \"We have had some sinners dressing up in nun costumes before committing suicide, so you need to pass a test before entering.\"  The nun says, \"OK, go ahead.\"  Saint Peter asks, \"What was the name of the first man in the Garden of Eden?\"  The nun answers, \"That is easy!  It was Adam!\"  BING, a bell goes off, the gates swing open, the nun marches in, and the gates close.  The second nun steps up.  Saint Peter asks, \"What was the name of the first woman in the Garden of Eden?\"  The nun answers, \"That is easy!  Her name was Eve!\" BING, a bell goes off, the gates swing open, the nun marches in, and the gates close.  The third nun steps up.  Saint Peter asks, \"What were the first words Eve said to Adam in the Garden of Eden?\"  The third nun is stunned.  She scratches her head, screws up her eyes, then says \"Jesus!  That is a hard one!\"  BING, a bell goes off, the gates swing open, the nun marches in....",

(Man, I could really go for a good game of Scrabble right now if anybody's interested.)\n\nAnyway, she didn't say anything about playing Scrabble on our cellphones. Instead, she pulled out a pen from her purse and started scribbling on a napkin. Pretty soon, I see she's challenged me to a game of Hangman!\n\nOkay, it's no Scrabble, but whatever, I'm game.\n\nAfter a few lucky guesses, I got all of the letters except one, but it was getting late and I had to cut it short to make the D train otherwise I'd be waiting all night for the next one. She said she would like to come with me on the D train so we could finish playing, but I told her that wouldn't be fair since she's way on the other side of town and her ride home would be a real pain in the ass. She said she didn't mind at all and that she could use a little pain in the ass to make things more interesting, but I think she was just being polite.\n\nI felt bad because I realized this girl really likes word games just as much as I do, if not more. I was starting to feel a little sweet on her since we have similar interests and we get along really well. I'm really competitive, but in that moment I was willing to throw the game for her just to make her happy, so I told her her I'd make one last quick guess and then I really had to catch my train. With a wry little smirk, she said \"I bet you're pretty well hung.\" Wrong move, lady! She was right: I only had one guess left before the hangman got me! Now she had poked the bear! I never back down from a challenge!\n\nSo, I told her I would take that bet and I immediately bet her one hundred dollars! She was shocked. Clearly, she underestimated me. Turns out, she didn't want to bet money, so I came up with a friendly wager instead. I told her the loser buys the winner a beer. She said in that case I should buy her a beer right now! More smack talk!\n\n\"We'll see who has the last laugh,\" I said. I folded up the napkin and I told her to keep it in her purse until next time. She threw it back at me and told me to shove it up my ass. This chick is possibly even more competitive than me! I think I've found my soulmate, fellas!\n\nAnyway, I've been staring at this for a long time now... \n\nIt's a real head-scratcher: \n\n    _________                    \n    |        |           G F K Q V Y      \n    |        0           B L M R U Z   \n    |       /|           X C J O P \n    |       / \\\n    |\n    | \n\n    SHE WANTS THE _\n\n\n\nEDIT: LULZ",

If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man.\"\n\n\"Ok,\" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house.\n\nBefore dinner, the daughter came down the stairs.

He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn he crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy.\n\nHe woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, \"Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest.\"\n\n\"Well, that's pretty crappy,\" he thought. \"If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about.\" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: \"Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle.\"\n\nIn a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder.\n\nAs he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, \"Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost.\"",

What do you want for your second wish?\"\n\nCinderella looked down at her frail body, and said, \"I wish I were young and full of the beauty and youth I once had.\"\n\nAt once, her wish became reality, and her beautiful young visage returned - and Cinderella felt stirrings inside her that had been dormant for years.\n\nThen the fairy godmother spoke once more: \"You have one more wish; what shall it be?\"\n\nCinderella looked over to the frightened dog in the corner and said, \"I wish for you to transform Bob, my old dog, into a kind and handsome young man.\"\n\nMagically, Bob suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his biological make-up that, when he stood before her, he was a man so beautiful the likes of him neither she nor the world had ever seen.\n\nThe fairy godmother said, \"Congratulations, Cinderella, enjoy your new life.\" With a blazing shock of bright blue electricity, she was gone as suddenly as she appeared.\n\nFor a few eerie moments, Bob and Cinderella looked into each other's eyes. Cinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most beautiful, stunningly perfect man she had ever seen.\n\nThen Bob walked over to Cinderella, who sat transfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his young, muscular arms.

Obviously confused, the scientists decided to research what could be causing the mass deaths of these birds. After a few weeks of research they found out that almost all of the birds were being killed by motorcyclists. Instead of helping, this information just confused the scientists more. So they decided to carry on their investigation. After a few more weeks the scientists discovered something truly amazing,  when the birds found a carcass on the side of the road two birds would go to eat it while another kept watch for predators or vehicles approaching. This, the scientists found, was why so many crows were dying. It's very easy for a crow to say \"Caww\" but it's difficult for them to pronounce \"Motorcycle\".  ",

He agreed, but he didn't say much.\n\nI asked him what was wrong; He said, \"nothing.\" \n\nI asked him if it was my fault that he was upset. \n\nHe said he wasn't upset, that it had nothing to do with me, and not to worry about it.\n\nOn the way home, I told him that I loved him. \n\nHe smiled slightly, and kept driving.  I can't explain his behavior. \nI don't know why he didn't say, 'I love you, too.'\n\nWhen we got home, I felt as if I had lost him completely, as if he wanted nothing to do with me anymore. He just sat there quietly, and watched TV. He continued to seem distant and absent.\n\nFinally, with silence all around us, I decided to go to bed. About 15 minutes later, he came to bed. But I still felt that he was distracted, and his thoughts were somewhere else. He fell asleep; I cried. I don't know what to do. I'm almost sure that his thoughts are with someone else.

I\u2019m not sure the IRS finds that believable.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m a great gambler, and I can prove it,\u2019 says Grandpa. \u2018How about a demonstration?\u2019\n\nThe auditor thinks for a moment and says, \u2018Okay.

I just knew the guy was in my apartment, but I couldn't find him. I looked everywhere and was just about to give up, when I went out on the balcony of my 23rd story apartment and there he was hanging over the edge! He was just barely hanging on, there was no way he could climb back onto the balcony. It was a really stupid place to try to hide. I was livid, so I started punching him and clawing at his fingers, but he held on. Finally I went to get a hammer and started pounding on his fingers, and he fell down. But what really angered me was that he landed in some bushes and fell to the ground dazed, but basically OK! I was so mad I grabbed the refrigerator, threw it off the balcony and it landed on him. Unfortunately I was so riled up by the incident I had a heart attack and died.\"\n\nSt. Peter was taken aback, and said \"While you did die in a dramatic fashion, I think we need to look at that whole second degree murder before we let you in - off to limbo with you.\" He then approached the second man and asked him how he had died.\n\n\"I was riding my exercise bike on the balcony of my 24th story apartment, when the thing broke and threw me over the railing! I grabbed furiously at the railing and slipped, but managed to catch on the balcony below mine. I tried to climb up but it just wasn't possible. I thought I was going to fall but then someone came out on the balcony. I thought he would help me, until he started hitting me! I held on as best I could, but when he got a hammer and started hitting me I finally couldn't hold on anymore and fell. Somehow, though, I fell in some bushes and fell to the ground dazed, but basically OK! Just as I'm coming around, I look up and BAM this refrigerator lands on me. So here I am.\"\n\nSt. Peter immediately admitted this second man to heaven, and pulled aside the third man and asked him for his story.\n\n\"Picture this: I'm hiding naked in a refrigerator...",

After getting  engaged to the love of his life, he decides to find one. After some searching, he finds one for only $500. Immediately, he calls the owner and sets up a time to come look at the bike. \n\nUpon arrival, Greg meets this old man and asks him about the bike. The old man just smiles as he opens the garage and reveals the Harley in perfect showroom condition. Astonished, Greg asks the man how he kept the bike looking so new. With a chuckle, the old man says, \"it's an old family secret. Every time it's going to rain, I coat every inch of the bike in Vasoline. The water runs right off and keeps the bike looking new.\" Greg gives the man the money and loads the bike up. \n\nAfter getting it home, he starts the bike up and takes off to pick up his fianc\u00e9e to have dinner with her parents, stopping to get some Vasoline for the bike. \n\nWhen they arrive, she stops him at the doorstep and says, \"there's something you need to know about my family. Nobody talks during dinner. Whoever speaks first has to wash all the dishes.\" Greg nods and they go inside. \n\nHe's met with an entryway that has a tiny path leading inside.  On either side of the path are dishes stacked floor to ceiling. As he walks further into the house he sees the living room filled with dishes, floor to ceiling, except for a tiny path to the couch and between the couch and TV. The stairs, the halfway, the rooms, all riddled with dishes floor to ceiling. \n\nWhen dinner starts, everyone sits down and starts eating, and sure enough, nobody says a word. \n\nAbout five minutes in, Greg thinks, *I can have fun with this* and reaches over and grabs his fianc\u00e9e's titty. \n\nThe father glares at him, the mother acts like she didn't see anything, but sure enough, nobody says a word. \n\nDelighted by this reaction, Greg grabs his fianc\u00e9e, throws her on the table, rips off her pants and begins fucking her right in the table. \n\nThe father is fuming, the mother gasps loudly, but... nobody says a word. \n\nGreg sits back down and begins to eat again. After several more minutes, he decides to go even further and reaches over and grabs the mother's titty, throws her on the table, and behind fucking her. \n\nThe father clenched his fists, turns multiple shades of red, veins pop out of his forehead. The anger can be felt for miles. \n\nBut, nobody says a word.\n\nExhausted, Greg begins to eat again, but suddenly hears a loud clap of thunder in the distance. As the old man's words echo in his head, he stands up and pulls out his jar of Vasoline. \n\nSuddenly, the father slams his hands on the table and shouts, \"Alright, enough! I'll do the goddamned dishes! \"",

The teacher let it go for a bit, but then had to take him aside.\n\"You're going to have to do the work like everyone else, Johnny.\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\"Well how are you going to learn to read and write? You need to learn these things to get a job someday.\"\n\n\"Don't need it,\" He replied \"I'll be a cushmaker when I grow up.\"\n\nMs. Patrick didn't want to admit to a 4 year old that she didn't know what a cushmaker was, so she sent him to the principal's office. He gave Johnny a good talking to, but Johnny was adamant.\n\"I don't need to learn this, I'll be a cushmaker when I grow up. Just like my daddy, and his daddy before him.\"\nThe principal decided to let this go, being his first day and all and also not wanting to admit he didn't know what a cushmaker was.\n\nJohnny was pushed along through elementary school and middle school the same way. Every so often, a teacher or administrator tried to reach him, but he was going to be a cushmaker when he grew up. \nWhen he reached high school, one of his teachers couldn't believe he was so far behind.\n\n\"Johnny! What is wrong with you?! You'll never amount to anything if you don't have an education!\"\n\n\"Don't need it, I'll be a cushmaker. Just like my daddy and his daddy before him. I'll be a 6th generation cushmaker.\"\n\nThe teacher had enough and decided to get in touch with his friend who was a US Navy recruiter. Johnny went in to see the recruiter and he asked about Johnny's goals.\n\n\"I'm going to be a cushmaker very soon.\" \n\n\"The Navy can give you the skills you need to be an excellent cushmaker one day.\" The recruiter said. He had no clue what a cushmaker was but he was behind on his quota and was ready to make a deal. Johnny liked this idea and enlisted.\n\nOn Johnny's first day, the chief ordered the new recruits to clean the bunks, Johnny refused. The chief wanted to make an example of Johnny and chewed him out good.\n\n\"You think you're special son?!\"\n\n\"I'm here to get better at cushmaking, this won't help my abilities!\"\n\nHe got reported to the superior officers, but for awhile Johnny had enough charisma to slide by. He didn't do much work, and everyone who confronted him got the same response. One day an Admiral was touring the ship and noticed one bunk untidy and started to question the Captain about it. The Captain explained about the struggles they were having with Johnny. The Admiral was shocked to find them not being able to keep one man in line and summoned Johnny. The Admiral chewed him out and Johnny remained steadfast in his resolve.\n\"I'm just wanting to be a cushmaker, they said the Navy will help me. I'm from a proud line of cushmakers and my children will be too.\"\n\nThe Admiral didn't know what a cushmaker was, but was intrigued by his spirit. \"Son, when will you be ready to be a cushmaker?\"\n\n\"I can start right now, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, if you're going to cushmake, you'll do it for the US Navy, and on the taxpayer's dime. Now what do you need?\"\n\n\"First, I'll need a ship with a deep hull, so I can have a full workshop.\"\n\n\"Can't be on land?\"\n\n\"No sir, has to be on a boat. I'll also need 3,000 sheets of 3/4\" plywood, 200 gallons of rubber cement, and 500 buckets of spackle.\"\n\n\"Done, what else do you need?\"\n\n\"Well sir, I'll need men under my command to move the lumber and mix the chemicals.\"\n\n\"I'll assign you 200 men.\"\n\n\"Thank you sir, I'll get to work right away.\"\n\nJohnny and his team get to work and news of this spreads through out the fleet. The news media starts to learn of it and even the president is intrigued. After a few days, Johnny sends out everyone from the ship and tells the Admiral he will be done in one week. The anticipation builds and everyone comes to the harbor for the big revealing.\n\nJohnny comes out all sweaty and exhausted, he tells the Admiral it's ready. He needs a crane to lift it out of the hull. A crane is brought over and the hook is lowered into the hull. Out comes a perfect white cube. Johnny orders the cube to be lifted and released into the ocean.\n\n*cuuuuuuuuuuuuuuusssssssssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhh*",

He notices the room is walled with tinted glass, but beyond the glass, he can make out fire, brimstone, and shadowed human figures writhing in agony.\n\nWhen Satan comes back over to the newly deceased guy, he says, \"Hey, I hope you're enjoying your first day here. Is there anything I can get for you? Champagne? Cocaine?\"\n\nThe guy shakes his head and says, \"Uh, no, thanks, but I was wondering... what's with all the people out in the fire? They're in agony.\"\n\nSatan ahs and nods. \"Those are the Christians. They wouldn't have it any other way.\"",

The stranger agrees, and the tourist flings himself over the balcony! He rushes past the 12th floor, 11th, 10th...... 9th, 8th floors..... and hits the pavement with a huuuuge splat!\n\nBack upstairs the bartender turns to the stranger and says: \"You know what Superman, you are a real asshole when you're drunk!\"",

He was an incredibly talented man who would challenge people to tell him to play any tune they wanted on any instrument they wanted and he could play the song flawlessly on the spot.

The optometrist having a love of music with his daughter decided he could be a good choice as he could play any music that she wanted at any time.\n\nThe second man's name was Chu Jiang. He was born into an extremely wealthy family who passed down to him an inheritance twenty times greater than the average american's life earnings. He owned many large estates around the world that he could go to on his private airlines and owned large shares of giant companies.  Being an only parent, the optometrist had never been  able to afford much for his daughter and with this man she would never have to worry about money again in her life.\n\nAfter a lot of long hard thinking, the optometrist reached the conclusion that he should give this choice to his daughter as she is the one who will be affected by this decision the most. That night he walked into her room as she was about to go to sleep and said:\n\nYou have two options and I want you to tell me which one looks better for you,\n\nJuan or Chu?\n\nJuan... or Chu?",

He knocked on the door and roused the monks. \"I've got a flat tire. Can I use your phone?\" He asked. \n\nThe monks said they were sorry, but they did not have a phone. \"If you stay tonight, you can get a ride on our wagon into town tomorrow,\" they said. So the man stayed the night, and they put him in a small room in the monastery. \n\nIn the middle of the night, the man was awakened suddenly by a noise. Not just any noise, but the loudest, most wonderful, most terrifying, most hair-raising noise ever. \n\nHe sat there, his heart beating for a few minutes, and he heard it again!Getting out of bed, he went running in the direction of the noise. It came again, making the hair on the back of his neck rise and his skin crawl. Finally, he came to a large door where the head monk was standing. The door was at least 15 feet tall, and made of solid-looking wood and metal. It had chains and bars and locks and a deadbolt on it, and was the most formidable door the man had ever seen. \n\n\"What was that sound?\" He asked. \"What made it? Is it behind that door?\" \n\nThe head monk shook his head. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I can't tell you; you're not a monk.\" \n\nAs the man turned away, he heard the noise again. \"You have to tell me what it is,\" he begged. \n\n\"I'm sorry, I can't tell you, you're not a monk,\" said the monk. \n\nThe man tried to sleep, but couldn't get the noise out of his head. In the morning, as he was getting ready to leave, he heard the sound again. It made his ears ring and his mind whirl.\"Please tell me what made that sound,\" he said.\n\nBut the monks wouldn't. \"I'm sorry, you're not a monk\" was all they said. \n\nThe man left, and eventually got his car fixed and went back to his life. But he couldn't get the sound out of his mind. After a few months, he got in his car and drove and drove until he found the monastery again. He got out of his car and found the head monk. \"I can't forget that sound from that night I was here. Please, please please tell me what made that sound.\" The head monk just shook his head. \n\n\"I can't tell you; you're not a monk,\" he said.\"Then tell me how I can become a monk,\" the man said. \n\nThe head monk said \"It's very difficult. Are you sure you want to do this?\"The man said \"I've got to. I have to know what made that sound.\"The head monk said, \"To join us, you have to perform several tasks. Your first task is to count all of the stars visible in the sky.\" \n\nThe man thought about how hard that would be, but he had to know what made that sound. He sat up every night for a year, counting the stars over and over until he was sure how many stars were visible in the sky. He went to the head monk and told him, and the monk nodded. \n\n\"Very good. Your next task is to count all of the grains of sand on the beaches around the world.\"The man knew this would be even harder, but he could not get the noise out of his head. He had to know what, what kind of animal, could make that terrible horrible mind-bending sound. So he left on his journeys. He crawled the length and breadth of every beach in the world, counting the grains of sand, and he returned to the monastery years later.The head monk heard his answer and nodded. \n\n\"Excellent. You are almost done. Your final task is to climb to the peak of the highest mountain in the world, and see yourself in relation to the rest of creation.\" And the man knew this would be hard, but he outfitted himself, and he went to the highest mountain in the world, and he climbed to the top, and returned months later, older and wiser and more tired than years before when he had first heard the noise, the noise that would not leave his mind and that echoed in his every waking thought.He returned, and the head monk saw that he was wiser, and said \"At last, you are a monk. Come with me.\" \n\nAnd they walked through the monastery, its twisting and turning halls, and as they went the man heard the noise again, over and over, and he was no longer sure if it was the noise or merely his memory of it.And finally, finally, he stood in front of the door and the head monk opened it up, and the man saw what had made the noise. \n\nBut, I can't tell you what it was.

I searched the house but there was no one there except her, so I figured I was wrong. I grabbed a snack from the cupboard and went out onto the balcony of my apartment to clear my head, and sure enough, there's this guy hanging by his fingertips from the edge, trying to stay out of sight. So I look around and see a hammer I'd been using the day before. I snatch it up and start hitting away at his fingers. He quickly falls the twenty stories to the ground and I look over the railing in triumph, but the lucky bastard has landed in some bushes and seems stunned but otherwise fine. In a fit of rage I run inside, pick up my fridge with inhuman strength and hurl it over the balcony and it squashes the adulterous asshole dead. Problem was that the exertion had given me a heart attack, and moments later I found myself here.\"\nSt peter looks aghast, \"That is simply horrible, I'm so very sorry. Please, please come in.\" And the first man enters in to heaven.\n\nThe second man approaches and St Peter gives him the spiel about heaven being full and them only letting in people with tragic deaths.\nThe second man nods and says, \"I was working out on the balcony of my twenty first floor apartment, which has been having renovations done and the railing was down. Not real smart I suppose, but I didn't want to ruin the new carpet with sweat. Anyway I had just finished a set of push ups when my sweaty hands slipped and I fell off the balcony. Luckily I caught the edge of the balcony one story below but because of my work out I was too tired to pull myself up. I cried out for help but no one seemed to hear. Finally someone came out and I thought I was saved but before I could ask for help the manic grabs a hammer and starts beating on my fingers. I fell to what I thought was my death only to be saved by landing in some bushes below. I was climbing free and thanking my lucky stars when out of nowhere a fridge smashes down crushing my legs and stomach. It took a few minutes of agonizing pain, but eventually I bled to death and woke up here.\"\n\"That's awful,\" says St Peter, \"You'd better go in.\"\n\nAnd so the second man enters into heaven. The third man approaches St Peter who tells him the same as the last two. Heaven is full, tragic death's only. But before he can start, St Peter adds, \"and those last two were absolutely horrible. To get in your story is going to have to be really heart wrenching. I mean we've already filled the daily quota. There is almost no chance I can let you in.\"\n\n\"O.K picture this: I'm sitting naked, inside a fridge...\"",

I've never ever been interested in boys or having a relationship with one. I have many guy friends, but I've never been sexually attracted to any of them in any sense of the word, or any male really. I've always been attracted to women. I'd walk down the street, I'd see a woman, and I'd in my head imagine being with her for a night. \n\n\n\nI'm really shy about it, and I never talk about sexuality in open, except with my partner, since I'm really, really shy about it. But I am a very sexual person towards women, I think about almost every woman I come in contact with who is moderately attractive. I was in a relationship with a girl for the past 5 years. I really loved her, I thought we were going to be together forever, I really did. \n\n\n\n\nOver the past year things started to get bumpy, and she really began changing. Her personality changed and she wasn't the girl I fell in love with. She was sometimes becoming really violent and abusive, and the next day would be very meek and apologetic, and then would go back to being angry. I couldn't deal with her anymore, it reached a certain point where I felt... I just didn't care for her anymore as a person. This was going on for a year so when we decided to break up, it was so clear this was what had to happen. She wanted to still 'stay friends'. I was struggling to hold back the tears, but many came through. I refused, I said no, it was over, no friends, no nothing, we're through. \n\n\n\n\nShe got angry, said some really nasty things, I got scared a little, but then it was over. I was just left with my tears. The next few days were terrible, I would spend a lot of the time crying. And this is when it happened. I have one friend, he's really close, he's probably one of my best friends. He's a straight guy, but he's also 22, so he's much younger than me. He knows I'm lesbian and has always been there for me, we've known each other for maybe 2 years, 2 and a half years. \n\n\n\n\nWe haven't known each other that long, but our friendship flourished from the get-go. There was never any romantic tension or sexual sparks between us, he knew I was strictly into women and respected that. We were together at my home, we were talking. When I say we, it was mostly me. I was just going on and on about her, and what she meant to me, and how she hurt me. He kept reassuring me that I did the right decision because she was becoming borderline abusive, but I had convinced myself that I still loved her. He was telling me I shouldn't do this to myself, and I deserve much better. \n\n\n\n\nI was the one who initiated it, it was all me. I don't know what came over me. He was sitting on the couch, and I pressed forward with him, trying to come on to him, trying to kiss him. He was at first resistant and was unsure of what I was doing, he said \"what are you doing\" \"are you sure, you want this.\" I told him \"please, this is what I want\", and then he went with it too. \n\n\n\nI then led him up to the bedroom in my house, things started getting heated and suddenly he asked for some money! I quickly looked again and realized he was an extinct reptile from the Mesozoic era and I was like \"Damnit Loch Ness monster! I ain't givin you no treefiddy!\"",

Little Johnny asked his dad to go into more detail, but his dad told him to go to sleep, so he did. Little Johny wakes up in the middle of the night and decides to go to his parents bedroom becuase he hears some loud snoring, but when he goes there he sees his mom sleeping alone. He heads to his maids room as he hears loud moaning and sees through the keyhole his dad having sex with the maid. He smells something bad coming from his brothers room, only to find his little brother has pooped in his diapers until suddenly he realizes and says, \"OH!

At bedtime when they were preparing to go to bed, he noticed little Johnny was kneeling down beside the bed.

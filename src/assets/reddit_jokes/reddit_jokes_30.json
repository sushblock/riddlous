Upon walking through the door, he was greeted by his wife, who asked about his game.\n\n\"Oh honey, it was awful,\" sighed Chris. \"Glen- you know Glen; Trish's husband?- he had a heart attack and dropped dead on the second hole.\"\n\n\"My God,\" gasped his wife, \"That's terrible! Oh you poor thing.\"\n\n\"Ay, you're telling me. It was awful. For the whole day it was 'hit the ball, drag Glen. Hit the ball, drag Glen.'\"\n________\nA golfing couple were playing their routine course one afternoon. Feeling the peace and serenity of the day, the husband decided to confess his most regrettable action during their marriage.\n\n\"My dear, a few years back, I had an affair with my receptionist. I fired her shortly after. I'm telling you this because I felt guilty, and I know that you're the only one for me.\"\n\nShe remains silent for the remainder of the hole. The husband fear that his marriage is lost. Suddenly, she begins to speak.\n\n\"I too, have something to admit.\"\n\n\"Pray tell,\" says the husband, \"I'm sure it is not as bad as my sins.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she says, \"In the years before we knew each other, I was a man. I've gone through a sex change.\"\n\n\"WHAT?!\" roars the husband. \"AND YOU'VE BEEN HITTING FROM THE WOMEN'S TEE ALL THIS TIME?!\"\n________\nThree men, an avid golf threesome, were considering adding a fourth to their weekly round. That day, a new woman overheard the guys talking about their golf game. She said, \"You know, I used to play on my golf team in college and I was pretty good. Would you mind if I joined you next week?\"\n\nOne of the men said it would be okay, but they would be starting early -- at 6:30 a.m. They figured the early tee-time would discourage her.\n\nThe woman said this may be a problem, and asked if she could be up to 15 minutes late.\n\nThey rolled their eyes, but said okay.\n\nShe smiled and said, \"Good, I'll be there at 6:30 or 6:45.\"\n\nShe showed up at 6:30 sharp, and beat all three of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round. Back at the clubhouse, they congratulated her and invited her back the next week.. She smiled, and said, \"I'll be there at 6:30 or 6:45.\"\n\nThe next week she again showed up at 6:30 sharp. Only this time, she played left-handed. The three guys were incredulous as she still beat them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand. They were totally amazed.\n\nThe third week, the guys showed up with a new intensity to win. But this time, she was 15 minutes late, which made the guys irritable. On this day, the women played right-handed, and narrowly beat all three of them.\n\nBack in the clubhouse, all three guys were shaking their heads. They had a couple of beers, and finally, one of the men asked her point blank, \"How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?\"\n\nThe lady blushed, and grinned. \"That's easy,\" she said..\"When my Dad taught me to play golf, I learned I was ambidextrous. I like to switch back and forth. When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I left in the morning for golf practice, I would pull the covers off him. If his Wee Duff was pointing to the right, I golfed right-handed; if it was pointed to the left, I golfed left-handed.\"\n\nOne of the guys shot back, \"But what if it's pointing straight up?\" \n\nShe said, \"Then, I'm fifteen minutes late.\"\n",

He looked over the options for a few moments before asking the doctor, \"These are pretty great and all, some of the biggest I've ever seen, but I was really hoping for something even a bit larger....\" The doctor agrees to show him his biggest specimens, but warns him that after this last case, they don't get any bigger.\n\nWhen he returned from the back room, the surgeon opened this case to reveal the most enormous phallus the man had ever seen! He gets up and exclaimed, \"Yes! That's exactly the size I wanted!\" But after a few seconds, the doctor notices the man starting to look hesitant. \"Is everything alright? Is it big enough to suit you?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, the size is excellent, but can I ask you a question?\"\n\n\"Of course...\"\n\n\"Well, don't get me wrong, I LOVE how big it is - it's even longer and girthier than I ever could've hoped....\"\n\n\"Well what's the problem?\"\n\n\"It's just...... well........ does it come in white?\"",

There, just over the next sand dune is a house, with vegetation growing around it. \"How do we know that it's not a mirage?\" the second guy skeptically asks. They decide that one of them should go check it out, because they don't have the energy to all go. They do rock-paper-scissors, and the first guy is selected to go see if the house is real.\n\nHe walks over to the house, and decides that it is real. He steps forward and rings the doorbell. After a few moments, the door swings open to reveal the most disgusting, ugly woman the man has ever seen. She has warts and zits all over her butterface, disgusting wrinkly skin, deflated tits, and is generally smelly and dirty. *0/10, would feed to pet alligator*, the first guy thinks, realizing his thinking habits that he picked up on reddit won't do him any good in the desert. \n\nHe holds in a gag, shakes of the dizzying nausea, and says, \"Hello, my friends and I are lost in the desert and are close to death. Is there any way you could give us some water?\" The woman/garbage pile replies \"Of course, but only if you have sex with me.\" The man takes a moment to process what she is saying, and promptly faints, soon standing back up again and getting the hell away from her.

Wanna help us out?\" She again replies, \"Sure, but only if you have sex with me.\" The second guy doesn't have as much self-control as the first guy and projectile vomits all over her front porch. He runs back to his friends, turns towards the third guy, and gasps out, \"You give it a try. You're our only chance.\" The third guy gets up and walks over to the house, following the same procedure as the first two. When the woman says, \"Sure, but only if you have sex with me,\" he cleverly decides that there may be some way of avoiding it, and replies, \"OK.\" She tells him to follow her into the kitchen, because that's where she wants to have sex.\n\nThe guy sees something out of the corner of his eye and says, \"OK, now close your eyes.\" She obliges. He reaches over and grabs a corn-on-the-cob that he saw on the counter, and proceeds to fuck her with it. When she finishes, he tosses it out of the open kitchen window before she sees it. Then she says, \"God, that was the best sex I've ever had. You get the water, but if you do that again, I'll give you guys a car to get out of here.\" He says, \"Why not?\" and tells her to close her eyes, then grabs another cob of corn and screws her with it, tossing it out of the window when she is done. She says, \"If you do that a third time I'll give you gas for the car. It's on empty.\" He instructs her to close her eyes again, and screws her with the corn, throwing this one out of the window as well. She gives him the water and gas, and he loads them into the car, before driving back to where his friends are, only they're not there anymore.\n\nHe drives around everywhere looking for them, and finally circles back around the house. He finds them propped up against the wall, eating. They look up and see him and the first guy says, \"What took you so long, man? You really missed out! We just had the best buttered corn I've ever tasted!\"",

After he's had a few, the man is a little tipsy and getting more and more curious about this bottle full of 50's so he decides to go for it.\n\nThe bartender tells the man that if he completes three tasks, he wins the whole bottle.  The first task was to drink a full cup of vodka without making a face.  The second was to go out into the alley behind the bar and pull a rotten tooth out of the guard dog out there.  Finally, there was an old lady in the upstairs apartment who had never had an orgasm so the third task was to make her cum.\n\nThe man agrees and immediately downs the vodka without a problem.  After this, he stumbles out the back door of the bar to perform the second task.  After about 20 minutes of barking and screaming the man comes back inside, covered from head to toe in bites and scratches and asks the bartender \"alright now where's this old lady who needs her tooth pulled?\" ",

Thanks for asking\" replied the dog. \"I'm having a couple of days off, I've had a bit of a traumatic time. You see, I was over in a war zone as a sniffer dog. Bombs going off every day, people shooting at you, rockets whizzing past your head. I've just recently come back after 6 months and I'm just going to lay here in my basket and have some time to myself.\"\n\n\"Well that's only fair. Good on you, enjoy yourself\" \n\nSo the man goes over to the owner, \"How much for your dog then?\"\n\n\"\u00a35.\"\n\n\"\u00a35? That's bloody cheap for a talking dog!\"\n\n\"That's dog's a lying bastard, he's never even left Cornwall!\"\n\n\n\n",

In the first play, Rhino makes a play down the middle and gets taken down after only moving 5 yards. In the second play, Lion tries to make a pass but goes down before he can throw the ball. Then the big animal team tries to run Giraffe down the right side in a third attempt to gain some ground, but he gets pushed back behind the line of scrimmage and gets taken down. \nThe small animal coach, stunned, calls his players over to congratulate them. \"You guys have really pulled it together! Who made that tackle on Rhino?\"\nA small voice piped up, \"That was me!\" It was Centipede.\n\"Great job, Centipede! And who took down Lion right before he was going to make a pass?\"\n\"That was me too,\" Centipede said in his tiny voice.\n\"Did you make that block on Giraffe, too?\" Coach Lemur asked.\n\"Yes I did.\"\n\"Where were you for the first half of the game, Centipede??\"\n\"I was getting my ankles taped.\"",

He has been to 153 countries and seen what their is to see (Eiffel tower, Statue of Liberty, Taj Mahal, Great wall of China etc.) He has previously been to Australia before, but didn't see Uluru (he was only their for three days) \n\nSo, he decided to go from New York-Sydney-Alice Springs-Uluru. He went by QANTAS, you need to remember this, also the total flight time was around 30 hours. When he gets to Alice Springs, he gets a taxi, to his hotel (the fee was $45.03) and checks in. He gets to his room, (his room number is 145A) and unpacks all of his clothes and puts on a new pair of clothes. He has a rest and then decides to go and visit Uluru, the main reason he went there in the first place. \n\nHe goes there, takes some really good photos, and then comes back to his hotel. He then gets some dinner, because he is hungry. He goes to a restaurant called 'Sounds of Silence'. He orders a medium-rare steak, and some chips as a side. It takes about 20 minutes for the food to get to him (not bad imo) and eats his food. He then pays a sum of $14.50 and goes back to his hotel. \n\nHe decides to have a shower. After the shower he goes into bed and starts reading a book. After about 30 minutes he starts getting tired and decides to go to sleep. He goes to sleep. \n\nAfter about one hour of sleeping, he gets waken up by a eerie noise (kind of like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPZ7SIr96EY ) He nods of again but the is waken AGAIN by the same noise an hour later. This happens all through the night. \n\nIts now morning and it is pretty clear that he wants to know what that sound was coming from. He has breakfast, has a shower, gets dressed and packs up (he is going on a flight to Greenland on the same day) He goes to the lobby and checks out. \nHe the asked the receptionist this:\n*John: Last night, I was awoken every hour by an eerie sound, do you know where the sound was coming from?\n*Receptionist: Im sorry, I cannot tell you, you have to be a priest.\n*John: Oh, ok. Thanks anyway\n\nSo John left, still wondering what that sound was. It is right now that I should tell you that John was a very eager man, and wanted to know everything. So, he decided to become a priest. After another month or two, he decides to go to the Vatican city, to become a priest. \n\nAfter two years of vigorous training to become a priest, he is given his priest licence by the Pope.\n\nSo, John gets on the first flight to Uluru, exited about finally finding out what made that sound. \n\nHe gets to the Alice Springs airport and goes to the hotel where he was previously staying at. He goes up to the receptionist, and shows him his priest licence. \n\nThe receptionist then gives him a key to a room on the third hallway, saying that what was inside that room was making the noise. \n\nHe gets into the elevator and goes to the third floor. He gets to the room.\n\nThis is what was inside the room: http://imgur.com/gS4KtRz",

As a result, they missed the final.\n\nThe Professor thought it over and then agreed they could \nmake up the final the following day. The guys were \nelated and relieved.\n\nThey studied that night and went in the next day at the \ntime the professor had told them. He placed them in \nseparate rooms and handed each of them a test booklet,\nand told them to begin. \n\nThey looked at the first problem, worth 5 points. It was \nsomething simple about free radical formation. \"Cool,\"\nthey thought at the same time, each one in his \nseparate room. \"This is going to be easy.\"\n\nEach finished the problem and then turned the page.

Finally, a helicopter flew over and lowered a rope.  \n\n*\u201cGrab the rope; we\u2019ll rescue you!\u201d* said the medic in the helicopter, speaking into a megaphone.  \n\n*\u201cNo thank you!\u201d* screamed the man through the howling wind, *\u201dMy life is in God\u2019s hands!\u201d*  \n\nSo the water continued to rise and, eventually, the man was swept away and drowned.  \n\nUp in heaven, the man came before God.  \n\n*\u201cWhy did you forsake me, God?\u201d* the man implored. *\u201cMy life was in your hands!\u201d*  \n\n*\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d* God replied. *\u201cI sent you a police escort, a rowboat, a helicopter\u2026\u201d*",

He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, \"Will this winter be cold?\" \"As of now, it looks like this winter is going to be quite cold,\" the forecaster said. So the Chief went back to his tribe and told them to collect even more wood. A week later he called the National Weather Service again and asked for an update. \"Yes,\" the man at National Weather Service again replied, \"based on incoming data, this winter is looking to be colder than we expected.\" The Chief was surprised, but again went back to his tribe, told them that this might be a very cold winter, and asked them to collect every scrap of wood they could find. One week later, the Chief called the National Weather Service yet again, hoping for a new answer. \"Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?\" \"Positive,\" the man replied. \"It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever.\" \"Really?\" the shocked Chief exclaimed. \"How can you be so sure?\" \"First,\" the forecaster replied, \"The Indians are collecting firewood like crazy.\"",

Just tape it to the end of your stick and if someone gets to close just thrust is forward and yell STAB STAB STAB. I promise you it will work!\"\nAgain he argues that this is ridiculous. But they are being called to the plane, so he takes his little knife and leaves, feeling very certain that he will not return home. \nFinally a few days latter him and his platoon are sent to defend a ridge against the enemy. He stands with his fellow soldiers awaiting what he was sure is certain death. Finally he sees the enemy break the horizon and as they start to get with in what would be rifle range he shoulders his stick and takes aim. \n\"BANG!!! BANG!!! BANG!!! BANG!!!\" He yells over and over. To his surprise it was working everyone that he yelled at fell to the ground dead. It was a miracle, he continued \"firing\" his weapon, until finally they were with in range of his bayonet.\n\"STAB!!! STAB!!! STAB!!!\" He yells thrusting his stick forward with out mercy. Still men fell before him, he was astounded. Out of the corner of his eye he sees one man coming towards him and he turns and takes aim\n\"BANG!! BANG!! BANG!!!\" The man doesn't fall... He starts to get scared... maybe it was all in his head.. a fluke!\n\"STAB!! STAB!!! STAABBBB!!!!\" The approaching soldier still doesn't fall! \n\nThe last thing our young soldier hears as he is run over by the enemy soldier is...\n\"TANK!!! TANK!!! TANK!!! TAN....\" ",

If I wanted to I would bet you $50000 that your testicles were shaped like dice.\"\n\nThe bank manager laughed at the absurdity and said he'd happily take that bet.\n\nThe reply he got wasn't what he expected. \"Okay - So you'll take my bet then?\" she asked.\n\nThe bank manager thought about it. Went over it in his mind. Left the room for a minute to check out his testicles. They really couldn't be described as dice-shaped. \n\nHe came back in and said \"I'll take the bet then!\"\n\n\"Wonderful!\" exclaimed the old lady. \"Now to make sure this is all above board I'll need to get my lawyer in here to witness and make sure your testicles are dice-shaped.\n\nThe bank manager decided this was okay, and they arranged a meeting the next morning at 10am.\n\nThat night, the bank manager was sweating. How could he do this? \n\nHe was not a betting man. But it was so stupid! His testes weren't the shape of dice! He examined himself over and over to make sure this wasn't some sort of trick. Finally satisfied, he got a couple of hours sleep before work.\n\nThe designated time arrived the next morning, and the bank manager gladly escorted the old woman and her lawyer into his office. This would be the easiest $50000 he would ever make!\n\nAfter his office door was closed, the old lady proceeded to ask the manager to lower his trousers and his underwear.\n\nHe did so, and the old lady and lawyer looked on.\n\n\"See?\" asked the bank manager. \"Completely normal!\" with a smile. \n\n\"Well you could be right\" said the old lady, \"But I want to make sure. May I feel them?\"\n\nThe bank manager thought about this and didn't want any dispute over the shape of his testicles. \"Okay then\" he replied. \n\nThe old lady leaned forward and cupped the bank manager's testes in her hands rolling each testicle between her fingers.\n\nAt this point, her lawyer started to bang his head against the wall. \n\nConfused, the manager looked at the lady who was now sat back in her chair. His eyes sought an explanation.\n\nShe looked up at the manager and explained \"Oh yes - I bet my lawyer $100000 that at 10am this morning I'd have the bank manager's testicles in my hand.\"\n",

Maybe he's been feeling confined by our relationship; maybe he thinks I'm trying to push him into some kind of obligation that he doesn't want, or isn't sure of.\n\nAnd Fred is thinking: Gosh. Six months.\n\nAnd Martha is thinking: But, hey, I'm not so sure I want this kind of relationship either. Sometimes I wish I had a little more space, so I'd have time to think about whether I really want us to keep going the way we are, moving steadily towards, I mean, where are we going? Are we just going to keep seeing each other at this level of intimacy? Are we heading toward marriage? Toward children? Toward a lifetime together? Am I ready for that level of commitment? Do I really even know this person?\n\nAnd Fred is thinking: ...so that means it was...let's see...February when we started going out, which was right after I had the car at the dealer's, which means...lemme check the odometer...Whoa! I am way overdue for an oil change here.\n\nAnd Martha is thinking: He's upset. I can see it on his face. Maybe I'm reading this completely wrong. Maybe he wants more from our relationship, more intimacy, more commitment; maybe he has sensed - even before I sensed it - that I was feeling some reservations. Yes, I bet that's it. That's why he's so reluctant to say anything about his own feelings. He's afraid of being rejected.\n\nAnd Fred is thinking: And I'm gonna have them look at the transmission again. I don't care what those morons say, it's still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It's 87 degrees out, and this thing is shifting like a garbage truck, and I paid those incompetent thieves $600.\n\nAnd Martha is thinking: He's angry. And I don't blame him. I'd be angry, too. I feel so guilty, putting him through this, but I can't help the way I feel. I'm just not sure.\n\nAnd Fred is thinking: They'll probably say it's only a 90-day warranty...scumballs.\n\nAnd Martha is thinking: Maybe I'm just too idealistic, waiting for a knight to come riding up on his white horse, when I'm sitting right next to a perfectly good person, a person I enjoy being with, a person I truly do care about, a person who seems to truly care about me. A person who is in pain because of my self-centered, schoolgirl romantic fantasy.\n\nAnd Fred is thinking: Warranty? They want a warranty? I'll give them a warranty. I'll take their warranty and stick it right up their...\n\n\"Fred,\" Martha says aloud.\n\n\"What?\" says Fred, startled.\n\n\"Please don't torture yourself like this,\" she says, her eyes beginning to brim with tears. \"Maybe I should never have...oh dear, I feel so...\"(She breaks down, sobbing.)\n\n\"What?\" says Fred.\n\n\"I'm such a fool,\" Martha sobs. \"I mean, I know there's no knight. I really know that. It's silly. There's no knight, and there's no horse.\"\n\n\"There's no horse?\" says Fred.\n\n\"You think I'm a fool, don't you?\" Martha says.\n\n\"No!\" says Fred, glad to finally know the correct answer.\n\n\"It's just that...it's that I...I need some time,\" Martha says.\n\n(There is a 15-second pause while Fred, thinking as fast as he can, tries to come up with a safe response. Finally he comes up with one that he thinks might work.)\n\n\"Yes,\" he says. (Martha, deeply moved, touches his hand.)\n\n\"Oh, Fred, do you really feel that way?\" she says.\n\n\"What way?\" says Fred.\n\n\"That way about time,\" says Martha.\n\n\"Oh,\" says Fred. \"Yes.\" (Martha turns to face him and gazes deeply into his eyes, causing him to become very nervous about what she might say next, especially if it involves a horse. At last she speaks.)\n\n\"Thank you, Fred,\" she says.\n\n\"Thank you,\" says Fred.\n\nThen he takes her home, and she lies on her bed, a conflicted, tortured soul, and weeps until dawn, whereas when Fred gets back to his place, he opens a bag of Doritos, turns on the TV, and immediately becomes deeply involved in a rerun of a college basketball game between two South Dakota junior colleges that he has never heard of. A tiny voice in the far recesses of his mind tells him that something major was going on back there in the car, but he is pretty sure there is no way he would ever understand what, and so he figures it's better if he doesn't think about it.\n\nThe next day Martha will call her closest friend, or perhaps two of them, and they will talk about this situation for six straight hours. In painstaking detail, they will analyze everything she said and everything he said, going over it time and time again, exploring every word, expression, and gesture for nuances of meaning, considering every possible ramification.\n\nThey will continue to discuss this subject, off and on, for weeks, maybe months, never reaching any definite conclusions, but never getting bored with it either.\n\nMeanwhile, Fred, while playing racquetball one day with a mutual friend of his and Martha's, will pause just before serving, frown, and say: \"Norm, did Martha ever own a horse?\"\n\nAnd that's the difference between men and women.",

How can I help you? \n\n     (Customer) Hello, I received an email from Golfsmith stating that my Pro V1 order has been canceled and I should go to your exchange to reorder it.  I tried your web site, but it seems like it is not working. So I am calling the 800 number. \n\n     (Receptionist) Yes, I am sorry about the web site. It should be fixed by the end of 2014. But I can help you. \n\n     (Customer) Thanks, I ordered some Pro V1 balls. \n\n     (Receptionist) Sir, Pro V1's do not meet our minimum standards, I will be happy to provide you with a choice of Pinnacle, TopFlite , or Callaway Blue. \n\n     (Customer) But I have played Pro V1 for years. \n\n     (Receptionist) The government has determined that Pro V1s are no longer acceptable, so we have instructed Titleist to stop making them.  TopFlites are better, sir, I am sure you will love them. \n\n     (Customer) But I like the Pro V1.  Why are TopFlites better? \n\n     (Receptionist) That is all spelled out in the 2700 page \"Affordable Golf Ball Act\" passed by Congress. \n\n     (Customer) Well, how much are these TopFlites ? \n\n     (Receptionist) It depends sir, do you want our Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum package? \n\n     (Customer) What's the difference? \n\n     (Receptionist) 12, 24, 36 or 48 balls. \n\n     (Customer) The Silver package may be okay; how much is it? \n\n     (Receptionist) It depends, sir; what is your monthly income? \n\n     (Customer) What does that have to do with anything? \n\n     (Receptionist) I need that to determine your government Golf Ball subsidy; then I can determine how much your out-of-pocket cost will be.  But if your income is below the poverty level, you might qualify for a subsidy.  In that case, I can refer you to our BallAid department. \n\n     (Customer) BallAid ? \n\n     (Receptionist) Yes, golf balls are a right, everyone has a right to golf balls.  So, if you can't afford them, then the government will supply them free of charge. \n\n     (Customer) Who said they were a right? \n\n     (Receptionist) Congress passed it, the President signed it and the Supreme Court found it Constitutional. \n\n     (Customer) Whoa.....I don't remember seeing anything in the Constitution regarding golf balls as a right. \n\n     (Receptionist) There's no explicit mention of golf balls in the Constitution, but President Obama is a former constitutional scholar and he believes it would have been included if the Constitutional had not been dr afted by a bunch of slave-owning white men.  The Democrats in the Congress and the Supreme Court agree with the President that golf balls are now a right guaranteed by the Constitution. \n\n    (Customer) I don't believe this... \n\n    (Receptionist) It's the law of the land sir. Now, we anticipated most people would go for the Silver Package, so what is your monthly income sir? \n\n    (Customer) Forget it, I think I will forgo the balls this year. \n\n     (Receptionist) In that case, sir, I will still need your monthly income. \n\n     (Customer) Why? \n\n     (Receptionist) To determine what your 'non-participation' cost would be. \n\n     (Customer) WHAT? You can't charge me for NOT buying golf balls. \n\n     (Receptionist) It's the law of the land, sir, approved by the Supreme Court. It's $49.50 or 1% of your monthly income..... \n\n     (Customer)(interrupting) This is ridiculous, I'll pay the $49.50. \n\n     (Receptionist) Sir, it is the $49.50 or 1% of your monthly income, whichever is greater. \n\n     (Customer) ARE YOU KIDDING ME? What a rip-off!! \n\n     (Receptionist) Actually sir, it is a good deal. Next year it will be 2%. \n\n     (Customer) Look, I'm going to call my Congressman to find out what's going on here. This is ridiculous. I'm not going to pay it. \n\n     (Receptionist) Sorry to hear that sir, that's why I had the NSA track this call and obtain the make and model of the cell phone you are using. \n\n     (Customer) Why does the NSA need to know what kind of CELL PHONE I AM USING? \n\n     (Receptionist) So they get your GPS coordinates, sir \n\n     (Door Bell rings followed immediately by a loud knock on the door) \n\n     (Receptionist) That would be the IRS, sir.

Probably wont be funny to younger kids but some old farts like me might get a chuckle:\n\n\n**Adopt an Enron Executive**\n\nDear kind-hearted friends...Now that the holiday season has passed, please look into your heart to help those in need. Enron executives in  our very own country are living at or just below the seven-figure salary level. And, as if that weren't bad enough, they will be deprived of it as a result of the bankruptcy and current SEC investigation.\nBut now, you can help! For only $20,835 a month, about $694.50 a day (that's less than the cost of a large screen projection TV) you can help an Enron executive remain economically viable during his time of need. This contribution by no means solves the problem, but it's a start!\nAlmost $700 may not seem like a lot of money to you, but to an Enron exec it could mean the difference between a vacation spent sucking ass in DC, golfing in Florida or a Mediterranean cruise. For you, seven hundred dollars is nothing more than rent, a car note or mortgage payments. But to an Enron exec $700 will almost replace his per diem.\nYour commitment of less than $700 a day will enable an Enron exec to buy that home entertainment center, trade in the year-old Lexus for a new Ferrari, or enjoy a weekend in Rio.\n\n**HOW WILL I KNOW I'M HELPING?**\nEach month, you will receive a complete financial report on the exec you sponsor. Detailed information about his stocks, bonds, 401(k), real estate, and other investment holdings will be mailed to your home. You'll also get information on how he plans to invest his golden parachute. Imagine the joy as you watch your executive's portfolio double or triple! Plus, upon signing up for this program, you will receive a photo of the exec (unsigned-for a signed photo, please include an additional $50.00). Put the photo on your refrigerator to remind you of other peoples' suffering.\n\n**HOW WILL HE KNOW I'M HELPING?**\nYour Enron exec will be told that he has a SPECIAL FRIEND who just wants to help in a time of need. Although the exec won't know your name, he will be able to make collect calls to your home via a special operator just in case additional funds are needed for unexpected expenses.\n\n**YES, I WANT TO HELP!**\nI would like to sponsor an Enron executive. My preference is checked below:\n[ ] Mid-level Manager\n[ ] Director\n[ ] Vice President (Higher cost; please specify which department)\n[ ] President (Even higher cost; please specify which department)\n[ ] CEO(Contribution: Average Enron janitor monthly salary x 700)\n[ ] Entire Company\n[ ] I'll sponsor an Exec most in need. Please select one for me.\n\nPlease charge the account listed below ___________ per day and send me a picture of the Enron executive I have sponsored, along with my very own Enron \"Keep America Strong; Sponsor an Enron Exec: Ask Me How!\" t-shirt to wear proudly.\n\nYour Name: _____________________Telephone Number:____________________ \nAccount Number: _________________________ Exp.Date:__________________\n\n[ ] MasterCard [ ] Visa [ ] American Express [ ] Discover\n\nSignature: _______________________\n\nMail completed form to \"The Invisible Hand\" or call 1-900-2MUCH now to enroll by phone.\n\nNote: Sponsors are not permitted to contact the executive they have sponsored, either in person or by other means including, but not limited to, telephone calls, letters, e-mail, or third parties. Keep in mind that the executive you have sponsored will be much too busy enjoying his free time, thanks to your generous donations. Contributions are not tax-deductible.\n",

Neither man can resist the kitschy style that the lamp could bring to their foyer, so they haggle the shop keeper down to a reasonable price and take it home. \n\nAt home, Neil is polishing the lamp, trying to bring it back to its original luster and shine when blue genie pops out.\n\n\"I am the genie of the lamp! You have freed me from my prison and have earned 3 wishes. I will grant one each day, but you must keep your wishes a secret until they've all comes true the morning after the third wish. What is your first wish?\"\n\nNeil leans forward to whisper his first wish into the genie's ear. That night, he manages to keep the secret of the genie from Bob, but only just. Upon waking the next morning, Neil and Bob are as young and fit as they had been in their 20s with full heads of hair, just the right amount of muscle tone and bronze tans. Bob is speechless and rather annoyed that Neil won't reveal the secret to their new youthful looks. Neil assures Bob that all would be revealed in two days. \n\nWith Bob at work, Neil sneaks into the garage, rubs the lamp and whispers his second wish into the genie's ear. After another night of pestering from Bob, he and Neil manage to go to bed without the deal being broken. \n\nThe couple awake the next morning when the phone rings. Still looking youthful as ever, Bob answers the phone and nearly faints as he's told about a long-lost uncle having died heirless and leaving him his oil fortune worth no less than two billion dollars. The man is rich and will never have to work another day of his life. \n\nDodging even more questions, Neil manages to get Bob out the door and down to the bank to fill out forms and start investing his new wealth. While he's gone, Neil goes into the garage to make his final wish. \n\nThat night, neither man are able to sleep much, but somehow find themselves in bed when they awake to a knock on the front door. Bob gets up, figuring that it's another incredibly lucky or magical event about to be revealed. To his horror, a dozen KKK members in robes with torches, pitchforks and two lengths of rope are trying to force their way in. \n\nBob runs back to the bedroom and shakes Neil awake. Neil can't quite understand the terror in his partner's face.\n\n\"You bastard! What's going on? The youth, the wealth, the men outside- tell me NOW or I'm leaving you!\" \n\n\"Well,\" Neil explains, \"Now that all the wishes have come true, I can tell you that I found a genie in that old lamp that we bought over the weekend. I wished for us to have youth, wealth and, well, the third should be obvious.\"\n\n\"What's so obvious about a gang of Klansmen trying to lynch us?!\" Bob demands. \n\n\"Oh shit!\" Neil exclaims, \"This is definitely NOT what i meant when I asked for the two of us to be hung like black guys!\"",

The clerk said, 'Well, I\ndon't know that I have anything that will keep her occupied for so many\nweeks, except... the Magic Penis!'\n\nThe husband said, 'The what'?\n\nThe clerk repeated, 'The Magic Penis,' and pulled out what seemed to be an ordinary dildo.\n\nThe husband laughed, and said, 'It looks to me like a plain old dildo!'\n\nThe clerk pointed to the door and Said, 'Magic Penis, door!'\n\nThe penis arose from its box, darted over to the door and started pounding away at the keyhole.\nThe whole door shook wildly with vibrations. So much so, that a crack began to form down the middle.\n\nThen the clerk said, 'Magic Penis, return to your box!'\n\nThe penis stopped and returned to the box.\n\nThe husband was delighted, bought it and took it home to his wife.\n\nAfter the husband had been gone for a few days, the wife remembered the Magic Penis. She undressed, opened the box and said 'Magic Penis, my crotch.'\n\nThe penis shot like a rocket to her crotch. It was absolutely incredible.\n\nAfter three mind shattering orgasms, she became totally exhausted and decided she'd had enough. She tried to pull it out, but it was stuck. Her husband had neglected to tell her how to turn it off.\n\nSo she got dressed, went to her car and headed out for the nearest hospital.\n\nAlong the way, \"Magic\" kept the action going; she had another incredibly intense orgasm, making her swerve all over the road.\n\nA roadside patrol officer saw this and immediately pulled her over. He asked for her licence, and then questioned her as to how much she'd had to drink.\n\nStill gasping and twitching, the woman said, 'I haven't had anything to drink officer. You see, I've got this Magic Penis dildo stuck in my crotch and it won't stop screwing me.'\n\nThe officer looked at her for a second, shook his head and replied, 'Yeah right ... Magic Penis, my ass ! '\n\n... And the rest, as they say, is history.",

The grandpa looks over at the boy eating the cookies and says \"say boy, what do you say about me getting one of those cookies?\". the boy looks up at him with just a couple cookies left and asks \"well Grandpa, can your penis touch your butthole?\" the Grandpa chuckles to himself and says \"of course it can, boy. I'im a grown man!\".\n  \n\nThe boy smiling now, about to pop the last cookie in his mouth looks at his grandpa and says \"Good! Then you can go fuck yourself!\" \n\n\n\n",

I\u2019ve had hunners of pets, had dogs, had cats, had hamsters, had fish, I\u2019m looking for something different\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat about a turtle?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I\u2019ve had 15 turtles!  Something original!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about a lizard?\u201d\n\n\u201cNae a fecking Lizard!  I\u2019ve had heaps of lizards I\u2019ve got lizards coming out my fecking ears!  Something different, something exciting!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about a monkey, they\u2019re pretty original and exciting.\u201d\n\n\u201cOriginal?!  I\u2019ve had mair monkeys then I\u2019ve had shags!  Unless you can offer me something that no one else has got, then I\u2019m walking out this shop!\u201d\n\n \n\nThe shopkeeper thought to himself silently, and then said;\n\n\u201cThere is one thing I can offer you.\u201d\n\nThe man was interested.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m interested\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFirst off you have to promise not to tell anyone you got it here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye nae bother!  Let\u2019s see it!\u201d\n\n \n\nSo the shopkeeper took the man to the back of the store.  There was a door covered with locks and chains.  Slowly the shopkeeper took off each chain and unlocked each lock.  He then opened the door and revealed a small room.  In a dimly lit corner of the room there was a majestic polar bear, tied up with a chain around it\u2019s neck, breathing heavily as it slept.\n\n \n\n\u201cBrilliant!\u201d  Exclaimed the man.  \u201cI don\u2019t care fit the price is, I\u2019m having that polar bear!\u201d\n\n \n\nThe man and the shopkeeper did the deal, the man took the polar bear by the rope and started to leave the shop.  Then the shopkeeper shouted at him\n\n\u201cWait!  I almost forgot.  There is one thing you must remember.  Never, ever touch the polar bear on the nose.  God help you if you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cNae problem!\u201d  Said the man as he toddled off.  Don\u2019t touch him on the nose, easy peasy.\n\n \n\nSo the man walked casually down the street with the polar bear, naebody gave them a second look, people are used to seeing this type of stuff.  They waited at the bus stop, when the bus came he argued with the driver that the polar bear should get on for free.  Begrudgingly paid for himself and the polar bear, took their seats on the bus, and eventually, got home.  The man tied the polar bear up in his kitchen, and stared at the beast in awe.\n\n \n\n\u201cBrilliant, me and this polar bear are gonna have so much fun.  We\u2019ll go for walks, we\u2019ll play fetch, we\u2019ll have bathtime.  It\u2019ll be great\u201d.\n\n \n\nThe man went to his bed that night dreaming of polar bears.  When he got up in the morning, he ran downstairs to see if the polar bear was up.  He ran into the kitchen but was disappointed to see the polar bear was still fast asleep.  He went back often that day, but the polar bear never awoke.   \n\n \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll just give him time, maybe he\u2019s tired and needs a rest.\u201d\n\n \n\nThe next morning the man awoke and ran to the kitchen.  But the bear was still asleep.  The next morning, the same thing.  The next morning, bear still snoring.  Morning after that, bears sitting there reading the morning paper.  Next morning, bears asleep.\n\n \n\n\u201cThis is useless.  What\u2019s the point in having a polar bear if it doesn\u2019t do anything!\u201d  The man exclaimed.\n\n \n\n\u201cI wonder what the shopkeeper meant would happen if I touched it\u2019s nose ...\u201d The man pondered.  It couldn\u2019t be anything that bad.  \n\n \n\nSlowly, the man approached the bear.  The bear was snoring heavily, it\u2019s sharp teeth dripping drool from the side of it\u2019s mouth.  The man wiped sweat from his brow as he stood face to face with the beast.  Slowly, he reached out his hand, and tapped the bear on the nose.  \n\n \n\nNothing.  No reaction from the bear whatsoever.\n\n \n\n\u201cFit the fu-\u201c\n\n\nSuddenly the bears eyes opened wide.  It appeared startled at first, but then saw the man.  The bear started to growl, and stood tall, pounding it\u2019s paws of the ground.\n\n \n\n\u201cAwww, shite!\u201d  said the man as he started to walk towards the door.  All of a sudden the chain ripped from the bears neck.  He was free to charge at the man.  The man turned and ran out of the house, and locked the door behind him.  He was sweating with fear, he could hear the polar bear banging on the other side of the door.  The man considered his options.  He saw his car and decided to jump in and just start driving, he would worry about where he was going later.*\n\n \n\n*If at this point in the story you\u2019re wondering why, if the man had a car, he took the bus to the pet shop, it\u2019s because parking prices for the city centre are absolutely extortionate. \n\n \n\nThe man turned the ignition on, slammed his foot on the pedal, and the car slammed into his house and destroyed his bathroom.\n\n \n\n\u201cShite!\u201d  The man yelled as brown shitey water sprayed from what used to be his toilet all over his car.  \u201cLeft it in fucking reverse!\u201d\n\n \n\nThe man changed gears and drove away.  As he drove he caught a glimpse of the polar bear drinking the brown shitey water from what used to be the toilet.  The man puked a little.\n\n \n\nHe kept driving, considering where he should go.  \u201cThe airport!  I\u2019ll get away, stay abroad for a few days, wait for the polar bear to wander off, then it will all be fine.\u201d\n\n \n\nThe man began to relax, he had it all worked out in his head.  He looked out his rear-view mirror, and his jaw dropped.  He saw running on the road, the polar bear, drool coming from it\u2019s mouth.  The man sped up but the polar bear kept running, it got faster and faster, closer and closer.  The polar bear was in touching distance of the car.  The man suddenly slammed on the breaks, as the car ground to a halt the polar bear ran head first into the bumper and fell back.  The man laughed as he drove away to the airport, leaving the polar bear on the side of the road.\n\n \n\nThe man got to the airport, ran inside, and looked for the first plane out of the country.  There was a flight departing in 20 minutes for Cuba.  The man went to the counter, pulled out his credit card, and bought a one way ticket.  He went through security, into customs, bought a kit kat, a bottle of Coke, and a Take A Break, and boarded the flight.  \n\n \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all going to be okay.\u201d  The man thought, as he sat at his window seat on the plane.  The plane began to take off, and the man decided it would be nice to have a view of the ground.  He lifted the window blind (you know the shitey wee plastic things you get on a plane) and was terrified to see, on the wing of the plane, the polar bear, with his face pressed up against the window staring at the man.  The man yelped, and pulled the blind back down. \n\n \n\n\u201cHow the fuck \u2026\u201d The man thought to himself.  The plane was shaking with the force of taking off.  \u201cit\u2019ll be fine, there is no way he will survive the whole plane journey out there.\u201d\n\n \n\nThe plane evened out, and the man slowly opened the blind again, the polar bear was still there, face pressed up against the window.  The man pulled the blind back down again.  \u201cHo-lee-crap.\u201d  The man thought, as he slumped in his seat.  There was nothing that he could do but wait it out.  He kept checking every 10 minutes or so, but every time the bear was still there at the window, face pressed up against the glass, staring at the man.  The man drifted off, and awoke several hours later.  He opened the blind but the bear was still there, staring.\n\n \n\n\u201cJesus!  That bear is determined!\u201d  The man mumbled.  He felt his stomach rumble.  He looked about for his kit kat but couldn\u2019t see it anywhere.  He peered out the window.  The polar bear was grinning, as it unwrapped the mans kit kat and slowly ate it, savouring every chocolaty bite.\n\n \n\n\u201cSon of a bitch\u201d The man cursed, under his breath.  He pulled the blind back down and sighed.  He could feel the plane coming in to land.  What was he going to do?  He decided he would just have to get off the plane as fast as possible and run.  As the plane grounded to a stop the man jumped over people, squeezed his way through.  He barged past a young couple, then yelled \u201cPISS OFF!\u201d at an old lady at the front as he knocked her to the ground.  He jumped from the plane and started running.  He heard the thud of the polar bear as it jumped from the wing and started chasing him.  \n\n \n\nThis was it, the man thought.  He couldn\u2019t get away from the bear.  He couldn\u2019t outrun it.  He didn\u2019t even know where he was going.  He soon found himself at a dead end.  He turned and gulped.  The polar bear stood there, towering over the man.  It had the look of a hunter in it\u2019s eyes, and drool in it\u2019s mouth.\n\n \n\n\u201cWhy the fuck did I have to tap it on the nose!  The man thought, as the polar bear slowly approached him, growling under it\u2019s breath.  The man felt warm liquid trickle down his leg as he cowered in the corner.  The bear stood over the man, sniffed at him.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe man started to cry.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe polar bear roared.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe man felt excrement build in his pants.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn one swift movement, the polar bear lifted it\u2019s paw high above the man\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIt brought it\u2019s paw swinging down\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe paw connected with the mans shoulder, as the polar bear yelled\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u201cTIG!

The grave site was piled high with flours.\n\nAunt Jemima delivered the eulogy and lovingly described Doughboy as a man who never knew how much he was kneaded. Born and bread in Minnesota, Doughboy rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes. Despite being a little flaky at times, he lived to be a crusty old man and was considered a positive roll model for millions.\n\nDoughboy is survived by his wife Play Dough, three children: John Dough, Jane Dough and Dosey Dough, plus they had one in the oven.

The deeply religious couple produced six children: Holie Schitt, Giva Schitt, Fulla Schitt, Bull Schitt, and the twins Deap Schitt and Dip Schitt.\n\nAgainst her parents' objections, Deap Schitt married her cousin Dumb Schitt, a high school dropout. After being married 15 years, Jack and Noe Schitt divorced.\n\nNoe Schitt later married Ted Sherlock, and, because her kids were living with them, she wanted to keep her previous name. She was then known as Noe Schitt Sherlock.\n\nMeanwhile, Dip Schitt married Loda Schitt, and they produced a son with a rather nervous disposition named Chick N. Schitt.\n\nTwo of the other six children, Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt, were inseparable throughout childhood and subsequently married the Happens brothers in a dual ceremony.\n\nThe wedding announcement in the newspaper announced the Schitt-Happens nuptials.\n\nThe Schitt-Happens children were Dawg, Byrd, and Hoarse.

There is no answer, and they stagger inside. It is dark and cold inside, but the three drunks amble on.\n\nThey come upon a large hall full o' tasty treats that no drunk could pass on. Boxty, Sodabread, Chicken and Leek pie, a big pile o' potatoes, it was all there. They gorged themselves until they could nary lift a finger, when suddenly a dour figure emerged from the shadows.\n\n\"I take it you've enjoyed the feast Lord O'Malley has set for ye\" the shadowy skeleton of a man cackled.\n\nLike rats in the light, the three scurried ungracefully from their seats in all directions. \"You, young man, come with me.\" The dour man (the butler? the caretaker?) grabbed the young intoxicated Danny from the cold stone floor.\n\n\"M'Lord will be waiting for ye. He's not accustomed to strangers in the night.\"\n\nUp a winding path of stairs they went, up into a tower. They entered a room, and though dimly lit, it burnt poor Danny's eyes.\n\nIn a grand chair by an even grander fireplace, an old and tired but rosy-cheeked fellow stared seemingly past Danny. \"So this be what's causin' the ruckus. Ye know, yar not the farst te make ye way inte' the castle. I suppose ye fancy stayin' a spell?\" Before Danny could answer, the thin minion again grabbed his shoulders and whisked him away, this time down, down, down, farther into the earth than Danny figured he'd ever been.\n\nInto some sort of dungeon they emerged, where among dozens of emaciated and hollow souls there hung in shackles the familiar face of Grady. The two said nothing to one another, and managed a few winks of troubled unconsciousness before the dawn brought a great commotion of sirens, shouting voices and the occasional *BANG!* Bye and bye, they were released from their prison and carted on home. Grady spoke little to Danny, and said nothing of their mutual friend, whom Danny had not seen nor heard from since their encounter in the dining hall.\n\nSeveral weeks later, Danny received a letter of invitation to a memorial service for all who had perished in the unlawful custody of Lord O'Malley. All the Irish treasures O'Malley had hoarded were on display: Coats of arms, suits of armor, statues, furniture, tapestries, rugs, harps, bagpipes were all on display.\n\nIt was revealed that O'Malley had been keeping his prisoners for purposes of human trafficking, torture, cannibalism, and even stranger terrible things.\n\nAt the end of the service, there was a beautiful recitation of traditional Irish music by a prestigious ensemble, using the bagpipes and harps seized from the estate.\n\n\"So beautiful this song,\" mused Danny. \"If only dear Colin were with us to hear it.\"\n\n\"But he is,\" lamented Grady. He stared coldly into Danny's Eyes.\n\n\"Oh Danny, boy... the pipes... the pipes are Colin.\"",

I didn't mean to look, but you couldn't not notice the gentleman's extremely large penis. I did my thing and as we were washing our hands I jokingly asked him if he was a real leprechaun. \n\n\"FUCK,\" he says. \"FUCK. You guessed it. And when I'm in a hurry, always when I'm in a fuckin hurry. Spit it out, what do you want, I don't got all fuckin day.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, what do I want?\" I asked. \n\n\"You recognized me as a laprechaun and now you get ONE fucking wish, but hurry up now because I'm late you little cunt!\"\n\nThinking this was a joke, I didn't wait long to say \"I want a dick as big as yours bro, that thing's enormous.\"\n\nThe leprechaun gets all serious. He informs me that he is indeed a real leprechaun and he can make this happen for me but warns me that I might want another wish. \"Now laddy, that is a huge responsibility. Larger than you know. You could ask me for a million dollars or anything else you want,\" as he takes a HUGE wad of cash out of his tiny pocket to my amazement. \n\n\"I'd really like a dick as big as yours\" I say without hesitation. My wife would love that thing.\n\n\"A dick this big can really hurt someone laddy. I'll grant you your wish, but first you have to let me fuck you in the ass so you can feel how bad this could hurt someone before you hurt someone yourself. Or do you just want this million dollars?\" as he waves the stack of cash in my face.\n\nI thought for a second, but undaunted, agreed to his terms. As a hetero I've never taken anything to the ass but I figure \"What the hell? No one will know... it'll be between me and the leprechaun, and my wife would really like this...\" He took me into the stall and had his way with me. Let's just say he was larger than he looked, and it hurt very, very bad...\n\nHe finishes up, wipes off, and starts to head out of the bathroom. I look down at my pathetic member and it hasn't changed in size at all. In fairly severe pain from my violation, I called out weakly \"Hey leprechaun! You forgot to grant my wish!\"\n\nHe turns around, comes back, and asks \"Laddy, how old are you?\"\n\n\"32\" I murmer out through my pain.\n\nHe puts his hand consolingly on my shoulder and asks, \"And you still believe in leprechauns do you?\"\n\n**tl;dr** how long does it take for a leprechaun wish to become granted?",

After trekking for days through dense snake-infested jungle, they find a tribe that is rumoured to have some very strange,\u2026and very bizarre customs.  As the missionaries enter the village, they are immediately, captured and tied up. \n\nAlmost immediately once they are captured and tied up\u2026it begins: The beating of drums and chanting. This goes on all day and all night\u2026 all they can hear is chanting and the constant beating of drums. The chanting and drumming get louder and louder until some of the tribesmen grab one of the missionaries and bring him to the Chief of the tribe.\n\n\"Death or Koom-Balla\", the chief says to the first missionary holding up a large knife and a freshly plucked feather from the rare pikki-wikki bird.\n\nNot knowing what Koom-Balla was, but not wanting to die, he looks at the feather and says, \"Koom-Balla?\".\n\nImmediately, he is grabbed by 20 or 30 of the tribesmen and every member of the tribe produces a freshly plucked feather from the rare pikki-wikki bird, and proceeds to tickle the missionary. At first, it seems like a good laugh for the missionary, but it goes on and on\u2026.you know the kind where you\u2019re laughing so hard and you can\u2019t stop. At first it\u2019s like that. Then his sides start to hurt.  This goes on for 2 days ,,,then his organs start to fail from all the laughing\u2026 until he is carried,  unconscious, off into the jungle\u2026 never to be seen again.\n\nThe village goes quiet for a few days, and then it begins again. The 2 other missionaries hear the chanting and drumming start to build up again. Louder and louder it becomes\u2026increasing in intensity all day and all night when suddenly the tribesmen grab the second missionary and take him to the Chief.\n\n\"Death or Koom-Balla\", the chief says to the second missionary.\n\nHaving seen what Koom-Balla was, but still not wanting to die, the second missionary reluctantly says, \"Koom-Balla\".\n\nImmediately, he is grabbed by 20 or 30 of the tribesmen, and, again every one of them produces a freshly plucked feather from the rare pikki-wikki bird, and proceeds to tickle the missionary. Anyway, so just like with the first missionary, it seems kind of fun for the first little while\u2026getting tickled, but when you have that many feathers tickling you, you get to that stage where you\u2019re laughing so hard, you don\u2019t know how to stop. And again, just like the first missionary, his sides start to hurt from all the laughing, then his organs start to fail. Again, it goes on for 2 days until he is carried, unconscious, off into the jungle\u2026 NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN!!. \n\nThe third missionary waits\u2026in fear.\nAn uneasy quiet falls over the village.\n\nBut then, a day later, the remaining missionary hears the chanting and drumming start to build up again. Immediately a sense of extreme panic and anxiety comes over him. The chanting and drumming build up louder and louder\u2026seemingly more intense with every passing hour\u2026even louder than with the first two missionaries\u2026 when the tribesmen grab him and take him to the Chief.\n\n\"Death or Koom-Balla\", the chief says to the third missionary.\n\nBy now, the missionary has seen what has been done to the first 2 missionaries and has decided he does not want to go through that.\n\nAgain, the Chief says, \"Death or Koom-Balla\".\n\nReluctantly, the missionary hangs his head, says a silent prayer, and resigned to his fate, \u2026says, \"Death\". \n\n\"Death\", screams the Chief. \"Death\u2026DEATH\u2026.BY Koom-Balla!!!!\"\n",

It was a nice place, and the doctor enjoyed keeping up with the property.\n\nLast year, the inn tragically burned down; the doctor and his wife subsequently filed for insurance. The insurance inspectors arrived, looked with the police, and found evidence that it was arson, based on the burn pattern in the timbers. The doctor thought it was probably electrical since the inn had aluminum wiring.\n\nThe case had to be brought to court, and it was the talk of the town. Everyone knew the doctor well, so the court had to import a jury from out of town. The case lasted for weeks, and the prosecution just couldn't quite pin the crime on anyone. \n\nAfter four long weeks in court, the wife suddenly broke down in the middle of her testimony. She told everyone it was insurance fraud because the inn was falling apart and the doctor wanted money. The whole town was in shock; everyone trusted him simply for being a doctor. That's when it hit me.\n\nNobody suspects the Spanish Inn physician. \n\n",

However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. \n\nFinally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.' \n\nThe father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.' \n\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball. \n\nThe boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again. \n\nThe next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. \n\n`Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, `If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' \n\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls. \n\nThe boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. \n\nThe next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. \n\n`Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' \n\n`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. \n\n`I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' \n\nAnd so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. \n\nThe boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. \n\n`Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' \n\nThe son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humour me, dear father.' \n\nThe carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. \n\nThe next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. \n\n`Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' \n\nOne of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. \n\nThe next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. \n\nThe following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. \n\nThe following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. \n\n`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' \n\nIt was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. \n\nThe next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. \n\n`Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' \n\nThat night, the son spent on board the tanker. \n\nThe next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. \n\nA few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. \n\nHis father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' \n\nWeakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' \n\n`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. \n\n`Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe son nodded weakly. \n\nThe next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. \n\n`Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,' the father requested. \n\nThe son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. \n\n`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. \n\n`I- I-' \n\nThen he died. \n",

We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon.\" She hears the little boy continue, \"For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat. Remember, there is no smoking on the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us today.\" \nAs the mother began to smile, the child added, \"For those of you who are pissed off about the TWO HOUR delay, please see the b*tch in the kitchen.\"",

The parrot had a bad attitude and  an even worse vocabulary.\n\nEvery word out of the bird's mouth was rude,  obnoxious and laced with profanity. Alan tried and tried to change the  bird's attitude by consistently saying only polite words, playing soft  music and anything else he could think of to 'clean up' the bird's  vocabulary.\n\nFinally, Alan was fed up and he yelled at the  parrot. The parrot yelled back. Alan shook the parrot and the parrot got  angrier and\neven more rude. Alan, in desperation, threw up his hand,  grabbed the bird and put him in the freezer. For a few minutes the parrot  squawked and kicked and screamed.\n\nThen suddenly there was total  quiet. Not a peep was heard for over a minute.\n\nFearing that he'd hurt  the parrot, Alan quickly opened the door to the freezer. The parrot calmly  stepped out onto Alan's outstretched arms and said \"I believe I may have  offended you with my rude language and actions. I'm sincerely remorseful  for my inappropriate transgressions and I fully intend to do everything I  can to correct my rude and unforgivable behaviour.\"\n\nAlan was stunned at  the change in the bird's attitude.\n\nAs he was about to ask the parrot  what had made such a\ndramatic change in his behaviour, the bird spoke-up,  very\nsoftly, \"May I ask what the turkey  did?\"",

The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking directions to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two judges (couple of local Indians) that the curry wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted. Here are the scorecards from the event.\"\n\nCurry # 1: Manoj's Maniac Mobster Monster Curry Judge One: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.\n\nJudge Two: Nice, smooth tomato flavour. Very mild.\n\nFrank: Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These char o's are crazy.\n\nCurry # 2: Applesamy's Afterburner Curry Judge One: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.\n\nJudge Two: Exciting BBQ flavour, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.\n\nFrank: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich manoeuvre. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.\n\nCurry # 3: Farouk's Famous Burn Down the Barn curry Judge One: Excellent firehouse curry! Great kick. Needs more beans.\n\nJudge Two: A beanless curry, a bit salty, good use of red peppers.\n\nFrank: Call Colesburg, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now, get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all the beer.\n\nCurry # 4: Barbu's Black Magic Judge One: Black bean curry with almost no spice. Disappointing.\n\nJudge Two: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a curry.\n\nFrank: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it, is it possible to burn-out taste buds? Savathree, the bar maid, was standing behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb. bitch is starting to look HOT, just like this nuclear waste I'm eating. Is curry an aphrodisiac?\n\nCurry # 5: Laveshnee's Legal Lip Remover Judge One: Meaty, strong curry. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.\n\nJudge Two: Curry using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.\n\nFrank: My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her curry had given me brain damage. Savathree saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off? It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those char o's!\n\nCurry # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety Judge One: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety curry. Good balance of spice and peppers.\n\nJudge Two: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb.\n\nFrank: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I shit myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Savathree, she must be kinkier than I thought. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone!\n\nCurry # 7: Sugash's Screaming Sensation Curry Judge One: A mediocre curry with too much reliance on canned peppers.\n\nJudge Two: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of curry peppers at the last moment. I should note that I am worried about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.\n\nFrank: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with curry which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit to match my damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. Screw it, I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4 inch hole in my stomach.\n\nCurry # 8: Hansraj's Mount Saint Curry Judge One: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend curry, safe for all, not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.\n\nJudge Two: This final entry is a good, balanced curry, neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge Number 3 passed out, fell over and pulled the curry pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Yank, wonder how he'd have reacted to a really hot curry?\n\nFrank: (editor's note: Judge #3 was unable to report)\n",

She bent over to pick it up infront of me. I'm sorry priest, but lust took over me. I had to have her right there and then.\"\n\"It's a shame that you couldn't complete your task to join this church.

One of these farms was attended by a Chinese immigrant, the second was tended by a Japanese immigrant. On one fine day, the Korean decided to go and see how the farm work was going along at the Chinese man's farm. When the got there, the Chinese man looks up and says, \"Man, I work twice as hard as you but only make half as much!\" The Korean says with a wink, \"That's cuz I got what's called smarts.\" The Chinese farmer says, \"What's smarts?\" The Korean man says, \"C'mere I'll show ya.\" He puts his hand in front of a nearby tree and says, \"Here, hit my hand.\" The Chinese farmer looks doubtful, not wanting to lose his job and says, \"Are you sure?\" \"Yeah, yeah, do it already.\" The Chinese man winds up and goes to slug the Korean's hand just as he pulls it out of the way. As the Chinese man jumps up and down in pain, the Korean explains, \"See, that's smarts.\" And with a wink, he gets up on his horse and rides away. A couple days later, the Chinese man goes to visit the Japanese man's farm. They shoot shit for a little and soon the Japanese man says, \"You know, I work twice as hard as you and I only make half! Why is that?\" And the Chinese man grins slyly and says, \"It's cuz I gots smarts!\" \"Huh? Whats smarts?\" The Chinese man enthusiastically says, \"Here, I'll show yah!\" He looks around the Japanese man's field and sees no trees. Looks like he'll have to improvise. He places his hand in front of his face, \"Here, slug my hand!\" ",

She insisted that she must\nspeak with the president of the bank to open a savings account\nbecause, \"It's a lot of money!\" The receptionist objected, stating, \"You can't just walk in here\nand expect to see the president of the Bank of America.  He's a\nvery busy man.\" \"But I am here to make a very large cash deposit,\" added the old\nwoman. The receptionist momentarily looked at the sack of money, then\nwalked back to one of the rear offices. She came back and said,\n\"You're in luck this morning, he will see you,\" and ushered her in to see the president of the Bank of America. When she walked in to a large office with a nicely tailored man\nbehind a great oaken desk.  The bank president stood up and\nasked,  \"How can I help you?\" She replied, \"I would like to open a savings account,\" and placed the bag of money on his desk. \"How much would you like to deposit?\" he asked curiously.\n \"$180,000, if you please,\" and dumped the cash out of her bag\nonto his desk.\n The President was suprised to see all this cash, so he asked her,\n\"Ma'am, I'm surprised you're carrying so much cash around,\nespecially a woman at your stage in life. Where did you come by\nthis kind of money?\"  \n The old lady coyly replied, \"I make bets.\"\n Surprised, the president then asked, \"Bets?  What kind of bets?\" \n The old woman said, \"Well, for example, I'll bet you $25,000 that\nyour balls are square.\"\n \"What?!\" cried the man, \"you want to bet me $25,000 that my balls,\nmy testicles, are square?\" He could hardly hold back from laughing.\n \"Yes, you heard me.  In fact, by ten o'clock tomorrow morning,\nI'll bet you $25,000 that your balls will be square.\"\n The man smiled broadly, thinking he had a live one.  \"You've got\nyourself a bet!\" and shook her hand. The little old lady then said, \"Okay, but since there is a lot of money involved, may I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. as a witness?\" \"Sure!\" replied the confident president.That night, the president got very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of a mirror checking his balls, turning from side to side, again and again.  He thoroughly checked them out until he was sure that there was absolutely no way his balls were\nsquare and that he would win the bet. The next morning, at precisely 10:00 a.m., the little old lady appeared with her lawyer at the president's office.  She introduced\nthe lawyer to the president and repeated the bet: \"$25,000 says\nthe president's balls are square!\" The president agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his pants so they could all see.  The president complied.\nThe little old lady peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel them. \"Well, Okay,\" said the president, obviously embarrassed. Thinking to himself, \"$25,000 is a lot of money, I guess it's okay.\" He then said, \"Yes, $25,000 is a lot of money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure.\" As the old woman started to feel the banker's testicles, he noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the wall.The president asked the old lady, \"What the hell's the matter with your lawyer?\"\nThe old lady replied, \"Nothing, except I bet him $100,000 that\nat 10:00 a.m. today, I'd have the balls of the president of the Bank of America in my hands.\"",

The rule was told to the gatekeeper so he could follow it from here on.  \n  \nThe first person who died had stepped up to the gate. The gatekeeper then proceeded to say, \"Well sir, before I could let you in, I need to ask. How was your day today?\" The man said, \"Well to tell you the truth, it was absolutely terrible! I had suspicions that my wife was cheating on me for some time now, so I decided to come home from work early to see if I could catch her in the act. I got up to my 6th story apartment building, unlocked the door and thrust it open as fast as I can, to see my wife laying in bed half naked with a whole bunch of clothes on the floor. This makes me furious, as I go rampaging across the apartment trying to look for the bastard. I looked basically everywhere, until I see him hanging from the balcony of the story above us. I go out there and start socking him in the chest and stomach as hard as I could, trying to push him off, until he finally loses his grip and falls 6 stories down. I thought that would be the end of it, but I saw that he managed to break his fall on the way down by landing in a tree. So I went inside, grabbed the fridge, and hauled it out the balcony, where it fell right on top of em, killing the fucker! I was so exited and mad and pumped, that I had a heart attack from it, and now I'm here\".The gatekeeper, fascinated by the story said, \"Wow, you really did have a bad day didn't you? Go on through sir. The man obliged, and went on his way through the pearly gates.  \n\nThe second man finally approached the gate, and the gatekeeper was eager to hear his story. He asked him how his day was to which he responded, \"Well at first it wasn't too bad. I was starting out the day by getting an intense workout done on my 7th story balcony. But then I kinda got a little carried away a bit and found myself hanging from the outside of my balcony. To make matters worse, I see this crazy pissed off guy on the story below me thrust the door open, and started jabbing at my torso. I couldn't hold on any longer, and fell down about 6 stories to where a tree broke my fall. The last thing I remember was laying on my back in massive pain when I see a little dot start to get bigger. As soon as I could tell that it was a fridge, everything went black and I ended up here. The Angel told him, \"That truly is a terrible way to go! Make your way through sir, i'll open the gates for you.\" The man proceeds through while the gatekeeper says to himself \"I could get used to this. Hehe.\" \n\n The the third guy goes up to the gates and the gatekeeper then says, \"Hello there sir, before I could let you in, I must ask, how was your day?\" The man then tells the gatekeeper, \"You're never gonna believe what happened to me. Picture this, I'm naked, in a fridge...\"",

He had single-handily turned around the fortunes of three failing schools in his city with his tight intelligent financial control, understanding of the school's inherent needs, and great relationships with all staff/pupils.\n\nRecently he had accepted a job at the largest, most run down, violent school in the area. It was full of underprivileged children who were taking their poor upbringings and cynical views on the world to school every morning. No staff wanted to be there, no pupil felt safe there. Bullying, drugs, it truly was a mess.\n\nHowever, over time, Mr Johnson began to work his patented magic. Within a year the school's fortunes were turning around. Bad behaviour was dropping, students were learning to believe in themselves, staff were actually enjoying teaching these students who were all becoming willing learners. Violence stopped, the drugs supply stopped, bullying stopped, students were actually happy.\n\nAs time passed, the school began to churn out successful alumni. Lots went on to college thanks to the ambitions installed in them by one understanding, knowledgeable headmaster. Students when asked about Mr Johnson would often describe him as a friend, but also an interesting teacher who they wanted to listen to every time he spoke. The schools facilities were upgraded to become state of the art thanks to Mr Johnson's financial control, and parents began fighting over getting their children accepted in to it when they were old enough to go rather then fighting to stop it!\n\nBut one day as Mr Johnson was strolling down the corridors exchanging pleasantries with students and staff he was accosted by a tearful young boy named little Timmy. Timmy Announced:\n\n\"Mister Johnson! My Dad is always angry at my Mum. He says she can never do anything right. He says she is a worthless wife and she could never satisfy him, he says he should cheated on her or leave her!\"\n\n\"Oh dear...\" replied Mr Johnson. \"I'm so sorry to hear that Timmy, but in domestic affairs like this I have no control. Unless your parents are violent or bad towards you, I can do nothing but offer you my emotional support\"\n\n\"Right...\" Timmy sniffed. And with that, he was gone.\n\nMr Johnson didn't hear from Timmy again, he noticed the boy was sad, but on close inspection he couldn't see any signs of abuse. What could he do unless the parents came to him?\n\nMr Johnson had an idea. A few weeks passed and it was parent's evening at the school, where parents come in to meet the teachers. Mr Johnson had organised it and it was going really well. He had arranged to meet Timmy's parents so he had an excuse to fix things. But to his dismay, things had escalated before he got the chance - As he passed through the main school hall were teachers, parents and their children were all happily conversing a loud scream echoed down the hall - it was Timmy's Dad.\n\nTimmy's Dad was causing an enormous scene, shouting at Timmm's Mum. \"*You are worthless! You can't do anything right! You can't satisfy me! I should CHEAT on you or LEAVE you*!!\"\n\nIt even looked like Timmy's Dad may be threatening to throw a punch. Timmy's mother was just standing cowering there in tears, as was poor little Timmy.\n\nMr Johnson rushed up to them and proclaimed \"YOU TWO! Come with me! Now!\"\n\nThe crowd which had formed watched the three walk off into a nearby walk-in cloakroom, leaving Timmy standing in the main hall. One parent went to comfort the boy.\n\nEverything fell silent, then a few minutes passed and some of the crowd began to dissipate. All of a sudden Mr Johnson and Timmy's parents emerged from the cloakroom. Timmy's Dad was wearing a wide, ear to ear smile like the cat that got the cream. His wife was tucked under his arm beaming with shy, cheeky, happiness at the floor.\n\n\"Come on Timmy, we're leaving!\" Announced his father triumphantly, and off they went.\n\nThe parent who had been looking after Timmy when they were gone picked up her jaw from the floor, turned to Mr Johnson in amazement and asked:\n\n\"Wait, he said she was worthless; she couldn't do anything right; she couldn't satisfy him; he should *cheat* on her or *LEAVE* her!! How on earth did you fix *that*?!\n\nMr Johnson coolly replied: \"I'm just a really great head-teacher\"\n",

He spent 8 hours a day in school, practicing most instruments he could find. He already mastered guitar, piano, bass, violin, oboe and flute fairly well. He spent 3 hours a day lsitening to classical music, analyzing it so he could learn to write it himself. At the tender age of 8 he had learned to read notes fluently.  \n\nOne day, he saw an ad in the local newspaper: \"Conducting classes! For beginners and experts!\" it said. The boy was thrilled. Finally, he had found a place where he could learn to conduct. So he went to the community center, to room 213, and was greeted by a rather small group spread out in a room with at least 40 chairs in rows. In the front of the room stood an elderly man, looking like he was passing through his eighties. He smiled a warm smile. The boy carefully made his way through the room. He sat down on a chair in the middle row, which was empty. He counted 13 other people in the room, including the elderly teacher. Most of them were older then he was, the oldest looking almost as old as teacher. \"Probably pursuing a choldhood dream\", the boy thought. \n\nSuddenly, the teacher spoke. \"Welcome!\" He said. \"My name is Tony Stryker, and I will be your teacher in the conducting classes.\" He smiled that warm smile again. \"Let's first of all try out your skills! I will be sitting by this piano\" he pointed at an old, battered piano in the corner, \"and pla, and you will all conduct me, one by one! No worries now, you're all here to learn!\" He once again cracked into that lovely smile. \"So, how about we start with you, young lady?\" \n\nThe lady he had nodded at rose. She was tall, slender, with a hard face. Probably around her thirties. She walked to the front of the room, and stood in front of the piano. The old teacher looked at her. \"Whenever you're ready.\" He said, and smiled. The woman raised her hands, and started moving her right hand in a motion which looked like an anchor: Down, left, right, up. Then she repeated it. She was steady, and looked straight at the man, who played along in her pace. After a while, he stopped. \"Good, good!\" He said. \"Have a seat. Now, how about... Ah, my fellow senior citizen in the back!\" He chuckled a little.\n\nThe old man rose, and slowly walked to the front of the room, his fedora a little crooked on his broad head. He stood in front of the piano, and raised his hands. They shook, and there was no way of telling if it was of nervousness, or some sort of disease. Maybe both. He then started doing the same motion as the woman had done, only not so steady in pace and a little slower. The teacher played along acordingly. He then said \"Great job, really! Thank you.\" The man did a little bow, then went back to his place. \n\nThe teacher looked over the classroom. His eyes landed on the young boy. \"How about you, lad?\" He said, and smiled. THe boy stumbled a little as he rose, nervous and excited. He made his way to the front of the room, in front of the piano, and started moving his hands. It felt good. He knew what he was doing. He had watched so many concerts, he had memorized every move. He started speeding up the tempo. Faster and faster. Suddenly, the teacher started to look worried, but the boy paid no mind. He was having so much fun. The tempo roose and rose, until suddenly... Silence.\n\nThe teacher was bent over the piano. Someone yelled \"Call 911!\", others rushed to his side. But it was to late. The old man had had a heart attack. THe paramedics said it was fatal, but necessereily caused by something in his environment. Despite that, the boy was devastated. He couldn't help but feel it was somehow his fault. His parents felt so bad for him, they decided to move from the town, to escape all the bad memories. And so, they fled to New York. \n\nThey got a small apartment, where they quickly settled in. The boy still was devastated, however. But yet, he still held on to his dream. He was to become a conductor. For years he practised, tried to perfect his pace and his discipline. Eventually, on his 20th birthday, his parents got him the greatest present of all: The chance to conduct the local high schools rendition of \"The Phantom of the Opera\". He was overjoyed. The very next day, he went to the school, to meet with the orchestra and the cast. \n\nHe talked to them, told them his dreams, and befriended them. Then, it was time for rehersal. Granted, the orchestra didn't play so well, and the cast was just high school students after all, but it was all he wanted. They practised hard, and our concuvtor was very pleased with the result. Soon, it was time for the very first show. All the students parents were also, as well as the staff, and some who just wanted to see a cheap musical. The cast was nervous, but seemed to manage it: The orchetra was worse. All the musicians in the orchestra were having minor panic-attacks, and a few were crying. Our conductor gathered them all backstage, and held a pep talk. After it, all the participants felt inspired, and was calm again. Our conductor was pleased, and so the show began.\n\nBut something must have happened, because the moment the first song started, the audience flinched. It sounded awful. It was off-beat, different keys, and the wrong songs. The cast messed up their lines, and the tuba player fainted. A few of the parent walked out at that very moment. Our conductor was devastated: He knew it was his fault. He was nothing more than a bad conductor. He ran out of the school, and took the first train, going anywhere. \n\nHe rode it to the end station before he realized where he was: Austin, Texas. He looked aroud, and wondered what he should do. He a little money, so he found a cheap hotel, and immedieatly started looking for a job. \n\nHe was amazed when the first thing he found in the newspaper read \"Assistant needed at Austin Concert Hall! Prior musical studies a must!\". He thought about it, and then stood up. It was his dream. So he marched down to the Austin Concert Hall, and did an interview with the director. A few days later, he recieved a phone call in his hotelroom: He was hired. \n\nHe worked there for a couple a months, cleaning, tuning instruments, taking care of some legal forms, when all of a sudden the conductor of the orchestra approched him. \" heard you wanted to become a conductor.\" He said. \"How would you like to try to conduct our orchestra, just for fun?\" Our conductor was stunned. He didn't know what to say. Of course he did, but who knew what could happen? He said to himself that nothing bad could happen, and told the chief conductor that he would love to try. But still, he walked with heavy steps towards the hall.\n\nInside, the whole orchestra was assembled on stage. Flutes, Violins, Cellos, Harps, Oboes and percussions, all in one place. It was beautifull. Put conductor stepped up to the stage, and onto the conductors podium... And gripped the Conductors baton. \"Okay, guys...\" He said, shakingly, \"Let's... Let's play Mozart's 5th.\" He starte moving the baton, and it was glorious. usic was all around him, and he lost himself in it. However, as he lost himself, he also lost grip of the baton. It flew out of his hand, and straight into the mouth of one of the violin players. \n\nShe died immediately. Our conductor was charged with manslaughter, and taken to prison. He was sentanced to death, by the electric chair. They gave him his last meal, a last prayer, and put him in the chair. They strapped him up, put water on his forehead, and put on the headpiece. And then, they pulled the switch.\n\nNothing happened. The staff checked all the wires, all circuits, and tried again. Still nothing. They called in an electrician, who looked at the chair, and stated that nothing was wrong, that it should work properly. Once again, they tried. Nothing. Not so much as a twitch. After a few hours, the director of the prison walked up to the sentanced man and asked \"Why won't you die? What is wrong you?!\". Our protagonist looked at the director, and said in a tired voice \"I suppose I'm just a poor conductor.\" ",

I worked as an accountant for years and years. Probably more than you could imagine. I was making a pretty poor living for myself, and I was very lonely. Being overworked for some years can really have an negative impact on a man, so I decided to take a vacation. I wanted to go some place with beaches, so I went to Hawaii. Typical, I know, but I had never been. The first day I'm there I take a walk on a big beach on the main island. As I'm walking along I stub my toe on something in the sand. I bend down to pick it up, and much to my surprise it's a genie lamp.\"\n\n\"A genie lamp?\" the other man says, \"Come on. You're kidding, right?\"\n\n\"I have an orange for a head and you're questioning THAT?\"\n\n\"I suppose you're right. Sorry, go ahead.\"\n\n\"Anyways, I rub the lamp and a genie pops out, obviously. Just like the stories, he said to me 'You can have three wishes!' My first wish, obviously, was to be rich beyond my wildest dreams. Then, right at that moment, I felt something really heavy in my pockets. Hundreds of dollars in cash, a few new ATM cards loaded with millions, and keys to a new house and a new car.\"\n\n\"Jesus, that's incredible! What was your next wish?\"\n\n\"I told you I was very lonely, right? Well I wanted a companion, someone to love. So I wished to be married to the most beautiful woman in the world. As soon as the last words left my lips, out of the water comes the most beautiful woman I had ever seen in my entire life. Absolutely gorgeous. The genie married us right then and there. It was absolutely wonderful. I had never been happier in my entire life.\"\n\n\"Well, Greg, this is definitely one of the most bizarre and incredulous stories I've ever heard. You've gotta finish it.\"\n\n\"Well, to be honest, all those things kind of went away with my orange head. I spent millions on reconstructive surgery and research to try and get rid of it, and my new wife wouldn't even look at me.\"\n\n\"Alright, you've gotta tell me about the head.\"\n\n\"Well, that's where I kind of fucked up.

If you do not return, we will hunt you down and kill you.\"   \n\nSo they all go out in different directions to look for their fruit.

The man worriedly starts putting an apple into his butt, then sliding it as far up as it will go. He gets the first one, then a second, and a third.

He gets the first few in easily, and seems on track to get all 10. However, as he finishes inserting the ninth cherry, he bursts out in uncontrollable laughter and all the cherries fall out.

He decided he was going to retire and buy a farm. So he buys a farm way out in the country, he gets cows, chickens, goats, and even dogs. A few months pass and no chickens are laying any eggs, so the man is very upset. He heads to town to the local feed store and asks the man what he can do to make the chickens lay eggs. The man says \u201cI can\u2019t help you but go down the road and this place can help you\u201d and hands him their card. So the man goes down the road, walks in and tells the man his problem.\n\nThe man says \u201cI have just what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d The man goes to the back and brings out Booster the Rooster, and says that will be $1500 dollars. The farmer is beyond shocked and says that it\u2019s a ripoff. The man guarantees that it will cure his problem. So the man buys Booster the Rooster and heads home.\n\nHe gets to his farm and lets Booster out, and zoom! Booster lines up all the chickens on the yard like a drill instructor, ordered by weight and color, and starts fucking all the chickens one by one, hitting them straight down the line like clockwork. The farmer is beyond amazed and says \u201cBooster! Calm down, your\u2019re gonna fuck yourself to death!\u201d \n\nThe next morning the man looks outside and there are eggs EVERYWHERE. He runs inside, grabs the wife and kids, and they all scoop up eggs. He then looks over and sees Booster ordering all the cows by weight and color, then going down the line fucking all the cows. The man yells \u201cGod damn Booster, your going to fuck yourself to death!\u201d After that the man calls it a night.\n\nHe comes out the next day and there are eggs everywhere again. He gets his wife and kids out to pick them up again. He looks around and sees the chickens and the cows just laying there, tongues all hanging out and stunned. He looks around for Booster and sure enough, Booster is fucking the dog. The man says \u201cGod damn Booster, you are going to fuck yourself to death!\u201d The man calls it a night and goes inside.\n\n\n\nHe comes out the next morning and there is a huge hole in the fence, and all the animals are gone. The man is beyond pissed, and sets out looking for the animals. Can\u2019t find his livestock, can\u2019t find his chickens, can\u2019t find his dog. Can\u2019t find Booster either. A few days pass by, but still nothing.\n\nOne morning he sees buzzards circling something.

Grandpa replied, \"I don't know Son, Can you touch your dick to your asshole?\" To which Bad Lil' Johnny sadly replied, \"No, Grandpa, I cannot.\"  Grandpa responded with, \"Then No, Son, You are not old enough.\" Awhile later, Grandpa pulled out a cigar, lit it, and began to puff out a few smoke rings.  Bad Lil' Johnny's curiosity led him to ask Grandpa for a puff of the cigar.  Grandpa simply replied, \"I don't know Son, Can you touch your dick to your asshole?\" To which Bad Lil' Johnny sadly replied again, \"No, Grandpa, I cannot.\" Grandpa responded with, \"Then No, Son, You are not old enough.\"  Awhile later, Bad Lil' Johnny began to get hungry, so he pulled out a bag of Oreos that his mom had packed for his fishing trip with Grandpa and began to eat some.  Grandpa, now feeling hungry, asked Bad Lil' Johnny if he could have an Oreo. Bad Lil' Johnny asked, \"I don't know Grandpa, Can you touch your dick to your asshole?\" to which Grandpa proudly relpied, \"Yes Son, I sure can!\" Bad Lil' Johnny smiled and looked his Grandpa in the eyes and simply said, \"Good...

So what's your story?\" \n\nSo the first man replies: \"Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell -- but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony.\" \n\n\"That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,\" said Peter, and let the man in. \n\nThe second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. \n\n\"It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I'm here.\" \n\nOnce again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death. \n\nThe third man came to the front of the line, and again Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story. \n\n\"Picture this,\" says the third man, \"I'm hiding inside a refrigerator...\" ",

Thomas was welcomed by Brother John, who gave him a tour of the monastic life. Thomas was excited and eager to join.\n\nBrother John laid out the conditions of induction into the order. Before Thomas would be accepted he would need to complete a 3 year probationary period. \n\nDuring this time, Brother John explained, Thomas would have to strictly adhere to vow of silence and could not communicate in any way with anyone.  At the end of each year, Thomas would be allowed to speak only one word. If he passed the 3 year probation satisfactorily, he would be become a full brother of the order.\n\nThomas, thinking, what is such a small sacrifice for service to the Lord, agreed and began his 3 year probation. \n\nLife is the monastery was calm, and Thomas passed his time with study of the monks and Benedictine order.  \n\nThen, about halfway through the first year he ran out of toothpaste. What could he do? He had to suffer with nasty breath and teeth until when the year was up he was allowed to speak his one word for the year:\n\n\"Toothpaste\" he said. The other brothers understood and brought him some toothpaste.\n\nThe second year started well, but he popped a button off his tunic, and it let the cold air of winter in, chilling him to the bone. That was a tough and long winter for Thomas!\n\nFinally the second year was up and his chance to say his one word. Thomas said, \"Button.\"  The bothers understood and sewed a new button on his tunic. \n\nDuring his last year, Thomas thought he was in the home stretch and all would be fine when the buckle on his sandal broke and made a clanking sound whenever he walked. The noise worried Thomas, who was naturally humble and self-conscious.\n\nAt last the 3rd year of his probation ended, and he spoke his one word, \"Buckle.\"  The bothers understood and fixed the buckle on his sandal.\n\nAs it was the end of his probation, Thomas was brought before the council of monks where they reviewed his record.  \n\nAfter some deliberation and whispered discussion, Brother John looked at Thomas and said:\n\n\"Well Thomas, we're afraid that you are not a good fit here.  We've decided that you have failed your probation.\"\n\nThomas was crestfallen. He'd done everything they wanted without error, and took great pleasure in the pious service of the Lord. \n\nThomas pleaded, \"Why?\"\n\nBrother John looked at him and said,\n\n\"The problem is, all you ever do is complain.\"\n",

Search twitter @gizopizo for more :)\n\nSan Jose, CA - MyDarkSpace, the company behind the popular productivity tools WhyPatricide and GettingAwayWithIt, are completing their newest venture in antisocial networking. iEnemies, available soon for iOS and Andriod, is geared for those ready to take their death threats and murderous intent to the next level. \n \n\"When it comes to grudges and revenge, we here at MyDarkSpace are all about synchronicity,\" says Chief Developer Lance Toddman. \"We want our users to be able to engage with their vengeance plots wherever they are. See an old high school bully at your kid's soccer game? Just take out your phone, open the app, and drag them to the top of the list. Find out that first boss you hated so much died in a car accident six months ago? Just press and hold on his name, then swipe left to delete. And managing your kill queue is just the beginning,\" says Toddman.\n\niEnemies offers a tiered pricing structure that allows customers to access enhanced features. \"Got your own tracking method that works for you? That's fine by us. You can use the free version for as long as you want,\" says MyDarkSpace Vice President Mary Hulbert. \"But for a small monthly fee, we can do things like track all your foes down and email you their home and work addresses. Also, we'll let you know if they move, get a new job, or experience a major life event like the birth of a child.\"\n\nAnother optional add-on is Easiest4U, which uses a proprietary algorithm to determine which of your enemies should be at the top of your list. \"Basically, we take all the data you can provide about the people you hate, and run that against things like their distance from you, their wealth, potential protection, and dozens of other factors to recommend a manageable list that will challenge you, but not overwhelm you,\" explains Toddman.\n\nAlso available for a fee is access to the world wide community of iEnemies users. You can share your lists with others, as well as upload schedules, goals, and even pictures of your accomplishments. \n\n\"Perhaps the most exciting thing of all is that iEnemies works seamlessly with our whole suit of revenge products,\" says Hulbert. \"Maybe you're ready for that first kill, but unsure how to proceed. iEnemies will sync with GettingAwayWithIt in seconds and you'll have a custom made plan built just for you that practically guarantees success. The possibilities are as limitless as your death list.\u201d\n\niEnemies is now in beta for Android and will be for iPhone as soon as they complete the App Store approval process.\n",

After being rejected several times, they came to a 2-acre, unkempt property. They were greeted at the front by an old blind woman. \n\n\"Excuse me ma'am, but would you be able to spare us some food?\"\n\nThe woman thinks for a moment, and replies \"I'll give you a warm, homecooked meal on one condition: You must earn your food by having sex with me.\"\n\nTwo of the beggars decide that the offer isn't appealing enough, and head off down the road. The third, desperate and starving, follows the woman into her home.\n\nNot wanting to stay longer than needed, the man says \"let's get to business,\" then, looking out the window, he gets an idea. \"On second thought, how would you like to do the dirty outside? It's a beautiful day out, huh ma'am?\"\n\n\"Hmm? Oh, well, why not? Show the way, chief.\"\n\nSo the homeless man leads his blind mistress to the acre behind her house, to a field of corn. He lays her down on the soft grass, grabs an ear of corn, and proceeds to fucking her with the cob. After a couple of minutes using one cob, he would toss it over the fence and start fresh with a new ear. This process continued for about an hour.\n\nFinally, imitating exhaustion, the man tells his host that he has finished. Pleased with the experience, the old woman fulfills her end of the bargain by feeding the beggar.\n\nThe man leaves the house, and is promptly greeted by his buddies. \n\n\"How was your food, mate? I mean the one on the plate, not the one in adult pampers.\" \n\n\"It wasn't too bad, actually. I took her out to the fields--\"\n\n\"Oy, we don't need to hear the details. But get this.

You guys are wonderful! This haircut is free!\" \n\nThe Trappist says, \"Oh, no, no, no. Even though we live simply, I have money for a haircut. Please let me pay you.\" \n\n\"Oh no,\" says the barber. \"This haircut is free.\" So the Trappist thanks him, gives him a blessing and leaves. \n\nThe next day the barber comes to his shop and on his doorstep, there is a surprise waiting for him. A big basket full of cheeses and jams made by the Trappist abbey, along with a thank-you note from the Trappist. \n\nThat same day another man walks into the barbershop wearing a black suit and a clerical collar. After he sits down the barber says, \"Excuse me, but why are you dressed like that?\" \n\nAnd the man says, \"Yes. I'm a Jesuit priest. I'm in town for a theology conference.\" \n\nAnd the barber says, \"Oh, I love the Jesuits! You know, my son went to Santa Clara and my daughter went to Loyola Marymount. I love Ignatian spirituality and I've been to the retreat house you have in town. You guys are great! This haircut is free!\" \n\nAnd the Jesuit says, \"Oh no, no, no. I take a vow of poverty but I have enough money for a haircut.\" \nThe barber says, \"Oh no. This haircut is free.\" So the Jesuit thanks him, gives him a blessing and is on his way. \n\nAnd the next day the barber comes to his shop and on his doorstep, there is a surprise waiting for him: ten more Jesuits.

How is that not fucking clear?\"\n \nIn 2012, the AMPTP updated their regulations regarding genres, casting, and settings, among a host of other revisions.\n \n\"Where is our show with people sprouting wings or turning into demons or some shit?\" Greenblatt asked the group. This was in reference to the AMPTP provision requiring one \"fantasy/fairy tale program\" per network.\n \n\"And where the hell is our dwarf?\" Greenblatt reportedly shouted, before turning and apologizing to his vice president of public relations, Brian Steel. \"I'm sorry, Brian. I meant 'little person',\" Greenblatt said while holding up quote signs with his fingers. \"And how many gays do we have this next season? More than one, but no more than three, right? And none of them in a leading role, you better fucking hope to God. Also, let's get a recount on our Blacks and Hispanics. I don't want one more than necessary!\"\n \nGreenblatt also expressed anger with his network\u2019s inability to comply with the \u201c50/25/25\u201d rule, which requires \u201chalf of all programming to be set in or around New York City, a quarter of the programming set in Los Angeles or similar environs,\u201d and the remaining quarter up to the discretion of the network, but \u201cpreferably somewhere with either a lot of trees or white beaches.\u201d\n \nThe penalty for failing to meet AMPTP standards are unclear, but sources say they might include having to finance a Two Broke Girls spin-off and airing the Tony Awards.\n\n(This is my very first reddit post.

Steve has some good friends that he knows through work. One of his best friends is named Wally. Wally's wife had come down with pneumonia, so Wally, who is assigned to deliver a truckload of bowling balls through a storm, asks Steve to take care of the delivery for him. Being such a kind-hearted person, Steve agrees.\n\nSteve leaves early because he knows that the storm would require him to drive slower, and he wanted the bowling balls to be shipped on time. While Steve is driving his truck down a street, he sees a young black man walking back to his house. Steve stops at a red light and thinks about what Jesus would do. He quickly steps out of his car and yells to the black man, \"Hey bud! Need a ride?\" even though it's against company policy to pick up hitch hikers. The young black man accepts his offer.\n\nSteve opens the back of the truck and he and the young black man both step in. The young black man introduces himself as Jared. Steve explains to Jared that, due to company policy, he is not allowed to pick up hitch hikers, and thus can't allow the dripping wet Jared into the cab of the truck with him, as his boss would see and thus know he'd broken policy. Watching Jared's face fall, Steve quickly clarifies that he can still drop him off wherever he needs to go after he makes his delivery, if only Jared would ride in the back with the bowling balls. Jared understands and thanks Steve for his kindness, then watches, smiling warmly, as Steve exits the back and walks back around to the front of the car.\n\nSteve continues driving Wally's route to the new bowling alley through the raging storm. About 2/3 of the way to his destination, driving up a hill, he passes another young black man, but this one is riding a bicycle. Steve can tell that he's struggling to pedal at the steep angle, so he pulls over and puts on his hazards. He invites the young black man into the back of the truck, just as he did with Jared. With the 3 of them and a bike semi-cozy, they begin to chat in the back of the truck. Steve explains the situation to the second young black man (whose name is Trey) and he also agrees to wait out the delivery with Jared.\n\nThe two young black men continue to chat as the truck rumbles along the route, discussing the kindness and openheartedness of Steve. Soon, they feel the truck come to a stop and hear other voices outside the truck. They press their ears to the sides of the truck to listen.\n\n\"License and registration, sir?\" Says a voice.\n\"Of course, officer. What's this all about?\" Replies Steve's voice.\n\"Just a standard check. There's been an increase of drug smuggling recently and we're really cracking down. Hey, George, would you go check the back for me?\" Says the first officer.\n\nTrey and Jared listen to Officer George's boots crunch along the gravel to the back, then watch in fear as he unlocks the back and takes a look inside.\n\nOfficer George stares blank faced for a few seconds at Jared and Trey, standing among the bowling balls with a bicycle. After about 8 seconds had passed, Officer George closes the back and walks around to the front of the truck. \n\nHe says, in a quiet voice, \"Hank, let them go.\"\n\"Huh? I haven't ran their plates yet, George. Hold on a minute.\"\n\"YOU DONT UNDERSTAND, HANK. LET THEM GO!\" he yells.\n\nOfficer Hank waves them forward frantically, knowing his partner doesn't joke about when it comes to danger.\n\nConfused but relieved, Steve drives away with Jared, Trey, and Trey's bike still in the back with all the bowling balls.\n\nAfter the truck leaves, Officer Hank asks Officer George, \"What the hell was that all about, man?!\"\n\nGeorge replies, in absolutely horror, \"That truck was full of nigger eggs!! Two had hatched and one had already stolen a bike!!\"",

With such a long distance travelled, he decides to wet his whistle in one of the West Countries many pub. As we all know however, these are not the friendliest of places...\n\nSo the Alien walks into the bar, and all goes quite. Grizzled men stare from beneath their pints, this guy is clearly not a local. Unphased by the menacing atmosphere, the alien walks to the bar and asks for a pint of cider. The bartender, glancing at the locals as if to wonder who this guy is in their pub, responds with \"Sorry mate, we don't serve your kind in here\". The Alien looks shocked, but he is determined to get a drink. He puts his long, grey arm around one of the locals; an old farmer who has clearly seen better days,  and says \"tell you what, i'll buy this fella' a drink as well, if i can have a cider.\" The bartender looks unmoved, and repeats his statement \"sorry mate, no can do.\" \n\nWell, at this point the alien sighs, and points to a table of young lads, enjoying a round. He says \"tell you what, i'll be these fine gentleman a round as well.\" Well by now people are beginning to support the alien, especially as he is now buying drinks for half the pub. Sadly the barkeep repeats his rhetoric, \"nah mate, can't do it\". \"Fine\" the Alien says, \"I'll buy everyone in the pub a round, as well as all the peanuts they want for the rest of the night\". A few men stand up now, cheery faces, and slap the alien on the back like an old mate. \"Come on mate\" they say, \"let him have what he wants\". The bartender, seeing how the whole pub is now supporting the alien, finally agrees. He goes to grab the long awaited pint glass when the alien stops him....\n\n\"Sorry mate, have you got change for a Zog?\"\n\nFollow the punchline with hysteric laughter for a good minute for true success",

Although, to be honest, isn't it all relative? I mean, if my car breaks down, suddenly I live a lot more than 10 minutes from there.\n\nThey're known of course for their firearms, but they also make golf clubs. No matter what you're buying from Ruger, you're obviously aiming for a hole in one.\n\nYou know, even while working there, I had had no clue that they make golf clubs. I think they make them in Arizona, where all the old retired people who have nothing better to do than to play golf are. Genius.\n\nYou know what else was smart? They put really uncomfortable seats in the cafeteria. Boy, I tell you what, after a few minutes of sitting on them, being on your feet for a few more hours didn't seem so bad.\n\nThey had quite a few vending machines, and they had the most diabolical setup I've ever seen. They had a machine that every once in a while would spit out an extra Mtn Dew. That machine only took ones and coins, the lying piece of shit. So you had to get change from the change machine...that would almost always shortchange you. You had ONE JOB! I swear, that's the kind of problem that you would have to specifically program the machine to do.\n\nI fell victim to the setup, man. I was playin' that Coke Machine...yes, it was a Coke Machine that just happened to serve Pepsi products. That's not part of a joke, that's just an important bit of information so you know that my story doesn't have a continuity error. I was playin' that Coke Machine like it was the slots. Although really, what's the jackpot? Diabetes?\n\nTo be fair though, there was a card you could fill out and eventually your supervisor will bring your change to you. Very vague, you just had to have faith that at SOME point, somehow, somewhere, your supervisor would bring your money in some form or another. He brought it to me in an envelope and said \"Here's your paycheck.\" Real funny guy.\n\nIt wasn't too bad, though, they let you listen to music. That was nice. Although when Pink Floyd is telling me to breathe in the air, all I can think is, \"it's called coolant.\" Because that's what you breathe when working on those CNC machines is coolant that smells like a cat piss-soaked couch.

A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. 'Does it still look like it is going to be a very cold winter?'\n\n'Yes,' the man at National Weather Service again replied, 'it's going to be a very cold winter.'\n\nThe chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of firewood they could find. Two weeks later, the chief called the National Weather Service again. 'Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?'\n\n'Absolutely,' the man replied. 'It's looking more and more like it is going to be one of the coldest winters we've ever seen.'\n\n'How can you be so sure?' the chief asked.\n\nThe weatherman replied, 'The Indians are collecting a shitload of firewood'.",

Both sides wanted the bragging rights in that event, and they stopped at nothing to get the edge.  And so, deep in the wastelands of Siberia, the Soviets brought all of their knowledge of genetics and selective breeding to bear and created the fastest, strongest wrestler they'd ever produced.  On top of this genetic edge, their coaches developed a foolproof move called the Pretzel Hold, out of which no wrestler had ever broken free.  And so, this superhuman Soviet wrestler destroyed all of the competition in the Communist world, finally winning the gold medal in the Warsaw Pact games.  He was undefeated.  The Americans, however, were also preening a champion -- a farm boy from Iowa who was born to two ordinary midwesterners and fed a steady diet of beef, corn, and apple pie.  But, he became immensely strong working on the farm lifting hay bales, digging ditches, and hiking over mountains, streams, and fields.  He was a monster of a man, and also unstoppable.  \n\nAnd so, these two wrestlers met -- each undefeated -- in the gold medal round of the Olympics.  The American coach turned to his guy and said, \"You're good enough to beat him, but keep out of that Pretzel Hold.  No one has ever gotten out of it.\"  Full of pride and youthful enthusiasm, the American wrestler nods and walks out on the mat to confront the Soviet terminator.  The whistle blows, and then SUDDENLY, in two seconds, the American is in the pretzel hold.  The coach covers his eyes and hears the count -- 1 - 2 - 3 BANG!  He looks up and the American wrestler has won!!\n\nAs his wounded warrior limps off the mat, the Coach grabs him.  \"You were in the pretzel hold!\"  \"I was,\" the American says, as he falls to his knees.  \"How did you break free?!\" \n\n\"Well,\" the American says, straining to find the energy in his broken body, \"he was faster than I could have imagined.  BAM!  I was in the Pretzel Hold.  And as things started to go dark and I knew the end was near, I looked up and saw these TWO BIG HAIRY BALLS.  And so I craned my neck as far as I could and I bit those BALLS.\"\n\n\"Oh my god,\" the Coach cried.\n\n\"Yeah,\" the American said, \"you don't know how strong you are until you bite your own balls.\"",

The farmer said, 'Well, as a matter of fact, my farm is very close to that house I would walk you there but I can't carry this lot.'\n\nThe old lady suggested, 'Why don't you put the can of paint in the bucket. Carry the bucket in one hand, put a chicken under each arm and carry the goose in your other hand?' 'Why thank you very much,' he said and proceeded to walk the old girl home.\n\nOn the way he says 'Let's take my short cut and go down this alley. We'll be there in no time..\n\nThe little old lady looked him over cautiously then said, 'I am a lonely widow without a husband to defend me... How do I know that when we get in the alley you won't hold me up against the wall, pull up my skirt, and have your way with me?'\n\nThe farmer said, 'Holy smokes lady! I'm carrying a bucket, a gallon of paint, two chickens, and a goose. How in the world could I possibly hold you up against the wall and do that?'\n\nThe old lady replied, 'Set the goose down, cover him with the bucket, put the paint on top of the bucket, and I'll hold the chickens.

Carrying firewood and what not.\nWhen all of sudden one day, *chug chug chug* it breaks down.\n\nSo he decides to go back to the shed to grab his tractor and tow it back.\nHe pulls apart his Datsun Ute and does all the fault finding and diagnostics you can imagine. He pulls apart the gearbox and finds a broken cog. \n\nSo he calls up the Datsun dealership and explains to him how his Datsun Ute broke down, and he needs a new cog for it. He asks if he could help him out. The dealership tells him \"Yeh mate, I can get one in for ya but it's going to take about 6-8 weeks.\" \nThe farmer says, \"why so long? I really need the Datsun cog for my Datsun Ute.\" \nThe man replies, \"Yeh sorry mate, the parts coming from Japan, nothing I can do.\" \nThe farmer says \"fair enough\" and hangs up the phone. He comes up with the idea to just fly over there himself and pick it up, as it's costing him money not having his Datsun ute running. \n\nHe buys a plane ticket to Japan expecting he's just going to get there and buy a Datsun cog and return home. He finally lands and makes his way to the Datsun factory. Out comes one of the workers and the farmer says to him, \"Mate, I'm after a Datsun cog for my Datsun ute.\" \nThe factory worker says \"Yeh no worries, but we're a factory, you can't just buy one Datsun cog. You have to buy a 1000 Datsun cogs minimum.\" \nThe farmer agrees and he takes a pallet of a 1000 Datsun cogs back onto the plane making his way home. \n\nAs the planes descending the planes to heavy for the landing gear and the flight attendants announce their going to throw out anything they deem as excessive. The flight crew are staring at a pallet of a 1000 Datsun cogs, thinking who would want a 1000, it's a Datsun.\n\nSo they decide to push it off the back of the plane. When at that moment the farmer comes racing in saying \"stop, stop!\". He reaches into the pile and grabs a Datsun cog out. And he's happy, as he got what he came for. So they push out the remainder, like 999 Datsun cogs, but let's just say a 1000, who's counting. \n\nSo you can imagine, a 1000 Datsun cogs are falling from the sky from a plane, what a sight that would be. 2 other farmers, Billy and Joel, sitting out on their sun deck see exactly that. Billy yells out, \"Joel! Wake up! It's raining Datsun cogs!\"",

So, deciding that it would do their son well to visit the old man for the summer, his parents packed him up and sent him to go stay with the old man for the summer.\n\n\nSo, upon his arrival, the boy found his grandfather and a very large, old dog sitting on the front porch attached to a completely ancient and rickety cabin, which he was later told by his relative that it had no running water, electricity, or air conditioning and that he should 'get used to roughin it'. The old man ushered the boy inside, saying that there was dinner already cooking for him on the stove; the dog following close behind. The boy looked around, and finally he sat down to eat with his grandfather, using the dinner plates left behind by his late grandmother.\n\n\nThe boy noticed that there were a few smudges and flecks of food still on the plate, but decided to say nothing about it and just continued to eat.\n\n\nThe same thing happened the next day, however the food he had eaten yesterday now resided upon the plate. \"Grandpa?\" he asked hesitantly, looking up to the old man. \"I don't think this is very clean...\" The old man shrugged.\n\n\"Well it's the best Cold Water can do, boy.\" Deciding that this was true, he said nothing, and continued to eat.\n\nThe *next* night, and every night after, the same thing happened, only with the previous night's meal still half-way caked onto the plate. The boy occasionally decided to speak up, and said, \"Grandpa the plate isn't clean.\" And, again, the old man would have just shrugged and said,\n\n\"It's the best Cold Water can do boy.\" The boy would then huff with a bit of annoyance, and after a while of this going back and forth, he just decided that he shouldn't speak of it again if this was going to be his answer every time.\n\nOne night, after dinner, the boy, his grandfather, and the dog all sat on the front porch enjoying the fireflies and the sounds of nature when the dog picked up the scent of a squirrel. Being the old hunting dog it was, he began to bark, and bark and bark and bark until the old man had enough of it and yelled,\n\n\"Cold Water! Be quiet!\"",

Critics agree it was all thanks to a magnificent best drama win for the hip-hop epic \"8 Mile: Rick Ross's Harrowing Struggle to Complete a 13K Diabetes Fun Walk\".\n\nEven more entertainment news, \"Mad Men\" has announced its final season air date. They even teased the series's big finale where Don Draper makes love to a sexy feral subway cat then comes up with the jingle for Meow Mix.\n\nA recent study has confirmed that the human male y-chromosome will not die off in the future despite initial worry. However, the y-chromosome will have a midlife crisis in six years during which it will insist all cell nuclei call it \"Da Y-Man\".\n\nIn tech news, Facebook announced it will begin to kill its much-loathed news feed ads. Instead, Facebook will just force each user to take monthly drunk selfies with the Pillsbury Dough Boy.\n\nOver to the political sphere, it seems that many are now doubting Governor Christie's electability as a presidential candidate. And that's not just because of Christie's controversial business ties to Big Canola Oil.\n\nIn a candid move, President Obama finally let the press photograph his lunch with Biden. The New York Times got a couple good shots of President Obama sharing a laugh with the Vice President while the Wall Street Journal snapped a few adorable pics of Biden with psketti all over his cheeks and bib.\n\nLast up, the President has announced he will be considering four NSA reforms. Three are mainly bureaucratic while the last reform is to name the NSA something less intimidating like \"Obama's Cuddly Jamboree of Encrypted Email Snooper Poopers\".\n\nThat's it for now.

He caught her out back trying self induction; fortunately, she had not damaged her solenoid. The two took off on his megacycle and rode across the Wheatstone Bridge into a magnetic field, next to a flowing current , to watch the sine waves. \n\nMicro Farad was very much stimulated by Millie's characteristic curve. Being attractive himself, he soon had her field fully excited. He set her on the ground potential, raised his frequency, lowered her resistance, and pulled out his high voltage probe. When he inserted it in parallel, he short-circuited her shunt. Fully excited, Millie cried out, \"ohm, ohm, give me mho\". As he increased his tube to maximum output, her coil vibrated from the current flow. It did not take long for her shunt to reach maximum heat. Now with the excessive current shortening her shunt, Micro's capacity rapidly discharged \u2013 every electron was drained off. But that was not the end of it. Indeed, they fluxed all night, tried various connections and hookings until his bar magnet weakened, and he could no longer generate enough voltage to sustain his collapsing field.

The bartender himself is confused, for not only is helium invisible to the naked eye in the absence of another object to contain it, should quickly dissipate. Furthermore, a cloud of helium, lacking any sort of motor system, is at the mercy of atmospheric currents and cannot enter a bar under its own power. It should not have been capable of opening the door to the bar. Even if it could, hypothetically, propel itself in such a manner, the lack of any semblance of a nervous system would make meaningful coordination difficult, if not impossible. And, if the cloud of helium has no nervous system, how can it think to enter a bar? How can it be self-conscious enough to know that it desires a drink? To question it is to question the nature of the self itself. What is the self? Is the self the physical body? But when the body is wounded, and, say, a limb is lost, the removed tissue is no longer considered part of the self. Is the self the consciousness? Yet nobody denies that an individual is no longer himself when he sleeps. Is the self a spiritual force, invisible and nebulous like the helium which provokes these questions? No scientific, empirical evidence of such exists; it is the domain of scholars, priests, and mortals who chase the shadows of the unknown. Who could say? It is a question that mankind has struggled to solve since the dawn of time without success.\n\nThe bartender is facing an existential crisis when he recalls the bar's policy towards noble gases and his psyche is once again put at ease. \"You're going to have to leave, we don't serve your kind here,\" he says, grunting at the mass of atoms.\n\nThe helium doesn't react",

I say we do \"Teletubbies: History of World War II\" and give a little history lesson right? The show opens with the first Teletubbie walkin out. He's Japan. And he's yellow. And he's dancin. And on top of his head is a little airplane flying downward. The next Teletubbie walks out and he's Russia, so he's red. And on top of his head is a little sickle and hammer. Now the third Teletubbie comes out dancing and he's Germany. We'll just make him green. And on top of his head is a little statue of himself with a tiny mustache pointing somewhere. Now the fourth Teletubbie walks out and he's blue. He's Great Britain. He has a little tea cup on his head. The fifth Teletubbie comes out and he's just brown. He sits in the corner and smokes a cigarette and does nothing. After all the Teletubbies are done dancing he says how much he danced and all the other Teletubbies call him out on his bullshit. He's France. At the end of the show while all the other Teletubbies are dancing a red, white, and blue Teletubbie rushes on to stage with a mushroom cloud on his head.

        "body": "Notes From An Inexperienced Chili Taster Named FRANK, who was visiting Texas from the East Coast: \n\n\"Recently I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking directions to the beer  wagon when the call came.  I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted. Here are the scorecards from the event:\n\n\n**Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili**\n\nJUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.\n\nJUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.\n\nFRANK: Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy.\n\n\n**Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili**\n\nJUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.\n\nJUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.\n\nFRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.\n\n\n**Chili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili**\n\nJUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.\n\nJUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of red peppers.\n\nFRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now, get me more beer before I ignite. The Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all the beer.\n\n**Chili # 4: Bubba's Black Magic**\n\nJUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.\n\nJUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.\n\nFRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it, is it possible to burn-out taste buds? Sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb. bitch is starting to look HOT, just like this nuclear waste I'm eating. Is chili an aphrodisiac?\n\n\n \n**Chili # 5: Linda's Legal Lip Remover**\n\nJUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very  impressive.\n\nJUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make  a strong statement.\n\nFRANK: My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off? It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those rednecks!\n\n**Chili # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety**\n\nJUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice and peppers.\n\nJUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb.\n\nFRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I shit myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally, she must be kinkier than I thought. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone!\n\n\n**Chili # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili**\n\nJUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.\n\nJUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should note that I am worried about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is  cursing uncontrollably.\n\nFRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit to match my damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. Screw it, I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.\n\n\n**Chili # 8: Helen's Mount Saint Chili**\n\nJUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all, not too bold but spicy enough to  declare its existence.\n\nJUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili, neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge Number 3 passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Yank, wonder how he'd have reacted to a really hot chili?\n\nFRANK: --------------(editor's note: Judge #3 was unable to report)\n",

To make things fair, he would require all newcomers to prove their worthiness by a trial.  \n\nThere were three couples who wanted to join his church:  an elderly couple, a middle-aged couple, and a new couple still in their early twenties.  The pastor met with them and explained the trial they would need to pass in order to join his congregation.  \n\n\"I've spoken with you before today, and I know that you're all married couples interested in joining my church.  Well, to join the church is to give up sin, which takes willpower.  This trial is a test of your willpower:  all of you must abstain from any sexual conduct for an entire month.  Once the month is over, we'll meet again and discuss how we did.\"  \n\nThe three couples all agreed, and after a month they all met up again.  \n\n\"How did you fare?\"  The pastor asked.  \n\nThe elderly couple responded first.  \"It wasn't really too difficult for us, it was business as usual for the most part.  After the month was over, we did have a nice romantic evening together though.\"  \n\n\"Welcome to the congregation, good children,\" the pastor said, and wished them on their way, saying that he'd see them at the next service.  He then turned to the middle-aged couple:  \"How about you, my children?\"  \n\n\"Well father, it was difficult, there were a couple days during the month that we didn't think we could resist, but we persevered and were able to make it through the month as required.\"  \n\n\"Wonderful, wonderful!  I'll be seeing you at the next service as well.  What about the two of you,\" he said to the young couple.  \n\n\"To be honest father, we couldn't make it through the month.  We did make it about 2 weeks without any sexual encounters, but I saw my love bend over and pick up an orange off the floor and it got me so excited that we made passionate love right on the spot.\"  \n\n\"I can understand, you're two people very much in love, and you are married so there is no sin.  However, I'm afraid that you cannot be welcomed in to the congregation, as you have failed the test.\"  \n\n\"That's OK Father, we're no longer welcome in the local grocery store either.\"  ",

They see up in the loft there are piles of hay which look heavenly to sleep upon.  One of the men says, \u201cI really need to sleep and there is no way he will ever know we went up there.  We should just go.\u201d  All three climb up into the loft and are asleep in no time.\n\nA few short hours later, they wake up with the farmer standing above them with a shotgun.  He says, \u201cI gave you one rule and you broke it.  I shall kill you all now.\u201d  In terror, the travelers exclaim that they will do anything for the man to make up for their actions.  He says, \u201cFine.  For me to spare you, you must go into the woods and return for more instructions with a fruit or vegetable.\u201d  \n\nRelieved, the three men set out and within no time, the first traveler comes back with a peach.

Left with no other choice, she decides to relieve herself a bit and lets out a dainty fart. It wasn't loud,but everyone at the table heard the pouf. Before she even had a chance to be embarrassed, her boyfriend's father looked over at the dog that had been snoozing at the woman's feet and said in a rather stern voice, \"Skippy!\". The woman thought, \"This is great!\" and a big smile came across her face. A couple of minutes later, she was beginning to feel the pain again. This time, she didn't even hesitate.

A few minutes later the woman had to let another one rip. This time she didn't even think about it. She let rip a fart that rivaled a train whistle blowing!

Quasi says to him, \"I'm sorry, I want to give you a chance I really do, but I just can't see how you could possibly do this without arms.\"\nThe man responds, \"I understand where you're coming from, but please just give me one chance and I promise you won't regret it.\"\nAgainst his better judgement, and because it was almost nine AM anyway, Quasi allowed the man one chance.\nSo they began the climb up the tower, and by the time they reached the top it was only a few seconds until nine. As Quasi began the countdown, he noticed the man tensing up and glaring at the bell.\n\"3...2...1 Go now!\" \nThe man fixed his feet and charged headfirst into the bell. The resulting ring was beautiful, in fact, it sounded better than anything Quasi had done in his years at the tower. The man staggered backwards and ran at the bell again.

Eventually the man caught sight of the bell again and rushed at it the final time. He struck it, staggered backwards...and fell out of one of the tower's windows and down into the courtyard below.\nQuasi ran for the window and peered downwards, but he couldn't see anything from such a great height. Quasi rushed back down the tower hoping that the man was somehow still alive, but unfortunately when he reached the crowd of spectators gathered below, he was told that the man had died from the fall.\nOne of the spectators asked Quasi if he knew the dead man's name, so that his family could be informed.

The restaurateur figures what the heck, what's one more, so he's says wearily, \"OK kid, can you play some classical music for me?\"\n\nThe young man sits down at the piano and plays the most beautiful classical music the restaurateur has ever heard, however he doesn't recognize the piece, so when the kid ends he says,\" Wow kid that was fantastic, but what is the name of that song?\" The kid said,\"Oh I wrote that myself. It's called *your mother's bloody tampon*.\" The restaurateur does a double take and says, \"Excuse me?\" and the kid says, \"That's the name of the song: *Your mother's bloody tampon*.\" \n\nThe restaurateur simply doesn't know what to say in response, so he asks the kid if he can play some jazz and again the kid proceeds to sit down and just blow this guy's socks off with snazziest jazz he's ever heard. But the restaurateur doesn't recognize this piece either, so when the kid finishes he says,\" What can I say kid? You're brilliant! But I've never heard that piece before: what's it called?\" the young man smiles and says \"Oh that's because I wrote that too. It's called *I'm fucking your dog*\". \n\nThe restaurateur says, \"Look kid I want to hire you so bad, but the names of your songs, well they're atrocious. I'll hire you, but only under one condition: you can *never*, I mean *never*, tell any of the patrons at the restaurant the names of any of your songs. Do we have a deal?\" The young man says, \"Sure no problem.\"\n\nThe restaurateur says, \"OK then come to the restaurant at 8 pm ready to play. You'll play for 2 hours, take half hour break, and then when you comeback you just take requests until closing time.\"\n\nSo the young man does his first shift, the crowd loves him, and after 2 hours announces, \"Ladies and gentleman, I'm going to take a half hour break, and when I come back, I'll take requests for whatever you want to hear.\"\n\nSo he goes on his break, gets a bite to eat, goes out for a smoke and then figures he better hit the can real quick before he has to go back out.

To the surprise of everyone in the restaurant, the man pulls a frog out of his pocket and sets it on the keys. The frog immediately begins to play concert quality music that could almost rival Beethoven himself. The manager is dumb founded but still skeptical. He tells the customer \"This is an amazing sight, but it would hardly cover the cost of your food. I'm afraid we can't fill your order\" The customer looks concerned for a moment before reaching into his pocket and pulling out a small mouse. He sets the mouse on the piano where it begins to sing the most beautiful song to go along with the piano music. The manager immediately has the man's order filled and he sits down to eat. Once the meal is finished the manager, thinking quickly, tells the customer \" I still feel like you owe me for the meal.\" The man who is angered by the display of greed turns to the manager and says \" Fine! how about you just keep the mouse and I'll be on my way.\" The manager gladly agrees and allows the customer to leave. As he exits the restaurant, his waiter comes up and apologizes for the manager's actions and asks \" Was giving away such a one of a kind mouse really worth a lunch tab?\" The man simply smiles and replies \" Not really.

Outlaw was small but didn't know it and the town fathers were  determined to impress the Count with their worldliness. They arranged to have the local orchestra perform Beethoven's Ninth Symphony at the school auditorium after the traditional rodeo and barbecue.\n\nThe Count arrives and is suitably impressed. At the barbecue he completely pigs out on steak, ribs, fried okra and cornbread. He has seconds of everything and thirds of some. Afterwards, he waddles to the auditorium and settles down to an evening of great music.\n\nUnfortunately, the orchestra had been invited to the barbecue and the barbecue had kegs of beer. By show time the two bass players were completely drunk and two of the tenors from the chorus were missing completely. Undaunted, the orchestra kicked in and got through the first movement with only minor mishaps.\n\nSince the school stage was fairly small, bringing the chorus on for the second movement entailed a lot of shuffling of chairs and in the confusion the directors score was knocked off its stand. Try as they might, they couldn't get it to stay on the stand again and in desperation, they tie it on with a string. Somewhat flustered, they gamely carried on until the schools overtaxed heating system kicked into overdrive and the ceiling fans started gyrating madly with a mighty racket.\n\nThe situation was practically unbearable. You could cut the tension with a knife. After all, it was the bottom of the ninth, the score was tied, the bass' were loaded with two men out, the count was full and the fans were going wild!",

The girl nods and climbs up a ladder to reach the raisin bread, which is located on the very top shelf. The young man, standing almost directly beneath her, gets an excellent view just as he planned. Once she comes down he says he should get two loaves, as he is having company for dinner. As the girl retrieves the second loaf of bread, one of the other male customers notices what is going on. Thinking quickly, he requests his own loaf of raisin bread so he can continue to enjoy the view. With each trip up the ladder, the young lady seems to catch the eye of another male customer. Pretty soon, each male customer is asking for raisin bread, just to see her climb up and down. After many trips she is tired, irritated and thinking that she is really going to have to try the bread herself. Finally, once again atop the ladder, she stops and fumes, glaring at the men standing below. She notices an elderly man standing amongst the crowd, staring up at her. Thinking to save herself a trip, she yells at the elderly man: \"Is it raisin for you, too?\" \"No,\" stammers the old man: \"but it's quivering a bit!\"",

Charlie ever since he was a young boy wanted to grow up to be a streer car conductor. When he finally became old enough, he applied for the job and lo and behold he got it. Now Charlie was the friendliest street conductor that the city has ever seen. Not only did he never complain about his job, but also he greeted everyone who boarded his street car and treated them like family. Everything in his life was perfect for Charlie until one day he decided to operate the street car after having a few drinks. In his drunken state, he crashed the streetcar and killed all the passengers. After going to court Charlie was sentences to death by the eletric chair. When the day came for his execution, a gaurd visited Charlie's cell and asked him what he wanted for his final meal. Charlie replied, \"I want a rotten tomato and a raw fish.\" After Charlie finished his meal he headed into the execution room and sat down in the eletric chair. The warden gave the order to pull the switch and the room went dark as thousands of volts passed through Charlies body. After the switch was thrown back it came as a suprise that Charlie was in fact still alive. Having no idea what else to do the warden let Charlie out of jail but banned him from ever operating a streetcar in New Orleans. Since street cars were his life Charlie decided \"Hey I'll go to Japan, I hear they have fancy new street cars there.\"  In Japan Charlie gets a job as a conductor again, but as before decides that after having a few drinks that he is still able to work the street car. To no suprise Charlie crashes the stree car and kills all the passengers. Charlie again finds himself in jail ordering his last meal. \"A rotten tomato and a raw fish,\" he tells the gaurd. After the meal was eaten, Charlie was led to the chair and once again survives the eletricity. Because he wasn't dying, he was set free but banned from operating the street cars in Japan. Charlie thought to himself, \"Well I heard San Francisco still has street cars operating so I'll go there.\" As you can guess Charlie ends up in the same situation and again orders the same meal \" A rotten tomato and a raw fish,\" he tells the gaurd. The warden from San Francisco had heard of Charlie and his previous death sentences so before he brought Charlie in to be executed he sent a letter to the mayor asking to reroute the city's eletricity to the jail. The mayor approved and confident with his new found power the warden smiled and gave the order to pull the switch. The lights in the room burst from the overload and the smell of something burning overwelmed the air. The warden after a minute ordered the gaurd to shut off the chair and as the smoke cleared, there was Charlie same as always. Distraught with emotion, the warden told Charlie to get out of his sights. Charlie, tired of going to jail, finally decided that maybe he shouldn't be a street car conductor after all. So Charlie travels back to New Orleans and meets his friend Thibodaux at a bar.  Thibodaux after a few minutes of small talk tells Charlie \"Everyone has heard about the eletric chair incidents and I just gotta axe, how were you able to survive all them jolts of electricity through your body? Was there something you did that made you resistant to it?\" Charlie looks at Thibodaux and says \"I dunno, I guess I was just a bad conductor.\"",

The third floor sign reads:\n\nFloor 3 -  These men Have Good Jobs, Love Children, and are Extremely Good Looking...\n\n'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.\n\nShe goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads: \n\nFloor 4 -  These men Have Very Good Jobs, Love Children, are Extremely Good Looking and Help With Most Housework...\n\n'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!'  \n\nStill, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:\n\nFloor 5 -  These men Have Exceptional Jobs that pay them very well, they Love Children, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with all the Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak, and they are 100% Faithful. \n\nShe is so  tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign  reads:\n\nFloor 6 - You are visitor 18,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This  floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. \n\nThank you  for shopping at the Husband Store. Please Exit to the right to make room for more unreasonable shoppers. \n\n\n\nPLEASE  NOTE:\n\nTo avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street. Similar instructions are posted at the entrance of this store as well.\n\nThe first floor has wives that love sex. \n\nThe second floor has wives that love sex and have their own money and like beer. \n\nThe  third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never been visited. \n",

Would you, by any chance, have any bottles of Pepsi please ?\nNow the butcher is really mad and tell him to come back when he knows what he want. \nThe customer went away wandering what was wrong. But even if he was a simple minded man he realized what he was doing wrong. So he goes back and this time he says \"Good Morning to you good man ! I would like to purchase 1 whole chicken, 2 steaks and 4 sausage links !\"\nThe butcher, grinning with all his teeth is in a really good mood and chat the customer about the temperature and other stuff while 'pretending' to make the customer order. After a few minutes, he steers the customer to the cash.\nThe customer asks \"How much will it comes to for my order ?\" \nThe butcher replies \"It comes to $17.54. Where are your empty bottles !\"",

He had tractor models, tractor wallpaper, remote control miniature tractors, tractor board games, even some tractor porn(which is not easy to find mind you). The only thing that even came close to his love for tractors, was the love he felt for his wife. His high school sweetheart, who didn't mind his infatuation with tractors one bit. She didn't even mind the role play where she would dress as a tractor, he would dress as a farmer, and he would take her for a \"ride\". Sadly his wife was struck one day, a tractor fell off the back of a transport truck. She didn't die until he was at her side in the hospital. Her dying words \"don't blame the tractor honey\" and with that she headed to the big farm in the sky. Sadly, he did blame the tractor, he hated them now with all his mind, body, and soul. He went home and destroyed ALL his tractor related items, the toys, his wifes tractor suit, and even his collection of tractor porn. He put it all in a pile and burned it in the yard. What ever didn't burn enough to his liking was thrown into a woodchipper. He then went inside, rarely leaving his home, for 8 years. Finally on the 8th anniversary of his darling wifes death he decided it was time to get back out in the dating world, plus the cute cashier at the grocery store had been asking him out for a while now, he called her out to dinner. The restaurant he choose ended up being quite nice, good food, good service, great decor. But there was one problem, it was EXTREMELY smoky. So smoky that his date, being an asthmatic, was having some trouble breathing. After noticing her displeasure, and trouble breathing, he started breathing in. I mean REALLY breathing in. Inhaling with such force that all the smoke quickly left the dining room, and went into his lungs. When the room was void of smoke he stepped outside and released it all into the night. When he rejoined his date she asked \"how on earth did you do that?\" to which he replied, \"I'm an extractor fan.\"",

Ving didn't give a shit. I drove Ving down to the town hall, and Ling tagged along. Ving goes to the desk and asks for a form and pulls out her birth certificate. I was surprised that she was really going to change her name. As she starts filling out the forms, she started to cry because of ancestral spirits and shit. She decides she didn't want to change her name. The lady at the desk says that there is a fee to cancel the name change (stupid-ass small-town laws). Ving tells Ling to pay for the fee since Ving didn't have money. As Ling was about to pay, she was interrupted by her father. Their Dad runs up to Ving and says \"Don't stop, be Lee, Ving. Hold on to the fee, Ling.\"",

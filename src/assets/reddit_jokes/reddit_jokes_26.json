I wanted to pass it on in case you haven\u2019t heard about it. A \u2018heads up\u2019 for those men who may be regular customers at Lowe\u2019s, Home Depot, Costco, or even Wal-Mart. This one caught me totally by surprise. Over the last month I became a victim of a clever scam while out shopping. Simply going out to get supplies has turned out to be quite traumatic. Don\u2019t be naive enough to think it couldn\u2019t happen to you or your friends.\nHere\u2019s how the scam works; Two nice looking, college-age girls will come over to your car or truck as you are packing your purchases into your vehicle. They both start wiping your windshield with a rag and Windex, with their breasts almost falling out of their skimpy T-shirts. (It\u2019s impossible not to look). When you thank them and offer them a tip, they say \u2018No\u2019 but instead ask for a ride to McDonald\u2019s.\nYou agree and they climb into the vehicle. On the way, they start undressing. Then one of them starts crawling all over you, while the other one steals your wallet.\nI had my wallet stolen Aug. 4th, 9th, 10th, twice on the 15th, again on the 17th, 20th, 24th, and the 29th. Also Sept. 1st, 4th, 8th, twice on the 10th &11th, and very likely again this upcoming weekend.\nSo tell your friends to be careful. What a horrible way to take advantage of us older men. Warn your friends to be vigilant.\nWal-Mart has wallets on sale for $2.99 each. I found even cheaper ones for $.99 at the Dollar Store and bought them out in three of their stores.\nAlso, you never get to eat at McDonald\u2019s. I\u2019ve already lost 11 pounds just running back and forth from Lowe\u2019s, to Home Depot, to Wal-Mart.\nSo please, send this on to all the men that you know and warn them to be on the lookout for this scam.

The first man tells St Peter he had some ill conceived business trips on the side indeed but on the whole loved his wife.

Pete swerved to avoid the cat but plowed right into a tree.\n\nThe next thing the men knew, they were in what appeared to be a white and cloudy waiting room. They looked at each other, shocked, and thought that they must be in heaven.\n\nBefore they could speak to each other, a loud voice spoke up and called to the first man.\n\n\"Pete, report to room 13\". the first man nervously looked at his friends and walked down the hallway to room 13.\n\nPete turned the knob of the door and stepped inside. On the other end of the room was a vicious lion. The lion was roaring, gnashing its teeth, and tearing at the ground.\n\nThe loud voice boomed...\n\n \"Pete, you have sinned. You must spend 10,000 years in this room before you can enjoy the fruits of heaven.\"\n\nAt that, the door slammed shut and locked. Johnny and Mike couldn't believe their ears. What a terrible fate for their friend, but before they could nervously bicker with each other the voice boomed again.\n\n\"Mike, report to room 5.\"\n\nAfter hearing this, Mike was terrified. He looked over to Johnny but started inching down the hallway to room 5. When he got there, he turned the knob and walked into the room.\n\nOn the other end of the room, there is a pack of huge and ferocious hyenas growling and biting at each other. They were howling wildly and snarling, now bringing their gaze to Mike.\n\nThe loud voice boomed...\n\n\"Mike, you have sinned. You must spend 50,000 years in this room before you can enjoy the fruits of heaven.\"\n\nNo sooner had the sentence been heard did the door slam shut and lock.\n\nJohnny is standing alone now, terrified. There is no doubt that Pete and Mike were both saints compared to him.\n\nAs Johnny is staring down the hallway, the voice booms...\n\n\"Johnny, report to room 1.\" \n\nJohnny looks down at the ground, and as slow as possible shuffles to the big door of room #1. He turns the knob and walks in with his eyes closed.\n\nHe opens his eyes and on the other end of the room he sees Scarlett Johansson standing there, naked. He cant believe his eyes, rubbing them in disbelief.\n\nThe loud voice booms...\n\n\"Scarlett Johansson, you have sinned.\"",

As he takes his seat at the bar and orders a beer, an elderly gentleman takes the seat next to him and orders the same.  After a few minutes of silence and contemplation, the elderly man leans over and says 'have you been here before?'\n\n'I have' Fred replied, 'but not in a good while'.  They make small talk for moment, and then the elderly gentleman says something quite outlandish.  'The bar recently added this new shot' he told Fred with a hint of a grin.  'I can't explain it, but for a minute or so after drinking, you feel as though you can fly'. Taking the old man for a drunk, but not wishing to be rude, Fred simply smiled and said something about strong drinks and college days.  \n\nBut the elderly man was adamant.  With a sudden exuberance, he called over the barkeep and ordered a double of the drink in question.  As Fred looked on, bewildered, the elderly man made his way to the window, shot in hand, and downed it in one fluid, experienced motion.  \n\nFred half leaped, half stumbled from his chair, moving as fast as his tired legs would take him towards the window, and the disillusioned old man who was climbing onto the ledge.\n\nWhat happened next caused Fred to drop his glass and gape in awe.  As he stood, dumbfounded, there was the elderly man, hovering in place as a cool breeze crept into the 9th floor pub.  He hovered there, wordless and motionless for what felt like hours, but in reality was only a quarter minute.  The elderly man then slowly floated back to the window, caught the ledge with his left foot and stepped back inside as if he had simply been walking down a flight of stairs.\n\nFred blinked, opened his mouth, then closed it again, as if he were going to speak before realizing he had no words to offer.  The elderly man walked quietly back to the bar and calmly took his seat.  'You just floated in mid air!!' Fred screamed, finally able to form thoughts. The elderly man stared straight ahead into the eyes of his own reflection in the mirror behind the bar.  \n\n'It's a pretty special drink' he said dryly.  \n\nWithout hesitation, Fred sprinted to the bar, poured himself the shot, downed it, and then sprinted back to the window.  Without breaking stride, he leapt out the open window, and for a brief moment felt completely weightless.  A few fractions of a second later he was hurtling towards the asphalt, too paralyzed with fear even to scream.\n\nBack in the 9th floor pub, the barkeep walked calmly over to the window, closed and latched it, then looked back over at the bar.  The old man was still gazing absently into the mirror, stirring a fresh highball with his straw. \n\nThe bar tender sighed and said 'You're an asshole, Mr. Kent.'  ",

He was a master of his art and his fame spread through all of the provinces of the Empire. There were many executions in those days, and sometimes as many as fifteen or twenty men to be beheaded at any one session. Wang Lun's habit was to stand at the foot of the scaffold with an engaging smile, hiding his curved sword behind his back, and while whistling a pleasant tune, to behead his victim with a swift movement as he walked up the scaffold.\n\nNow this Wang Lun had one secret ambition in his life, but it took him fifty years of strenuous effort to realize it. His ambition was to be able to behead a person with a stroke so swift that, in accordance with the law of inertia, the victim's head would remain poised on his trunk, in the same manner as a plate remains undisturbed on the table if the tablecloth is pulled out under it with a sudden jerk.\n\nWang Lun's great moment came in the seventy-eighth year of his life. On that memorable day he had to dispatch sixteen clients from this world of shadows to their ancestor's. He stood as usual at the foot of the scaffold, and eleven shaven heads had already rolled into the dust after his inimitable master-stroke. His triumph came with the twelfth man. When this man began to ascend the steps of the scaffold, Wang Lun's sword flashed with such lightening speed across his neck that the man's head remained where it had been before, and he continued to walk up the steps without knowing what had happened. When he reached the top of the scaffold, the man addressed Wang Lun as follows:\n\n\"O cruel Wang Lun, why do you prolong my agony of waiting when you dealt with the others with such merciful and amiable speed?\"\n\nWhen he heard these words, Wang Lun knew that the work of his life had been accomplished. A serene smile appeared on his features; then he said with exquisite courtesy to the waiting man:\n\n\"Just kindly nod, please.\"",

Republican efforts to try to sort out the so-called worthy from those likely to become public charges is fundamentally inhumane. What society on the planet is more able to afford the burdens of sustaining the indigent, distressed, and demoralized human beings of the world?\"\n\nPress Secretary Josh Earnest denied that the recently completed election answered Obama's taunt last year that \"if you don't like my policies, go out and win an election.\" \"Tuesday's election results don't meet what we consider the minimum threshold for overturning Administration policy on any issue,\" Earnest defiantly declared. \"They don't change anything. As the President has pointed out, two-thirds of registered voters didn't vote. Their silence can be taken as strong evidence of their satisfaction with the way things are going. They had every opportunity to go out and vote against the President's policies, but they didn't. We're pretty confident that this is a solid mandate to stay the course for the President's agenda.\"\n\n\"Let's also not forget that the US Government is the most important organization on Earth,\" Earnest added. \"That makes President Obama, as the ruler of America, the most important person on Earth. He has a duty to act for the benefit of all mankind and cannot let a disagreeable Congress impede his fulfillment of this duty.\"\n\nIn related news, Attorney General Eric Holder defended his practice of calling political opponents \"idiots.\" \"If we act all polite it conveys a message of possible legitimacy to their point of view,\" Holder said. \"That's the exact opposite of what we're trying to achieve. In contrast, an idiot's point of view has no legitimacy. It merits no consideration. It shouldn't even be aired much less listened to.\"\n\nLandrieu off to Bad Start in Louisiana Runoff Election\n\nIncumbent Senator Mary Landrieu (D-Louisiana) got off to a bad start in her desperate bid to hold onto her seat. In an attempt to characterize her Republican opponent Bill Cassidy as \"unreliable\" and \"undependable,\" Landrieu demanded to know what he had done to help the state recover from 2005's Hurricane Katrina.\n\nCassidy, an MD, responded that he had been working to provide medical aid to refugees of the storm. With help from friends and neighbors he and his physicians' group set up an emergency treatment center in an abandoned K-Mart.\n\nLandrieu shruugged this off as \"small potatoes. While my opponent was treating a handful of individual victims I was addressing the bigger problem\u2014the incompetence of the Bush Administration. I might not have directly saved anyone's life at that time, but I helped lay the groundwork for Democrats to take control of both Houses of Congress in the 2006 elections. Without this majority, President Obama's Affordable Care Act would never have passed in 2010.\"\n\nJoel DiGrado, Cassidy for Senate campaign manager, thanked Landrieu \"for clarifying the distinction between the two candidates. It could hardly be more clear that Bill Cassidy is a man of action and a person with a heart. He saw a need and took steps to meet it. In contrast, Landrieu touts her political hectoring of former President Bush and her role in paving the way for Obamacare. It will now be up to voters to decide which of these approaches to problem solving they'd like to see from their state's Senator.\"\n\nCity Seizes Art Studio\n\nThe Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority (PRA) has received court approval of its seizure of the art studio of James Dupree. It plans to bulldoze it and sell the land to a private grocery chain. Despite renovating a dilapidated warehouse and converting it into an attractive and bustling center for artistic expression, Dupree's property rights are being sacrificed to the PRA's vision of what the City needs.\n\n\"It's a question of whether the rights of the collective community should take precedence over the rights of a single individual,\" PRA Executive Director Ed Covington explained. \"Far more people will eat the food sold at the proposed supermarket than will ever see the works of art produced or displayed at Mr. Dupree's studio. Social justice commands that the benefit of the greater number takes precedence over the rights of one man.\"\n\nCovington dismissed the possibility that the supermarket could be built at another location. \"I suppose that if we were to search hard enough we might find such a place, but it might not be as conveniently located,\" he said. \"Should we really undermine the convenience of thousands of shoppers in the name of the abstract property rights of a single individual?\"\n\nIRS Admits It Didn't Really Look for Lois Lerner's \"Lost\" Emails\n\nIRS Commissioner John Koskinen admitted that it didn't exercise much effort to track down emails cited in an investigation of IRS abuses involving harassment of conservative political organizations.\n\n\"Look, we were between a rock and a hard place,\" Koskinen contended. \"On the one hand, we have Congress and the Courts demanding we produce these documents. On the other hand, some very powerful and dangerous people were very determined that these documents never be found.\"\n\n\"If we defy Congress and the Courts the worst case scenario is we get held in contempt,\" Koskinen pointed out. \"It's embarrassing. We look like crooks to the average American. But if we defy the President, well, he has people who can make you disappear or meet with an untimely accident. Given this same choice I don't think there's anyone who would have done it differently.\"\n\nCongresswoman Proposes Barack Obama Sperm Bank\n\nRep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex) says she will introduce legislation that would establish a federally funded Barack Obama sperm bank in the upcoming \"lame duck\" session of Congress. She says she got the idea from a similar proposal to establish a Vladimir Putin sperm bank in Russia.\n\n\"We can't afford to fall behind in what could turn out to be a critical competition to propagate the seed of the nation's best and brightest,\" Lee argued. \"Granted, it would be decades before the offspring of President Obama's banked sperm could be expected to make a strategic difference, but if we fail to act now we will come up short at a possibly crucial time in the future.\"\n\nAccording to Lee, a socially beneficial byproduct of this strategically oriented measure is that \"it would give women a better option than shacking up with some lowlife who beats her and steals her welfare money. The President would, of course, still be an absentee father, so the child would qualify for benefits. And if genetics plays true, the child will most likely have a better life than peers sired by criminals and deadbeats.\"\n\nIn related news, Harvard University announced a new course titled \"What What in the Butt: Anal Sex 101.\" A spokesperson for the University explained that \"the purpose of this course is to help students learn the facts about this exciting, yet often misunderstood form of pleasure. We take pride in staying ahead of the curve by offering to teach skills that less enlightened institutions shy away from out of fear of criticism.\"\n\nElected Black Republicans Called \"Traitors to Their Race\"\n\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) neglected to include Rep. Mia Love (R-Utah) and Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) n its post-election congratulations to African-Americans who won their races.\n\nCornell William Brooks, President and CEO of the NAACP, characterized the election of the Black conservatives as \"more of a setback than an advancement for people of color. These two have bought the right wing propaganda that individual achievement, hard work, and honesty are the way a person gets ahead in this world. Unfortunately, every individually successful Black person dilutes our case for slavery reparations.\"\n\nBrooks predicted that Love and Scott \"will join their white oppressors in voting against increases in welfare benefits, against racial set-asides, against reparations, and for the kind of strict law enforcement that has disproportionately sent so many of our brothers to prison. They are traitors to their race.\"\n\nRep. Love, who grew up in humble circumstances, cited her father's advice \"to never take a hand-out and never be a burden to society as my guiding light in social, economic, and political philosophy.\" This is a view that Brooks contends \"puts her diametrically at odds with the vast majority of African Americans.\"\n\nSen. Scott, meanwhile was given an \"F\" by the NAACP for vowing to \"free Black Americans from the trap of dependency that the Democratic Party has lured so many into. The only secure path to a successful life is through personal effort. I will be working toward removing the barriers to this effort erected by Democrats.\"\n\n",

Now his wife is sick and tired of him drinking during the week and has made it very clear he's screwed if she catches him doing it again. But tonight he's good. He told her that he would be working late, and he knows that she goes to bed early and is a heavy sleeper. \n\n\nSo he enjoys his night, but finally the night comes to an end, and it's time for him to go home. He makes sure to close his tab, checks to ensure he has his id and wallet - he does. Knowing that all of his bases are covered he goes to get up to leave and falls flat on his face. \n\n\nHe's a little drunk, so not entirely surprised. So he tries to get up and walk with the same results - bam, flat on his face. Now he's lying on the floor thinking, \"Shit. I can't call my wife, she will have my ass if she found out I was lying about working so I could go drink tonight.\"\n\n\nBut he's a determined man. He decides if he can't walk, then damnit, he'll fucking crawl. And crawl he does. He crawls the full mile from the bar to his house. By some miracle, he is able to unlock his door and lock it again once he's inside. And by an even bigger miracle, he's able to crawl his way into his bedroom and into bed without waking his wife. The man goes to bed smugly thinking how goddamn smooth he is.\n\n\nThe next morning, he wakes up with his wife standing over him glaring at him with the fury of a thousand hells.\n\n\n\"So... you went to the bar last night, eh?\" The wife angrily asks.\n\n\n\"What are you talking about, I was working?\" The man replies. In his mind, he's going back over his night. He is positive he covered all of his bases. There's no way his wife could have known.\n\n\n\"Don't lie to me; I know the truth.\" The wife snaps back.\n\n\n\"How?\" The man asks, generally stumped as to how she could possibly know.\n\n\n\"The bartender called... you left your wheelchair at the bar!\"",

Where upon, Ralph removed his dentures and \u201cbit\u201d his good eye.\n\nThe stunned auditor realized he had just wagered and lost three grand with Ralph\u2019s attorney as a witness, and he began to get a little nervous.\n\n\u201cWant to go for double or nothing?\u201d Ralph asked. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.\u201d\n\nThe auditor, twice burned, was really cautious now, but he looked carefully at the situation and decided that there was no way this guy could manage a stunt like that, so he agreed to the wager.\n\nRalph stood beside the desk and unzipped his pants, but although he strained mightily, he just couldn\u2019t make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side of the desk, which meant he pretty much urinated all over the IRS official\u2019s desk. The auditor leaped with joy, realizing that he had just turned a major loss into a huge win.\n\nMeanwhile, Ralph\u2019s attorney moaned and put his head between his hands.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d the auditor asked.\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d answered the attorney. \u201cThis morning, when Ralph told me he\u2019d been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over an IRS official\u2019s desk and that you\u2019d be real happy about it.\u201d",

He goes up to them and asks what\u2019s got them down. As it turns out, the three of them have all just been kicked out by their wives, who were unable to put up with their terrible worst traits. The bartender says to them: \n\n\u201cAnything that someone else sees as a bad trait can be spun around. Tell me your bad traits and I promise you I can show you a way that they help you in some way or even make you a better person.\u201d \n\nTwo of the men grudgingly agree, but the third is insistent. \n\n\u201cI promise you,\u201d he says, \u201cThere\u2019s no way to spin mine around.\u201d \n\nBut the bartender is insistent. \n\nThe first man offers up. \u201cMy wife kicked me out because she couldn\u2019t stand how lazy I was. Hard to see how you can spin that around.\u201d \n\nThe bartender immediately replies, \u201cThat\u2019s easy. Lazy people are great at finding ways to save themselves from wasting any unnecessary time or effort. Laziness can be a great motivator\u201d. \n\nThe second man pipes up \u201cWell my wife booted me because she couldn\u2019t stand my constant cynicism\u201d. The bartender quickly rebukes, \u201cAlways looking for and expecting the worst means that you can easily identify the worst possible outcome of situations in advance. That means you\u2019re more prepared to face the worst and you can plan ahead in case of the worst case scenario.\u201d \n\nAfter two solid responses the third man is impressed, but still adamant that the bartender won\u2019t be able to spin his huge flaw. The bartender remains insists that he can do it, though. \n\n\u201cFine.\u201d Says the third man. \u201cI\u2019m a pedophile.\"\n\n...\n\nThe bartender is visibly taken aback. \n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Says the third man. \u201cNo way to spin that\u201d. \n\n...\n\n\u201cWell\u201d, says the bartender after a pause, \u201cI bet that means you drive slowly through school zones!\u201d",

So I tear apart the apartment trying to find him. I look under the bed, in the closet, under the couch...nothing. Then, I look out on to the balcony and what do I see? Fucking fingertips hanging over the side! So I run out and start stomping on the bastard's fingers and he's screaming 'Wait! Stop!' but finally he falls! I look down and what do you know? He fell into the fucking bushes and starts getting up! So I run into the kitchen, rip the refrigerator out of the wall, and push it over the balcony right onto the mother fucker! But...I guess it was too much for me and I had a heart attack and died.\"\n\nSt Peter says \"Alright, go on in\".\n\nNext guy comes and St. Peter asks him how he died.\n\n\"Well, you'll never believe this. So, I'm working out really hard on my treadmill in my apartment and...I don't know, I guess I slipped because all of a sudden I'm rolling over backwards, right off my balcony.  I start falling and flailing but finally manage to grab onto another balcony. Then, out of nowhere, some psycho comes out and starts stomping on my fucking fingertips, screaming at me! I tried to get him to stop, but he just kept going and I fell. So I hit the ground but manage to land in some bushes and think 'Oh thank God, I'm okay!'. But then I look up and see the psycho pushing a damn refrigerator on top of me!

He looks up and makes eye contact with the monk, almost as if to say \"hey... i've got your carrots\". He then quickly turns and starts to break for the fence, which is now a considerable distance away as the garden doesn't start until a few hundred feet into the fence line. While the monk is a man of peace, he is not going to let some thief just waltz in and start stealing his carrots. These are, after all, the best carrots in the world. So the monk starts to give chase, but only 200 feet into the chase the monk is out of breath. The monk cannot run. \n\nSo the monk starts getting in shape, practicing his 400 meter dash. Hour after hour, day after day, week after week. And he becomes so good, that he becomes the MONK CHAMPION that year in sprinting. \n\nThe next day, he is in his garden, caring for his carrots, and a thief jumps over the same spot in the fence, runs to the same patch of carrots, and again takes 2 carrots. Only 2. \"This must be the same thief\" thinks the monk (as all the mannerisms are exact matches). \"He's not getting my carrots this time\" - the monk well knowing he is the monk champion in sprinting. So the thief turns to make a break for the fence, but the monk gives steady chase. He is not far behind when the thief gets to the fence, and he simply leaps over. The monk is stuck. He can't jump. \n\nSo the monk starts practicing hurdles.. hour after hour, day after day, weak after week. He becomes so good at hurdling that he becomes the monk champion that year in hurdles. \n\nThe next day he is in his garden, caring for his carrots, when of course, the same thief jumps over the fence, and takes TWO CARROTS. He again looks the monk in the eyes, almost as to say \"I will steal your carrots forever monk\". So the monk gives chase. He is gaining pretty well on the thief.. I mean.. he was monk champion earlier that year in sprinting. As they get to the fence the thief jumps over, and looks behind him with a smirk. But to his surprise, the monk hurdles over the fence with the greatest of ease. The monk is really gaining on the thief now. They run through the forest, the monk so ready to finally catch his thief, and put his questions to bed. Now just 20 or 30 feet behind the monk, they come to the lake behind the monks house. Monk can't swim. \n\nSo the monk starts taking swimming lessons, hour after hour, day after day, week after week, and he actually becomes the MONK CHAMPION that year in Monk swimming. \n\nSo the next day he is in his garden, caring for his carrots, when the SAME THIEF jumps over the fence and takes TWO CARROTS. They exchange eye contact and the chase begins. They run, they jump, they run, and then come to the lake. The thief jumps in and starts swimming away, but this time... well THIS TIME the monk is RIGHT BEHIND the thief. The thief is practicing breast stroke, while the monk utilizes dolphin swim. They make their way out of the lake, the monk now just steps behind the thief as they come to the mountain. MONK CAN'T MOUNTAIN CLIMB. \n\nSo the monk starts practicing mountain climibing. Hour after hour, day after day, week after week, and you know what. He becomes MONK CHAMPION that year in mountain climbing!!! \n\nSo the next day the monk is in his garden, caring for his carrots, when as expected, the same thief jumps over the fence, steals two carrots. Always two. It is clear now to the monk that, the thief could hold more carrots, and he's obviously physically fit.. why not take more? Two carrots alone cannot feed a family, or generate significant profit. It is this question most which bothers the monk. Why always two? \n\nEager to have his question answer the chase ensues, and they run, and they jump, and they swim, and they run some more to the base of the mountain, the monk now just steps behind the thief. As the thief makes his way up the mountain, he pretentiously looks behind him with a smirk, only to realize the monk is now an arms reach behind him! As they reach the summit, the monk FINALLY GRABS THE THIEF. Ready for some answers he flips the thief around. And as he does the thief judo chops the monk. MONK DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO FIGHT!? \n\nSo the monk starts practicing karate, hour after hour, day after day, week after week. And guess what. He becomes MONK CHAMPION that year in karate?!?! Simply amazing, all that this monk has accomplished.\n\nSo the next day, the monk is in his garden, caring for his carrots, and the same thief jumps over the fence, as always, takes two carrots, as always, and begins to break for the fence. The chase is on, and the monk is ready for answers. They run, they jump, they swim, they run some more, they mountain climb, and at the summit, the monk again GRABS the thief and flips him around! The thief, in a display of desperation, DOUBLE JUDO CHOPS the monk, but the monk, crafty now in karate, blocks both chops and swiftly leg sweeps the thief to the ground. \n\nIt is done. The thief is on the ground, the monk standing over him breathing heavy, comes down to one knee, and grabs the thief by the shirt, and pulls his back off the mountain so that their eyebrow lines meet, in a stare which can be compared to that of Arnold himself. The monk says to the thief \"I don't care who you are... I don't care where you are from... just tell me why. Why always two carrots!? What are you doing, that you always need... TWO... CARROTS?!?\". \n\nThe thief now realizing his days of carrot thievery are over, complies with the monks wishes. He says to the monk \"ok. I will tell you. But. This is so embarrassing. My actions with these carrots so unthinkable. The deeds so unimaginable... you have to promise never to tell anyone!\" \n\nAnd the monk never did.",

Otetiani, a boy whale, and Orenda, a girl whale.  \n\nAs they swam along they saw in the distance a whaling ship.  Upon seeing the ship Orenda became very nervous knowing that the ship meant death for her and Otetiani if they did not sound (dive deep) and swim away as fast as they could.  Orenda spoke to Otetiani, \"Otetiani! We must leave here, sound deep and swim away, lest these men come and take our lives for oil!.\"  To relieve Orenda's fears Otetiani began to speak, explaining a strategy he had come up with to deal with the whale boats.  It would allow the whales to again be the masters of the sea.  \"Our size and mobility are our greatest assets.\" Otetiani said.  \"We can take great breaths, then exhale as we swim underneath the whaleboats.  It will cause a great turbulence in the water, sinking the whaleboats and leaving the hunters individually adrift in the sea; they will no longer be a threat.\"\n\nOrenda, being a clever whale herself realized that this was no more than an adaptation of their \"bubble net\" feeding strategies.  \"Otetiani, surely you are wise, and with our combined efforts we shall surely prevail.\" so they agreed to defend themselves from the whalers in this fashion.  Taking great lungfuls of air they stealthily swam underneath the whaleboats and began to exhale.  \n\nThe whalers were confounded as the boats sank swiftly into the roiling sea.  Giddy with the success of the strategy Otetiani spoke to Orenda saying, \"Orenda! Quickly! Let us now devour the hunters as they founder in the sea.  They are helpless and we can destroy them so they can never hunt our kind again!\"\n\nDistressed with the change in Otetiani's plan Orenda quickly replied, \"Otetiani this is not how we should behave! I agreed to the blowjob but I am not swallowing seamen!\"",

As soon as a human publishes a book that mentions your accomplishments together, you can come back to heaven.  And you know what, take Satan with you.  He's always sowing discord among you, so he's part of the deal too.\"\n\nJacob, Jonah, and John are a little ticked off and eager to get back into Heaven ASAP.  Satan is on board, too, because he wants to get back to tempting souls into eternal damnation.  They decide to fulfill God's task in the most smart-ass way possible, by getting into the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\nJonah says, \"I spent three days and three nights in the belly of a fish, so surely I can break the record for holding my breath underwater.\"\n\nJohn says, \"I was plunged into boiling oil in Rome and suffered not; surely in this unholy age no man can match me.\"\n\nJacob says, \"I wrestled with God for an entire night; surely I can break a mortal record for strength and endurance.\"\n\nSatan says, \"I have sole authority and responsibility for dashing people's hopes of salvation and tricking them into everlasting torment, so surely I'm the biggest asshole in the world.\"\n\nThey agree that their plan is foolproof, so they each make an appointment at Guinness headquarters.  The next morning they drive together, wish each other luck, and go to their respective appointments.  Twelve hours later, they meet back in the lobby.  \n\nJonah says, \"I made it into the book!  A Danish guy held his breath for twenty-two minutes, so I held mine for twenty-three, and I spent the rest of the day signing autographs for kids who were here to stack cups and recite pi and stuff like that.\"  Jacob and John give him their congratulations, but Satan just rolls his eyes.\n\nJohn says, \"It took plenty of convincing, but they let me jump into boiling oil and awarded me a record for human heat tolerance!  Then I took a long hot shower and explained all the symbolism in Revelations to some guys who turned out to be huge fans.\"  Jacob and Jonah give him a give five and a pat on the back, but Satan snorts in irritation.\n\nJacob says, \"I'm surprised, the world record for pushups was pretty tough!  Still, it only took me ten hours to beat the 24-hour record.  The rest of the time they had me taking pictures and filling out paperwork.\"  Jonah and John congratulate him, but now Satan is literally hopping mad.\n\n\"So... Satan?

When they reach the ranger station, the rangers tell them that the mountain has had a serious bear problem lately.  \n\nThe rangers say that two bears, a male and a female, have been mauling hikers for the past few weeks, and that the men should come back another time.  After some discussion, the hikers decide that they came all this way to get up the mountain, and they were going to go, bears or no bears.  The rangers decide to let them, but ask the hikers to radio in every six hours so they know they are safe.  They take a radio, and off they go.\n\nAfter six hours, the rangers get a call in from the Russian saying that everything was fine, and that they were making good progress.  \n\nSix hours later, another call comes in, this time it's the Czechoslovakian.  He tells the rangers that they decided to make camp early to enjoy the view, but that everything was fine.  \n\nSix more hours later, nothing.  The rangers figure that they must be fast asleep, tired from the long day, and decided to wait until the next call-in time before getting worried.  \n\nWell, the next time rolls by, and no call. The rangers decide that something must have happened to the hikers, and send some men to find them.  Using the hikers last call in time, the rangers get a general idea of where they could be, and begin the search.\n\nAfter a while, the rangers spot some movement on a nearby hill, and whip out their binoculars to get a better look.  One ranger spots a female bear surrounded by what seemed to be scraps of clothing and gear.  She was chewing on a tattered backpack that had a Russian flag on the side.  \n\nAfter a long sigh, the ranger puts down his binoculars, looks at his partner, and says \"You know what that means, don't you?\" \n\n\"No, what?\" \n\n\"That means the Czech's in the male.\"\n",

Luckily, Ving let me copy off of him on one condition, I take him to get his name changed after school. The guy absolutely despises his name, he thinks it sounds too stereotypical and racist for an Asian person. On the drive over, we talk about some new names he might want to have. He wants to share one with a movie star, maybe Arnold, maybe Sylvester, but we decide on Lee, after Bruce Lee, to keep with his roots a little bit. We get to town hall, but his sister is already there. She goes off on a rant about how his name has been passed down through generations in their family, but he doesn't care and just walks by her. The woman at the desk gives him the form to do the deed, but as he's finishing up he just breaks down. Apparently the tradition stuff runs deep with him and he just couldn't bring himself to do it. The receptionist tells him there's a fine to cancel the request, but he doesn't have any money so his sister starts digging in her purse to find some cash. Suddenly, an older Asian man bursts into the building. Obviously their father, he embraces his son, the two of them are in tears. The man says, \"Don't stop, be Lee, Ving.

After many years of wandering, he finally arrived in a small village in the middle of nowhere. The people there believed in the same religion as he did, but they had no church; they had to go to the nearest one which was in a small town 25 km's from there. The priest took the initiative, asked the Church for support, and with the help of the local men they built their own temple. From there on, he was celebrating the Sunday masses, joining together men and women in Holy Matrimony, and saying prayers at the funerals.\n\nMany years passed by like that.\n\nAt the end of an ordinary mass, in early spring, on a chilly Sunday morning he was just guiding the people out of the church, was about to close the gates when an unknown man stepped into the churchyard.\n\nWith his dirty and torn clothes, he stood before the priest and said:\n\n\\- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was a good man, and even though he thought the request was a bit strange, he went back to the rectory, took out a lemon, cut it in half, took it back to the man and gave it to him, who looked back to the priest with gratitude. However, the priest was curious. He asked:\n\n\\- Son, why do you need this half of a lemon? - with a fright on his face, and before the priest could have said a thing, he rushed out of the churchyard gate and took off.\n\nA week later, around the same time, when the priest was leaving the church, he found himself in front of the same man in the churchyard. The man said:\n\n\\- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was surprised by the appearance of the man and his strange request. Of course he was good, went back to the rectory, and brought the half lemon. Placed it in the stranger's hand and immediately he asked:\n\n\\- Here it is, my dear son, but please tell me why do you need this half a lemon? - the man was obviously frightened and immediately ran away but the priest was not sluggish either and ran after him. He wasn't in a very good condition, he has never run so much and so fast before so he was out of breath by the end of the village, almost fainted. He thought the strange man might appear again next week, and it would be nice if he could keep up with him, so he spent his week working on his cardio. It turned out to be a good idea, because as he thought, the stranger entered the churchyard on Sunday. The priest didn't even wait for the request, he was good, and brought the half lemon. He received these words from the man:\n\n\\- Thank you priest for being so good and giving me half a lemon.\n\n\\- Don't mention it son, -said the priest- but please tell me, what do you need it for?! - by the time he finished his sentence the man was already running, but the priest was close behind. They were running for a while and the priest was starting to feel exhausted when they arrived at a wide and swift river. The stranger without thinking threw himself into the river and swam across the river and disappeared on the other side. The priest didn't follow because he couldn't swim. He was annoyed when he got home. He spent the next week learning to swim at the swimming pool in the small town 25 km's away. He was anxiously waiting for the next Sunday; now he was sure that the weird fellow would visit again. On Sunday, as he was closing the church, the gate creaked, and entered the man:\n\n\\- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was good, went back, put on his swimming trunks, his running shoes, grabbed half of the lemon and took it to the stranger:\n\n\\- Here it is, my son, but please tell me already, why do you need it? - the guy was terrified, rushed out the gate with the priest following. Reached the river, swam across, the priest right behind him. He kept running on the other side of the river and the priest was still on his tail. They kept running until they got to a tall tree on the verge of a deep ravine. The man climbed the tree with the agility of a cat, the priest not knowing how to climb a tree, stood on the ground. He was cursing everything as he walked back home. The following week the villagers watched as the priest in the garden of the church climbs trees, jumping back and forth, and generally behaving very strangely. The priest didn't care, he was exercising obsessively, preparing himself for the meeting. On Sunday before the mass, he put on his trunks and running shoes under his cassock. In fact, he was good and put half a lemon in his pocket in advance. The mass finished much earlier than usually, and he emptied the church as soon as possible so he could warm up. In the same exact time the mass should have ended, the strange man entered the churchyard.\n\n\\- Priest, please be good... - the priest was already handing him half of a lemon, and asked:\n\n\\- Son, why do you need it for God's sake? - the man ran away terrified, the priest followed him. They ran to the river, swam across, ran to the tree, climbed up. The priest almost catched the stranger when he grabbed a vine and swung to the other side of the ravine. The priest was about to have a stroke, but then he saw another vine. Whoop, he grabbed it and swung across. There, however, he encountered an unexpected obstacle: it was a plane graveyard and the man closed himself in one of the wreckages. The priest was raging as he walked around the wreckage several times, but he found no entrance except for the sealed door on the side of the plane; he had to open it somehow. He was furious but he went home. He spent every day at the village's locksmith and learned every possible way of opening a lock. On Sunday he held the mass in his swimming trunks, running shoes, on his back in a waterproof backpack was a crowbar, a cutting torch, a wrench and a drill, then he stood in front of the church and waited for the man. He was there on time.\n\n\\- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon!\n\n\\- There you go, son - handing him the lemon, because he was good, but in the same time he grabbed the stranger's arm, pulled him close, and with obsession in his eyes, asked:\n\n\\- But what do you need it for?! - panic came over the man as he made his escape from the priest's hands and ran away, but the priest was very close behind. Racing to the river they quickly got across, running up the tree almost breaking their necks, one after the other swung across the ravine, the man barely managed to close the door of the wreckege in the priest's face. Little did he know that the priest would not stop there, because he grabbed his backpack and started working on the lock with his tools. In less than an hour the heavy door creaked open. Inside, the stranger was shivering in horror, he was afraid of the priest's fierce and triumphant look. The priest slowly strode up to the man, crouched down, and very quietly, with a friendly smile on his face, gently asked:\n\n\\- Son. You have been asking for half a lemon for the last few weeks. I'm very happy to give it to you, even in the future, I am only asking in return that you tell me: why do you need it?\n\n\\- All right, priest ... - came the answer in a trembling tone - I will answer your question, but please, be good, and do not tell anyone.\n\nThe priest was good, and never told anyone.",

The deeply religious couple produced six children: Holie Schitt, Giva Schitt, Fulla Schitt, Bull Schitt, and the twins Deep Schitt and Dip Schitt.\n\nAgainst her parents' objections, Deep Schitt married Dumb Schitt, a high school dropout. After being married 15 years, Jack and Noe Schitt divorced. Noe Schitt later married Ted Sherlock, and because her kids were living with them, she wanted to keep her previous name. She was then known as Noe Schitt-Sherlock.\n\nMeanwhile, Dip Schitt married Loda Schitt, and they produced a son with a rather nervous disposition named Chicken Schitt. Two of the other six children, Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt, were inseparable throughout childhood and subsequently married the Happens brothers in a dual ceremony. The wedding announcement in the newspaper announced the Schitt-Happens nuptials. The Schitt-Happens children were Dawg, Byrd, and Horse.\n\nBull Schitt, the prodigal son, left home to tour the world. He recently returned from Italy with his new Italian bride, Pisa Schitt.\n\nNow when someone says, 'You don't know Jack Schitt,' you can correct them.\n\nSincerely,\nCrock O. Schitt ",

This man quickly became known all over town as the best butcher around. He eventually was getting so much business that he had to expand his store. Delighted, the butcher purchased a larger location with more display cabinets, larger kitchen space, and a much more spacious refrigerator with room to have many shelves. \n\nHis business only kept growing from here. People were coming from all over the state and the country to visit him and try some of his delicious meat. Soon, he was able to purchase exotic meat from all over the world. People would come in and eat meat from an animal that they had never heard of. The butcher shop grew ever more popular. \n\nThe butcher was of course very proud of all he had accomplished. He could see all of his hard work paying off. He was especially proud of these unique meats that he was able to purchase. To ensure that these meats were as fresh as possible, he would put them high up on the shelves in his refrigerator. \n\nOne day, he received a letter in the mail. It was an invitation to the largest butcher's contest in the world. The butcher was very excited, but was worried when he saw the price to enter the contest: all contestants would have to prepare their very best and most exotic meat, but if you lost, you must give up all the meat in your shop. \n\nConflicted, the butcher began walking around his shop. He looked at the display cabinets that he had worked for years to earn, he looked at his kitchen with all sorts of meat processing equipment, and finally, he went into his refrigeration room. He looked around at all he had worked so hard to earn. There were thousands of dollars of meat in the room. He looked up to the shelves containing the meat that he would use in the competition. After much personal conflict, he walked to the shelves underneath. He looked down at the invitation. He would have to give up everything he had worked for if he lost.\n\nBut the butcher had faith in his abilities. People had always told him that his meat was the best they had ever had. He looked up at these exotic meats. He had made up his mind. \n\nHe reached out his arm to grab a slab of meat he had been saving for something special. With arm stretched out, he suddenly paused. He glanced up at the meat, feeling like it was a million miles away. Suddenly, he dropped his arm and stormed out of the refrigerator, shouting, \"I can't do it! The steaks are too high!\"",

        "body": "Warning: very very very long\nThis is a shaggy dog story.\n\n\nA man is on holiday, driving a car down a road in the scenic British countryside. He passes many beautiful houses, fields full of a variety of animals, trees and flowers. Being the nice day that it is, the man decides to explore more of the countryside, and finds himself in a very strange place. There are no cars, and no sign of houses, or any people to say the least.\nSuddenly, the car begins to stutter and shake. The engine begins to hum in an odd way, as if struggling to drive the car forward. Then the engine stopped with the sound of a clank. The man, although confused and a bit shocked, calmy reaches for his phone to call his roadside rescue. Being a British countryside, the man discovers his phone to read \n\"No service...\"\n\nThe man, trying to be sensible decides to walk in hopes of finding someone who can help. \n\"A house\" he thinks to himself, \"I'll look for a house, someone can call a mechanic from their landline.\" The man begins to walk at a leisurely pace in hopes of finding a smidge of civilisation. He walks and walks for 20 minutes until he sees an old, but well looked-after house in the middle of nowhere. No chimney, no windows and no garden. The only thing the house had to show for itself was a dark brown wooden gate with fencing around the borders of the house.\n\"What an unusual house!\" The man said as he walked up to the big door. He knocks on the door and barely has any time to take his hand off the door before 3 monks, finely dressed greet him.\n\"Hello, Brother, how may we be of assistance to you?\" One of the monks asks before bowing politely and warmly.\n\"Hello, I'm having a bit of trouble, my car has broken down and I need to call a mechanic, do you have a telephone I could borrow?\" The man replies\n\"My most sincere apologies, Brother, but we believe that telephones are a distraction from God's beautiful world, and as such do not possess a telephone.\"\nThe man starts to look disheveled. He looks at his watch at notices it is nearly 7pm. It begins to rain lightly before progressing into heaving rain. The rumbling of thunder can be heard in the background.\n\"Brother, it is getting late, may I suggest that you proceed on your journey tomorrow, and stay in our humble abode. Brother Eric here will prepare you a bed if you would like?\" The main monk suggests.\nThe man looks back at the abismal weather behind him and agrees gratefully\n\"My greatest of thanks, I very much appreciate it.\" He says.\nOne monk replies \"We are all God's creatures, Brother and we are taught to love thy neighbour. We will take you to the nearest village at 8am tomorrow, and there you will find a mechanic for your car.\"\nThe man smiles and has a relaxing evening before retiring to a cosy, warm bed. He falls asleep to the sound of Soothing Chanting and choir music.\n\nLater that night, the man wakes up to the sound of faint sounds in the distance. Being the curious man that he is, the man decides to get dressed, leave his room, go down stairs to where the sounds are louder. These sounds are the most beautiful sounds the man has ever heard. The man, although not religious, feels impeccably close to God. His heart starts racing and dazzling feelings of tranquility flow through him. The man begins to cry at the level of serenity he feels. This sound is beyond the supernatural and he walks closer and closer, listening to the source of the sound. He eventually isolates the sound to a door in the basement. The man is now crying heavily as the beautiful sounds kiss his ears.\nThen all of a sudden the sounds stop. The man, feeling tired decides to go back to bed in hopes that the sounds to start again. Having waited for two hours, the man falls asleep.\nAt breakfast the man is eating with the other monks and all of a sudden, a monk enters the room and says: \"Brother, we are ready to lead you to the village where you will find a mechanic.\" The man finishes his breakfast and walks out of the house and is given many handshakes  as all the monks say their goodbyes.\n\nThe man and one of the monks walk for 40 minutes. They talk about the meaning of life, how the monks joined the brotherhood and why, until they cross a small village.\n\"You will find a mechanic in this building. I wish you well, Brother. You are most welcome to stay with us again. We don't get many visitors and greatly appreciate the company.\"\nAs the monk begins to turn away the man says \"Wait! I have to know about the sounds...I heard sounds. Beautiful sounds. Sounds I have never heard before. What were they? I must know\"\n\"Brother\" the monks replies, \"I cannot tell you, as you have to be a monk to know the source of the divine sounds.\"\nThe man, somewhat disappointed lets the monk on his way back and leads the mechanic by his pickup truck back to the broken down car at the side of the road.\n\"Oh, it was just the gasket there you see? It should be fine now\" the mechanic says. The engine starts perfectly.\nThe man drives home and tells his family of his travels, the monks and the divine sound like no other.\n\n2 years past since the day the man broke down and on his travels again, he decides to go back and greet the monks.\nAgain, he knocks on the door and is greeted by the welcoming and friendly monks who exclaim, \"Brother! It is so good to see you.\"\nThe monks and the man exchange complimentaries and the man is invited to stay again. Excited by the prospect of hearing the sound again, the man agrees happily.\nSure enough, later that night, the man woke to the beautiful sounds of 2 years ago. The man goes back to the place where the sound had come from last time, down the stairs in the basement.\nThis time the sounds did not stop. The man began to cry heavily at the warm feelings of serenity and peace. \n\nThe man HAS to know what is making these sounds. The man wants to know what, or who could be making such beautiful sounds. The man knocks on the large wooden door.\nAll of a sudden, the sounds stop and 5 monks appear from behind it.\n\"Brother? Can we assist you in any way?\" One monk says.\nThe man, still dazzled by the sounds still ringing sweetly in his ears stutters \"The-the s-s-sounds...w-what were those beautiful, beautiful sounds? I must know.\"\nThe monks then look at each other until one of them says \"Brother, my apologies but you must be a monk to know the source of the sounds, you must become one of--\"\n\"I'll do whatever it takes. Those are the most beautiful sounds I have ever heard in my life.\" The man interjects.\n\n\"It is very hard to become a monk, Brother, are you sure you want to become a monk?\"\n\"I am positive, I must know the source of the sounds.\"\n\"To become a monk you must do these two things: count how many blades of grass there are in the world, and count how many grains of sand there are in the world.\"\n\nThe man, determined accepts and travels the world in order to count the blades of grass in the world. \nHe starts in China and counts west all the way back to China. He writes it down. Then he counts every grain of sand in the world, starting in Cornwall and travelling East all the way back to Cornwall. He then writes the number down. It has taken many many years but the man, filling with excitement travels back to the house with no windows and no chimney, and tells the main monk he has competed his tasks.\n\"How many blades of grass are there?\"\nThe man takes a piece of paper out of his pocket and says \n\"377,832,728,191\"\n\"Correct, Brother, and how many grains of sand\"\n\"91,967,846,853,612\"\n\"Congratulations, Brother, you are now a monk.\"\n\"So can I know what the sounds are now?!\" The man exclaims in excitement.\n\"Meet us down at the door in the basement at midnight tonight\"\n\nThe man doesn't sleep that night. He stays awake in excitement knowing HE is finally going to know the source of those sounds, angelic and divine. The man is shaking in his new robes given to him by the monks. Then, the sounds starts, just as before, and the man begins to well up and cry in happiness. The clocks strikes 12. He remembers how the other monks had said \"you have to be a monk\" well now he WAS a monk, it was time for him to know the answer.\nThe man runs to the door he had once gone to and it greeted by three of the monks. \"Brother, in here you will discover the source of these beautiful sounds follow the door through.\"\n\nThe man opens the wooden door to reveal a bronze heavy door. The noises and sounds get slightly more audible and louder. \nThe man opens the bronze door to reveal a silver door. The man gasps in excitement and amazement.\nThe man opens the silver door to reveal golden door, that shows the man's face of shock.\nThe man opens the golden door to reveal a door made completely out of diamond. The man is amazed by brightness of the door and the sounds become even more prominent. The man cries heavily in happiness.\nThe man opens the diamond door to reveal a wooden door with a sign that reads \"the secret behind the sounds\".\nThe door creaks open as the man turns the old, worn handle.\nThere, he sees a room with a solid metal door. The man pushes on it with force and it slowly but surely opens wide to reveal a door, black as night. This door seems to be the source of the sounds.\n\nThe man takes a deep breath and says to himself \"This is it! I'm about to learn the secret of the beautiful, divine sounds. I have counted every blade of grass and every grain of sand to know the source of this sound. It was worth every year of my life, and here I am!\"\nThe man, nervous, opens the door slowly, and indeed this is the source of the sound. The sounds intensify and bring the man to his knees in joy and tranquility. The man weeps in joy as he sees the source of the sound.\nDo you know what the sound was? Do you really want to know? The man has seen the source of the sound men cannot even dream of.\nSo you want to know the source?\n\nI'm sorry, you have to be a monk to know the source.\n\n",

Once the battle ended and the enemy kingdom was left in ruins, and the battle not occupying his concentration, all the earthly desires came crashing down on Caesar. He had a magnificent banquet and fed his armies the same way. Then he had a good night sleep after what felt like eons.  \nAfter waking up the next day, he had the sudden desire to make love. He had heard rumors about the princess of the conquered kingdom being one of the most stunning creatures to walk among men. Caesar decided that since he had won over the kingdom already that it will be fitting for him to conquer the princess too. But the king had already sent the princess to his summer palace far away from the kingdom along with 10 of his most fiercest and trusted warriors for her protection. So Caesar set off with a small platoon of his fiercest warriors to find and claim the princess as his own.  \nThey travelled for a week, crossing dangerous jungles and raging rivers until they came to the summer palace. They waited until nightfall to mount a quite surprise attack. The guards were no match to the lethality of Caesar\u2019s warriors as they were easily overpowered. Finally, with his price so near, Caesar was not able to control himself. He ran inside the palace and burst into the princess' bedroom.  \nThere he finds this angel like princess sleeping fully naked in her bed. So breathtakingly beautiful she is, that, upon laying his eyes on her, Caesar instantly has an orgasm and screams OH GOD!  \nThe yell wakes up the princess and she immediately covers herself up. Seeing Caesar standing in the doorway, she commands \"What's going on here?\"  \nCaesar, his shoulders hung in shame, sheepishly declares  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n.  \nVENI, VIDI, VENI\n",

He went out and bought himself 20 female chickens and this huge rooster alpha male type hen. That cock was brilliant. Tall, lean, mean, fighting machine! Bob was so impressed by the cock that he named him \u2018Major\u2019 and made a special small house for him with air-conditioning for the summers and heating for the winters and carpets and cushions and whatnots! He even installed a small swinging door in Major\u2019s bachelor pad, leading into the female hens\u2019 area so that whenever the Major wants himself some Kentucky Vajajay he can just swing around and plants his seed while the hens were eating their seed..ha!\nBob thought, \u2018This is awesome, the Major will get poonany and I will get these awesome home grown eggs for my breakfast every day\u2019!\nAnyway, a few weeks go by with the Major causing havoc in the female population every day and night\u2026BUT\u2026there are no eggs!! Bob was flabbergasted. He was livid! He was angry and then he was sad. \u2018wtf!\u2019 he thought! \u2018My Major is sterile?!!\u2019 This is unbelievable! This huge alpha mean fighting cock can\u2019t be sterile!! I need to take him to some pet sex doctor or something!\nAnyway, he finds this specialist vet and the doc reassures him saying \u2018don\u2019t worry, it is not that uncommon as you may think it is, here\u2026take this bottle of pills and give the Major 1 pill every night before you go to sleep. Now remember, only 1 pill ok? Not more than that!\u2019\nSo Bob starts feeding those pills to the Major every night diligently but even after a couple of weeks there are no eggs!! So one night Bob gets mighty drunk and force feeds the entire contents of the bottle to the Major and goes to sleep.\nIn the middle of the night he is rudely woken up by this god awful animalistic howl and then sounds of carnage and slaughter of hens being done with extreme prejudice.  He rushes out to the hen house and there it is, all the hens are dead and dusted, blood everywhere, death by sodomy! There is a cock sized hole (glory hole?!) in one of the walls of the hen house and the Major is gone!!\nNow Bob is besides himself by now and just wants to find his Major and bring him home. He starts running in the general direction of where he thinks the Major went and comes across the neighbor\u2019s mean bob-cat. Dead with a stupid grin on its face! Assholes and elbows all over the place!\nHe curses the day he decided to feed Major all the pills (which was yesterday btw) and carries on searching for any signs of Major. He comes across a dead dog. Yep. Anally and actually dead. The Major had turned into this awesome lean mean fucking machine now and it was destroying any anus that came in its way with the ruthlessness that legends are made of! He was the Anus Annihilator which knew no distinctions as far as \u2018Anii\u2019 go. No race, no color, no breed and apparently no animal groups either. If the Major would ever fill out an application for a job, after writing his name in the name section, when it came to the part where it says \u2018Sex\u2019 Male\u2026Female, please tick one\u2026.The Major would have written \u2018I damn care\u2019!\nAnyway, Bob is crying like a child now and has come far from where he used to live in trying to find his Major. He comes across a forest and every animal he comes across has been butt-fucked till its eyes had popped and then cast aside like the dead animals they were. Deers, Pigs, Girrafes, Lions, you name it.

A Gargantuan of\u2026.well you get the idea!\nIts day time now and Bob comes across this large field and in the middle of the field he spots his Major, spent, lying down, dead. And he has this huge appendage larger than him also flaccid like its master now. The legend was no more. The place had gone eerily silent. Even the wind had died down. There were vultures circling overhead sensing a free lunch. Bob just broke down like a child and knelt by the dead Major and started crying. Keening, howling and beating himself on the head and chest and loudly cursing himself for being the reason the Major was dead. \nIt was right then that the Major without moving a muscle, raised just one silent eyelid, looked at Bob and quietly whispered, \u2018Shut the fuck up Bob\u2026. let the birds come down\u2019!!\n",

The old man pondered for a moment \u201cWell, how about the Blue Gorilla\u201d Asked the old man. \u201cBlue Gorilla?\u201d said the photographer, \u201cTheres no such thing as a Blue Gorilla\u201d. \u201cOh yes there is\u201d said the old man \u201cHe lives on a golden throne, in the biggest room, in a huge diamond palace on top the highest mountain in the most dangerous jungle in all the Peru\u201d the old man said \u201cAnd every photographer who has ever gone looking for him, has never returned\u201d. The photographer thinks for a moment, \u201cTheres is certainly no such thing as a Blue Gorilla, is there?\u201d he thought \u201cBut if there is, then I MUST be the first to photograph it!\u201d So that very night, he bought his plane tickets to peru, and by morning, he was off.\n\n He landed at the airport in peru the next morning, and hailed a taxi. once he got in he said to the old taxi driver, \u201cTake me to the Blue Gorilla\u201d \u201cThe Blue Gorilla!\u201d said the driver, \u201cI can\u2019t take you there, he\u2019ll rip off my arms and beat me with them! But i can take you to his jungle\u201d. so off they drove to the edge of the jungle. Once they got there the photographer was greeted by an old explorer, the photographer asked \u201cCan you take me to the Blue Gorilla\u201d \u201cThe Blue Gorilla!\u201d says the explorer \u201cI can\u2019t take you there, he\u2019ll rip off my legs and force me to run on his treadmill! But i can take you to the base of his mountain. so they walked to the base of the mountain. Once they got there, the photographer was greeted by an old sherpa, the photographer asked \u201cCan you take me to the Blue Gorilla\u201d \u201cThe Blue Gorilla!\u201d said the sherpa \u201cI can\u2019t take you to him, he\u2019ll rip off my head and make me play football with it, but I can take you up the mountain\u201d. so they climbed up the mountain. for three days they climbed up the mountain, then four, then five, the mountain got steeper 45, 60, 75, 90, 100 degree angles they climbed, until finally, they made it.\n\n It was just like the old man said, a giant palace made entirely of diamonds. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it!\u201d said the photographer, as he approached the giant diamond door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive golden door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive steel door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive iron door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive golden room, and at the end of the room was a massive copper door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive stone door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive wooden door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive bead curtain. he pushed the curtain aside, and behind the curtain, was a big banquet hall, and at the end of the banquet hall, sitting on a massive throne, was a BIG, HARRY, BLUE GORILLA. \n\n\u201cOh my god\u201d the photographer said \u201cHe\u2019s real, there really is a Blue Gorilla!\u201d he took out his camera and started snapping pictures, hundreds of pictures. finally he ran out of film, and started packing his camera away, then he had a thought. \u201cHey\u201d he said \u201cThat Blue Gorilla hasn't moved the entire time i was here, he could be FAKE for all I know, I need to touch him just to be sure\u201d. So he carefully walked up to the throne, leaned over to the Blue Gorilla, reached out his hand, and gently poked his face. \n\nThe Blue Gorilla sprang out of his throne and growled \u201cGRRRAWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla. The photographer screamed! \u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big wooden door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRRAWWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.\u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big stone door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRRAWWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.\u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big copper door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRRAWWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.\u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big iron door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRRAWWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.\u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big steel door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRRAWWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.\u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big golden door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRRAWWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.\u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big diamond door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRR AWWWW\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.\n\n \u201cNO\u201d, said the photographer, \u201ci\u2019d rather jump off the mountain than be killed by the Blue Gorilla!\u201d so he jumped off the mountain. as he fell he said, \u201cFinally, i\u2019m safe\u201d then he looked up \u201cGRRRR AWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla, as he plummeted after the photographer! the photographer landed safely in a haystack at the mountain\u2019s base, he ran and ran, the Blue Gorilla in hot pursuit. Then, in the distance, he saw the taxi driver at the edge of the jungle. \u201cHELP HELP!\u201d he said, \u201cTHE BLUE GORILLA IS CHASING ME\u201d he quickly jumped in the back of the taxi, and they sped off. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m finally safe\u201d. Then suddenly, he heard a tap on his window. \u201cGRRAWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla, running alongside the taxi. \u201cAAAHHH\u201d said the photographer, as he lept from the taxi, hitting the pavement hard. The photographer started running. He looked around quickly, the Blue Gorilla just seconds behind him. Then, he saw it, a plane! He ran towards the pilot and screamed \u201cHELP HELP, THE BLUE GORILLA IS CHASING ME\u201d. He lept into the plane, and they took off. \u201cPhew\u201d said the Photographer, \u201cI\u2019m finally safe\u201d. then suddenly, he heard a tap on his window. \u201cGRRRAWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla, as he hung from the wing. \u201cAAAHHH\u201d said the photographer, as he lept from the plane. as he fell he thought to himself, \u201cI\u2019m Finally safe, I\u2019d rather splatter than be killed by the Blue Gorilla\u201d. Then he looked up \u201cGRRRAWWWR\u201d said the blue gorilla, as he parachuted from the plane. The photographer landed in a lake, he crawled out of the water and lay on the shore. he heard the Blue Gorilla land safely a few meters from him. \n\n\u201cThats it\u201d he said \u201cI can\u2019t go on, i'd rather be killed by the Blue Gorilla than keep running like this\u201d. The photographer stood up, he closed his eyes and waited. \u201cGRRRAWWWR\u201d the Blue Gorilla shrieked, as he walked closer to the photographer.

He tells the Governor that he can help with the pigeon problem, but that he has stipulations. First, he will not ask for payment to help the great state that he loves, but he cannot be asked any questions, thus leading to the second stipulation. Any questions asked, are going to cost the Governor $1million.\nThe Governor, seeing no down side agrees to receive help form the man, who turns and walks to his car. He reaches in and pulls out a cage containing a single, blue pigeon. He opens the cage, the bird zips into the sky, does a couple of somersaults and takes off for the horizon...and all the pigeons followed it. \nThe sky opens up, beautiful sunlight shines through, the air quality improves, people can be heard cheering for miles away. The Governor, now in complete astonishment, watches as the blue pigeon returns, does another somersault and zips into the cage, which is closed by the owner who tips his hat, turns and walks away.\nThe Governor runs up behind him and says, \"Wait a minute, I need to ask you a question.\" The man replies, \"I told you, its going to cost you a million dollars a question.\" The Governor retorts, \"I'm the Governor of Arizona, I can handle it.\" The man asks \"What's your question?\"\nThe Governor asks \"You got any Blue Mexicans?\"\n\n\n(And with that I was officially declared a racist and booted off reddit forever.)",

Since their mother passed, John, the older brother had always been tasked to care for his younger brother, Nick, who happened to be mentally challenged.  John had helped Nick throughout their life, up to and including helping him to obtain his job at the factory, and here again he was helping to steer them through the unemployment application process.\n\n\nAt the office, however, John was perplexed to find that the liaison they were dealing with stated that each would have to go through an interview separated from one another.  \n\n\n\u201cWhy would you interview someone who is mentally challenged when I know more about what he does than he could ever explain?\u201d John inquired.  \u201cThis is standard procedure, we require individual interviews to determine complexity of the job being performed to adequately compensate for lost wages,\u201d the liaison retorts.  \n\n\nJohn walks Nick to the next room and they each await their interview, and after both are complete, they head home and begin a new job search.  \n\n\nLess than a week later, the first unemployment checks arrive, and Nick runs into the room to show John his enormous check.  John grabs the check out of his brother\u2019s hand and discovers that, sure enough, Nick\u2019s check is almost double the amount of his own. \u201cJohn, dis is so much money, I should stay on unemployment forever\u2026\u201d\n\n\nKnowing something must have been mixed up at the office, John heads over to the office to inquire with the assessor about the massive discrepancy in check amounts.  \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just curious how someone that is clearly unable to perform much above manual labor deserves so much more than a mid-level manager such as myself?\u201d John pleads.\n\n\nThe assessor proceeds to pull out the interview questionnaire filled out during his brother\u2019s interview.  \u201cWell, Nick explained during the interview that his position is a \u2018Diesel fitter\u2019, which when we compared to other mechanical professionals around town, especially those dealing with diesel-powered mechanical equipment, make roughly 150% of what you made on a yearly basis, hence the large discrepancy in your checks.\u201d\n\n\nJohn looks down and sighs.  \u201cI told you that I should be present for his interview, to avoid these types of mistakes.  Nick does no work with diesel equipment.  His job required taking the finished product off the assembly line, and slip them over his head.  If they fit and didn\u2019t rip, he would report that \u201cThese will fit her\u201d.\n\n",

And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.\n\nSo the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nAnd then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s just grab a beer. It\u2019s on me.\u201d\n\n[Courtesy of Simon Rich at the New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/11/18/guy-walks-into-a-bar?intcid=mod-most-popular)",

He called an assistant to tell him that he was sick and could not do church, packed the car up, and drove three hours to a golf course where no one would recognize him. Happily, he began to play the course.\nAn angel up above was watching the preacher and was quite perturbed. He went to God and said, \"Look at the preacher. He should be punished for what he is doing.\" \nGod nodded in agreement. The preacher teed up on the first hole. He swung at the ball, and it sailed effortlessly through the air and landed right in the cup 250 yards away. A picture-perfect hole-in-one. He was amazed and excited. \nThe angel was a little shocked. He turned to God andsaid, \"I beg your pardon, but I thought you were going to punish him.\" \nGod smiled. \"Think about it-who can he tell?\" ",

I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d \u201cOk.\u201d I nervously replied.

You agree and they both get in the back seat.\n\nOn the way there, they start undressing, until both are completely naked. Then, when you pull over to remonstrate, one of them climbs over into the front seat and starts crawling all over your lap, kissing you, touching you intimately and thrusting herself against you, while the other one steals your wallet!\n\nI had my wallet stolen on September 4th, 9th,10th, twice on the 15th, 17th, 20th, 24th and 29th. Also on October 1st, 4th, 6th, 9th and 10th and twice yesterday.So please warn all the older men you know to be on the lookout for this scam.\n\nThe best times seem to be just before lunch and about 4:30 in the afternoon.",

        "body": "Seniors, we love em and interact with them every day. With this in mind, lets take a look at the different types of seniors we meet. I've had the chance to speak with many types of seniors while working at a call center, here is a list of a few of em... \n\nSenior Lonely.   These seniors tend to call in around the holidays or weekends.  They talk to you as though you are a long lost friend not caring about the fact they don't know you. Be prepared to listen to all their senior related problems.\n\nSenior Heavy Breather.  These seniors, whether mean or nice tend to breathe really heavy on the phone. Most don\u2019t realize it and most won\u2019t do anything about it if you tell them.   Be prepared to put them on hold a lot to give your ears a break.\n\nSenior Fat Fingers.  These seniors tend to be angry at the world because it seems JUST too small to put their finger on. Be prepared for such things as \u201c this phone won\u2019t dial correctly\u201d Or \u201cthese buttons are too small!!\u201d    There really is no remedy for this other than suggesting a pencil and a magnifying glass. Most of these seniors suffer from arthritis \n\n\nSenior Grumpy:  These seniors call in grumpy and require much attention to detail to win them over. Mostly the issue they call about can be traced back to either not knowing how to, or forgetting what they did do \n\nSenior Happy:  These seniors are happy and can almost be counted on to tell you how wonderful life is.  Whether on vacation 50 times a year OR happy your service is cheep these seniors will add a smile to your face.   Be grateful for them!!\n\n\nSenior know it all: These seniors seem to know the answer before even giving you their account number.  These seniors will use antiquated or nonsense terms like \u2018 Digital analog\u201d to describe a cell phone they were shown just yesterday and how its better than the GSM phone you provide. They will also argue and demand 100% Proof that the .25 cent call made from their phone was indeed\u2026 Made from their phone.   Be happy they don\u2019t have your home address\n\nSenior Frisky: If you are a desperate agent you might wish these seniors were 25 years old, as they tend to want to flirt with you.  This stems in part from loneliness and well\u2026.. friskiness!!!. Most are harmless flirt types but just watch out for Senior Hard core!!\n\n\nSenior Hard Core:  These seniors Stress Everything they say. If they are angry, they stress that to you verbally. If they are flirting, they stress that as well. Everything to the extreme. They can turn a small thing into a huge problem.  Be happy for the times they stress how glad they are to have talked to you..\n\n\n\n\nSenior Stumper:  These seniors can vary from innocently making a point or backing a newer rep in the corner with an obscure point as to why they should get a credit or not pay their bill. Most can be disarmed by looking over their bill. The rest will continue to try to stump you on everything they ask with regards to their account.  The best defense is a good offense, just have a polite game plan. \n\n\n\nSenior PMS:  These seniors seem to almost always wake up on the wrong side of the couch or call in with a back ache from falling asleep in the lazy boy chair while watching A Lawrence Whelk special.  Most will be moody and short tempered and sound slightly slobbery when calling in.   Just be nice and straight to the point when helping them. \n\n\nSenior Quote: These seniors never say anything on their own, they must always quote others or obscure things that \u201csomeone else\u201d has told them. Most of the time it takes a little coxing to get their issue resolved.  Be sure to always give them correct information, least they quote you to the next rep. \n\nSenior Blame Others:  These seniors live by the motto \u201cWhy blame yourself if you can blame others\u201d. In dealing with these seniors, be sensitive and follow their lead. Just point out the mistakes (the other person made) and correct them but be sure to say\u201d the other person should have told you\u201d blah blah.   Be happy and positive with these seniors.\n\n\n\nSenior Long talker: These seniors will talk until out of breath and turning purple. They will carry a conversation that would normally take 5 minutes to a whole day if they could. You must be firm in dealing with these seniors. Be sure to assist them but be firm and to the point. You will need to keep them on track with issue at hand.  These seniors will gladly offer free lectures!!\n\nSenior inquisitor: These seniors are almost always on the high horse. Sitting high and talking down to you. These seniors think they have everything already worked out and are just testing you\u2026 Waiting for you to give the wrong answer.   Trick is to not be wrong.\n\n\n\nSenior Show off: These seniors love to remind younger people that although they are no longer young, they have a fancy home, yacht and a car you can only dream of. Most of these seniors are harmless unless they feel threatened that you may have more than them. \nI\u2019ve found the best way to diffuse these seniors is to go along and stoke their ego by saying \u201cGreat, You earned it\u201d\n\n\nSenior No Clue: These seniors really have no clue and are not afraid to admit it. Unlike other seniors who get embarrassed, these seniors openly admit they need help. Be happy when helping these seniors, they really need it.\n\nSenior Dispute: These seniors call just to argue. It does not even have to be about their service. They call just to pick a fight and dispute what ever you tell them.  \u201c the world if round\u201d  or \u201c The sky is blue\u201d no worries, they will dispute that as well.  These really is no pleasing them. Just concede the point and get off the phone asap.\n\n\nSenior Instigator: These seniors will start off the conversation peaceful enough just to hide their true intentions. They will usually insult your intelligence in order to start a problem.  Be it a true fact or some made up point, they will insult you to no end or until they are too tired to carry on.   Just take what they say with a grain of salt. \n\n\nSenior Whinny: These seniors almost always originate from New York or Kentucky. They will almost always start off the conversation whining about how bad the service is and how they have a bill due.  There is no advice I can give on these senior types as it tends to be location based. \n\nSenior I didn\u2019t do it: \u201cSorry I did not make that phone call, I don\u2019t know who did\u201d. These seniors will almost always deny their actions and will always demand proof. \nThe best way to deal with them is to call the number they said they did not dial and find out it was a call to their grandson\u2026\n\nSenior Super security: These seniors will always refuse to give the last 4 digits of their social security number. Even though they gave it to you to open an account. They will offer 101 excuses as to why they should not give it. Just politely remind them its needed to access their account.  It may take 30 minutes of reminding them\u2026  The longest recorded incident was almost 55 minutes!!!\n\nSenior wisdom: These seniors are always wonderful to assist. Towards the end of the call they will generally change the subject and offer some friendly advice, which for the most part you can use in your daily life.  Great people are always wonderful to talk to.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Techno Babble:  Cell phone becomes mobile communications device and Car charger becomes mobile power charging device for phones. Whether a different longer way of saying it or a senior made up word, these seniors pride them selves on knowing what\u2019s what. No sense in correcting them. If you do, they may become Senior Grumpy:\n\n\nSenior Political:  Whether getting angry with Roosevelt raising taxes or actually talking about politics in this decade, these seniors will never hesitate to share their political views with you. They take pride in themselves that  they have a captive audience to spout politics to. Just don\u2019t say anything, pretend it\u2019s a bad dream\u2026\n\n\nSenior Indirect: You hardly every get to talk to these seniors. They always have a son or daughter call in to take care of their business. When verifying the account you can always hear them in the background feeding needed information to their children to give to the rep.  In some rare cases the children may get upset or tired and ask to have you talk to their parent. When directly addressing Senior Indirect be sure to be supportive of their needs. Most of the time it\u2019s to cancel service. \n\n\nSenior Tough Talker:  If words were muscles, these seniors would be about 15 feet tall and weigh 900 pounds (full muscle) Usually when reps don\u2019t do something that Senior \nTough Talker wants they will threaten to call the Attorney general, alert the FBI and call Homeland security because of the 25 cent charge on their bill.  Don\u2019t feed into them or be scared, just patch them to a supervisor.  Supervisors make more money than you for a reason. \n\n\nSenior No Fair: Any time you have a special for new customers Senior No fair Will call in.  Be it a free phone case or 10 dollars less on your first bill, these seniors will call in and demand the same treatment and discount.  There is so few of these seniors its actually a good thing to just give it to them. \n\n\n\n Senior Quizzer:  (special Senior) This is a name of a senior I dealt with. She questioned every little aspect and was quite rude. She would quiz me on things I told her earlier in the conversation. Grab a note pad and take notes because Senior Quizzer is most likely doing the same. \n\n\nSenior Credit Fisher: These seniors are usually long time customers and only call in with minor problems. This is just the lure though; most of the time they play it out like a huge issue. \u201c My phone is broken\u201d (rep) \u201cPlease hold red button down\u201d (Senior)\u201d Oh it works now\u201d \u201c I need a credit for this though\u201d Senior Credit Fisher will try or say anything it takes to get credit on their bill.   If it\u2019s small just give it to them and save yourself a headache \n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Health Talker:  Whether it\u2019s the Boils on the bottom of their feet to the violent bowel movements they experience after eating out at a Mexican restaurant. These seniors will never hesitate to tell you about it.  Some senior heavy breathers have been known to talk about health issues when confronted about their heavy breathing. \n\n\n\nSenior Shaken voice: These seniors will talk in a very shaken voice. They may sound like Senior Helpless or Senior Indirect but these seniors don\u2019t mind being upfront and confronting their issues head on.  Nor are they helpless.  They are quite harmless to deal with. \n\n\n\nSenior Fixed Income:  These seniors live month to month and have no qualms about letting you know that. Typically they can just be good honest seniors looking to save money or a Senior Credit Fisher in disguise using \u201c fixed income \u201cas an excuse or ploy. \nMost of the time it\u2019s just an honest senior looking to save money. \n\n\n\nSenior Old Speaker:  These seniors will use old terms like That\u2019s \u201c Trick\u201d or \u201c don\u2019t be a square\u201d Another one is when they say they had to pay \u201c two bits\u201d  Old speakers tend to think about the past and don\u2019t care much for today\u2019s way of saying things. Old speakers are generally harmless, and don't mind taking the opportunity to tell you how much \u201c two bits \u201c is in todays speak.  Just assist them using normal talk. \n\n\nSenior Rusher: You would think the way these seniors rush you through the call they had a hot date at the senior center dance meet. No worries, these seniors are determined to stay active, healthy and young. Don\u2019t take it personal; they do that with everything in life. Just pace yourself and help them out. \n\n\nSenior Squabbles:  These seniors put up mild arguments about things ranging from their monthly statement to when they used the phone last. Senior Squabbles are typically weak willed and just simply like to argue in a mild manner.  Just roll with it\u2026\n\n\n\nSenior Life Story: These seniors tell some of their life stories. Whether it\u2019s something interesting or something along the lines of what they did to their Aunt Sally pet bullfrog back in 1934. You can always count on some interesting story that has nothing to do with why they called in.   Some of their stories are actually neat to hear\u2026\n\n\n \nSenior Freebie: These seniors are excellent at sniffing out any free offers they can come across. Almost all conversations will lead to getting something free. Unlike Senior Fixed Income & Senior Credit Fisher these seniors just want something free.  They can be rich or poor it does not matter.  Offer them a free pamphlet with our newest merchandise. \n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Fancy words: Senior fancy words likes to at least 2-3 old time words per conversation. They pride them selves on knowing such words and often enjoy telling you what that means.  Most of the time they give a slight pause to let the word soak in and see if you know what it means.   The best remedy for this is to have Google at hand. If your quick enough you can give a quick response with the meaning of the word. This usually throws Senior Fancy words for a loop and they will quickly end the conversation.\n\n\nSenior Braggart: Unlike other seniors who brag about very specific things, these seniors will brag about almost anything. Killed a stray rat with my walker to bragging about how they found a new way to deal with junk mail, these seniors will be sure to let you know!!!\n\n\n\n\nSenior No credit:  These seniors have spent their entire life using cash and have no built credit. Sadly when it comes time for a credit check they won\u2019t pass.  I always hated telling these seniors that I could not open an account\u2026\n\n\n\n\nSenior Whiz: These seniors first off know just about everything about their service. They know their mobile numbers, rate plans and billing cycle. They even know how to dial AAA using the quick dial. They usually call in to go over things they already know just to impress you on how great of a customer they are.  Chances  are Senior Whiz will remember who they dealt with last\u2026\n\n\nSenior Clarification:  These seniors require clarification on everything you tell them about their plan. They also tend to call in weekly or Bi Weekly for further clarifications on what they are signed up for, monthly cost etc.  These are our bread and butter customers who keep us busy!!!\n\n  \n\n\nSenior Check up: These seniors sort of display behaviors associated with Senior Indirect: and Senior Insecure: However they have no problem dealing directly with you. The main thing that sets these seniors apart from other seniors is they will always call back and ask that rep if the last rep did what they wanted. Most often confirming what the last rep did or said will end the call, however Senior Check Up can very quickly become a Senior Instigator if they feel in a rotten mood.  No advice for you on these seniors except make sure you notate the account and do exactly what you told them you would do for them.        \n\n\n\nSenior Feel Sorry for me: These seniors play the victim and put on a sad act. Their act is to make you think they need to cancel. Most of the time they will manipulate a conversation and try to make you feel like you are the one that  backed them into a corner to quit service. They give pauses hoping you will save them with phone credits or free stuff. These seniors usually call back and speak to another rep to restart service for a few months before repeating the Feel sorry for me cycle.  Really you can't help them as this may happen to 1 in every 50 seniors!!\n\n\n\nSenior Favorite Rep: These seniors feel as though they have built a reputation with a certain rep and thus by only speaking to that rep will in turn receive better service or special breaks ie:  credits, special rates etc.  Nothing short of a miracle will get Senior Favorite Rep to talk with a different rep.  I\u2019ve found it easier just to get them to whom they want to speak with\n\n\nSenior Rude Behavior:  These seniors typically display rude behavior that\u2019s not always directed at the rep. Be it a senior belch or a slow paced tinkle in the potty, these seniors are oblivious that you can hear what\u2019s going on in the background. Most seniors are nice to you but just display behaviors that are best left in private.   Don\u2019t tell them you can hear, they will get embarrassed \n\n\nSenior Ghost Caller: That\u2019s not a prank phone call, its just gramps talking about grandma to his best friend while his cell phone is in his back pocket!!! Seems all them calls he never makes are because he sits on his cell phone. Just note the account for the next rep and hang up\u2026 \n\n\n\n\nSenior Insecure: These seniors require special handling when working with them on their account.  They really don\u2019t want the service but they know that as soon as they drop it they will need it right away. They hang on by the thread and are never sure about what to do. Just take them by the hand and make them feel good about their service\n\nSenior Multiple Speak: These seniors have a million things racing thru their mind (which I suppose keeps them going) but its when they talk that you can quickly become confused. They tend to ask a question followed by another question followed by a statement followed by another question combined with a statement that often has nothing to do with why they called in the first place.   They may be a hassle for you but let them vent it all out than inform them you are not as fast as they are and will need to handle one issue at one time\n\n\n\nSenior New Age: These are people who have just reached the 65 mark and really are in touch with the goings of today\u2019s society. They may display any of the typical senior behaviors but are more confident when doing so (with the exception to senior indirect and other timid senior   behaviors) Just usher these new seniors in and be nice..\n\n\n\n\nSenior Denial:  If these seniors lost 1 year for every time they denied their age they would be about \u201350 years old.   They sometimes flex their voice to sound younger and hate giving their Date of Birth for credit checks and such.  NOTE: If a senior Denial gives the last 4 of the social but not the Date of birth you can be sure it\u2019s a Senior Denial and not a Senior Super Security!!   Just follow the rules for credit checks\u2026\n\n\n\nSenior My Way:  These seniors almost always try to buck the system using their own methods and reasoning. You are always expected to go along with their way of doing things.  Whether its them saying they paid ahead and expecting you to agree and confirm with them what they said is true.  When really they paid current and past due amount. \nJust keep repeating in your head\u2026 I\u2019m not going crazy, I\u2019m not going crazy\n\n\n\n\nSenior They Said: This is not to be confused with Senior Stumper or Senior Quote; these seniors have no qualms about making up a full fledge fib. Always quoting that imaginary person \u2018 they \u201c these seniors will say anything to prove to you that what                \u201c they\u201d told them is correct.  Just tell them that \u201cthey\u201d was wrong\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Drama:  Forget that grandma Lulu lost gramps to a 20-year-old women. Forget that during the senior dance fest grandma was dancing too close to the DJ!! . These seniors love to cause drama with every breath they take.  Typically these seniors are taking care of their grand children because their son or daughter decided it was too hard. These seniors are typically on a fixed income but always manage to get by. They may exhibit behaviors often associated with Senior Low Income or Senior My Way. \nThey will almost always tell you about the grandchildren\u2026\n\n\n\n\nSenior Smoker: Is that Grandpa or Grandma? I can\u2019t tell!!! Who knows because it\u2019s Senior Smoker!!  These seniors are always mellow unless they call before the morning cigarette and cup of coffee. It\u2019s best to get their name first!! Never assume it\u2019s a man or women\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Identifier: These seniors always get the first word in and always start out by identifying themselves. Rep: Thank you for calling consumer.. Senior Identifier: Hello this is John Smith I have an account with you and I am also a AAA member for 30 years. My address is\u2026 My home state is\u2026  Senior Identifier almost always never starts off with the correct information needed ie; Account number or 10-digit cell phone number.  Just allow them to babble and act as though it means something, than politely ask for the 10-digit cell or account number.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Distractions: Whether its the 24-hour Bingo channel blaring in the background or gramps playing with his false teeth   Senior Distractions will always have a distraction for you when calling in.  Just try to ignore the distractions and go about helping them. Senior Distractions can sometimes become angry and feel like you are ignoring them\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Heavy Thought: Forget asking questions, these seniors will ponder for minutes what you tell them. They will use their own logic and reasoning to decipher what you tell them.  After several minutes of thinking Senior Heavy Thought: will finally come up with a course of action or request they want you to consider / do for them.  Just grab a book while you wait...\n\n\n\n\nSenior One Liner:  These seniors (typically males) will always have that one line they want to say before the call ends. Most of the time its an opening or closing line. Sometimes it requires the conversation to be lead to a subject where the senior can pop off his or her one line.  Senior one liner will feel as though their call went sour if they are not allowed to pop off their one line.   Senior One Liners are easy to work with after they have said their one liner\u2026\n\n\n\nSenior call a lot:  These seniors call in a lot just for the sake of feeling busy and or important.  Not really having a good reason to call they often can be spotted checking their minutes or going over their rate plan. They typically call in 2-3 times a or1-2 times daily.. Senior Call a lot is easy to work with most of the time\u2026 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Vocabulary and phrases that will help you understand senior speak. \n\n\nMobile Communication Device:  This is senior techno babble for Cell Phone. \n\nLet me think about this: A senior\u2019s way of saying I don\u2019t get my social security until the 3rd of the month. \n\nI did not make that call: This is a senior\u2019s way of saying \u201cI don\u2019t remember making that call\u201d\n\n\nMy phone is not old, I\u2019ve only had it 5 Years: This is a seniors way of saying \u201c My phone should not warring down until its physically broken\u201d OR  \u201c I hate the thought of having to buy another phone\u201d\n\n\nThese buttons are too small: A Seniors way of saying, \u201cMy eye sight is poor\u201d OR \u201cI have big fingers and can\u2019t dial numbers correctly\u201d\n\n\n\nI did not use the service that month:  In Senior speak this means \u201cI should not have to pay since I did not use the phone\u201d \n\n\nI\u2019m a long time customer: This means \u201cI expect good service and any special discount you haves\u201d   \n\n\nMy phone is broken: This could mean anything from \u201c I don\u2019t know how to turn my phone on and am embarrassed to admit it\u201d OR\u201d I don\u2019t know how to call out but this is my indirect way of asking for help\u201d.\n\n\nI don\u2019t call my self: (when being asked for the 10-digit cell number) This is senior speak for \u201cI can\u2019t remember my cell number because I never use it\u201d\n\n\nThis instruction Book you sent is worthless:  \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about my cell phone and am hinting at needing help with my phone \u201c\n\n\nI\u2019ll get my grandkids to help me with this: In senior speak this means,  \u201c I am still not understanding you and need to see how to do this\u201d OR \u201c I am tired and want to get off the phone\u201d\nI need to return this phone: most commonly this is the senior way of saying \u201c I want to cancel service\u201d \n\n\n\nI need go over my bill: Another senior way of saying \u201c I don\u2019t understand why my bill is this much\u201d OR  \u201c There\u2019s numbers on here I don\u2019t remember calling but I am too embarrassed to admit I can\u2019t remember so I am going to deny I made these calls\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeniors are sure a mixed lot that requires special treatment, when dealing with seniors remember that they over all have a right to be respected and their issue handled. How you handle the issue depends on the senior type. With this senior spotting guide I hope you can spot the different seniors and know ahead of time how to handle them. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n",

The bear says, \"You have two options, you can be mauled to death or you can bend over and take it.\" Not wanting to die, the hunter bends over and takes it from the bear. The hunter decides to go back to camp to get a more powerful rifle to shoot the bear with. He returns to the woods, and after a while, he finds the bear, takes aim, and shoots. He sees the dirt behind the bear pop up and again goes to find the blood trail. He gets down only to find no blood trail and once again no bear. He feels a familiar tap on his shoulder. \"You know the two options,\" the bear said. Once again, not wanting to die, the hunter bends over and takes it from the bear. At this point the hunter is pissed, returns to camp, and gets his elephant gun. He returns to the woods, finds the bear, and takes aim. He sees the dirt pop up behind the bear and eagerly runs down to claim his prize, only to find yet again no blood trail and worse, no bear. Again the hunter feels a familiar tap on the shoulder. Slowly, he turns to find a grinning bear. The bear looked the hunter dead in the eye and with a smirk he says, \"you didn't down here to hunt, did you?\"",

The dermatologist had never seen any letter-shaped rashes like this before so her asks her about it. \n\nThe woman sheepishly replies, \"Oh doc...well, my boyfriend just got into Harvard Law School. It is a little weird, but he likes to wear his Harvard sweater when we have sex. I think I am allergic to the fabric.\". The dermatologist agrees that is probably the cause of the rash, gives her a cream, and sends her off.\n\nThe next day, the nurse lets another young woman into dermatologist's office who says she also has a rash. The dermatologist asks her to lift her blouse and sees a rash in the shape of a 'Y' on her chest. The doctor, following his usual list of questions, asks her if she had any contact with any materials she may have been allergic to. \n\nThe woman turns bright red and quietly says, \"Well, my boyfriend just got into Yale Business School last week and he has this Yale sweater he has been wearing when we have sex. I think I got this rash when it rubbed on my skin.\" The doctor agrees that this is probably the reason for her rash, gives the woman a cream, and sends her off.\n\nThe next day, the dermatologist sees yet another woman who says she has a rash. The doctor asks her to lift her t-shirt and finds a rash in the shape of an 'M' on her chest. The doctor cannot help himself and starts chuckling. \n\nThe woman, now a little irritated asks the dermatologist why he is laughing. The doctor confesses, \"This week I had two women come in with rashes on their chests. One in the shape of an 'H' and another in the shape of a 'Y'. Let me guess, your boyfriend got into Michigan for graduate school and he likes to wear his Michigan sweater when you two have sex.\" \n\nThe woman, now clearly flustered stutters, \"Well, uhh...\" But the doctor cannot stop himself from continuing. \n\n\"...and you must be allergic to the fabric in his sweater! Please, please, tell me if I am right! I must know.\"\n\nThe young woman takes a few breaths to calm down and then says, \"Um, well yes, you are right about one thing. I must be allergic to the fabric in the sweater.\" \n\nThe doctor leans back in his chair for a moment and thinks, *Imagine! Three in a week. How strange!*, but then remembers what the woman said and asks, \"But what am I wrong about?\"\n\n\"My girlfriend got into Wisconsin.\"\n",

Ivan was a huge mountain of a man, bigger than a full-grown Grizzly, more irritable than a nest of hornets, and with the pain tolerance of a drunken Scotsman. Ivan was known for 2 holds, the Half-Pretzel, which would instantly break one's back, and the Full-Pretzel, which would kill instantly.\n\nThe pre-show was over, and it was time for the main attraction. Ivan the terrible stepped into the middle of the circus tent, and the ringleader came out and said \"100 pounds to the man who can best Ivan the Terrible in the ring!\" The crowd murmured, but none stepped forward. \"200!\" The crowd murmured some more, until, at last, one man stepped forward. \"I'll do it!\" said the burly old Scotsman. \"Excellent!\" cried the ringleader as the man stepped into the ring with Ivan the Terrible.\n\nWithin a second of the bell ringing, the two were on each other. The Scotsman was giving Ivan a good fight, but none could best him. In another couple of seconds, the Scotsman was in the infamous Half-Pretzel. The crowd gasped, as they expected the match to end there. One rarely gets up from a Half-Pretzel. But Ivan would not pin him, nor let him tap out. The battle raged on, the Scotsman miraculously continuing the fight, even with a broken back. But soon Ivan had him in the dreaded Full-Pretzel.\n\nThen, at his darkest moment, the Scotsman shot up and pinned Ivan to the ground. The ringleader counted out \"1, 2, 3\" and that was it. The fight was over, Ivan was bested.\n\nThe ringleader ran over to the Scotsman and asked him, amazed, \"How did you do that?\" The Scotsman replied, \"Well, we were fighting and fighting, and then he had me in the Half-Pretzel, and I thought I was done for! But he wouldn't let me lose just yet, he kept playing with me, and then he had me in the Full-Pretzel, and I made my peace with God. But, when I opened my eyes, I saw a gigantic pair of testicles hanging in my face. So I reach up and I sink my teeth into 'em! It's amazing the rush of strength you get by biting your own testicles!\"\n\nThe man got his money.",

God thinks to himself, I have made this Mexican's life so unbearably awful, he surely cannot be happy. \n\nBut lo, the Mexican was happy.  After work he ate some chips and salsa and danced a happy little dance around a Sombrero, shaking maracas and singing \"La cu ca ra cha, la cu ca ra cha, na na na na na na na\" and so on.  \n\nThis angered God.  God tried so hard to make this man's life unbearably miserable and hard, the Mexican man must be uncommonly intelligent to be so happy despite his suffering.  God decides that he will thus remove half of this Mexican's brain, and see if he is still so happy.  So, POOF, half the Mexican's brain is gone.  \n\nGod gazes down again upon this Mexican.  He can't believe it - the Mexican is still dancing around the Sombrero, singing \"la cu ca ra cha, la cu ca ra cha, na na na na na na\"  This makes God even more wrathful, how can someone who suffers so much and now is half as smart, still be so happy?  Thus he decides - POOF- to remove half of the Mexican's remaining brain. \n\nGod peers down from heaven again, to see the Mexican man still singing and dancing around a Sombrero.  At this point, God became so filled with rage that in his wrath - POOF- removed ALL of the Mexican's brain.  Now, with no brain, will the Mexican still be happy and dancing? \n\nGod gazes down again and what does he see?  The Mexican man has put down the maracas and Sombrero, and is now dancing around a fire chanting an Indian war chant \"WA WA WA WA WA WA WA WA\"",

While walking past Buckingham Palace my wife states \"I wish we could go inside and meet the Queen\"\n\nI said \"Would you like to ?\"\n\n\"There is no way you know the Queen of England\"\n\n\"I do \" and with that I walked up to the Queens Guard and asked to see the Queen. He immediately stepped aside and we walked right up the the front door and were invited in for tea by the Queen. After visiting with the queen my wife said \"I cannot believe you knew the Queen but I am glad you did that was some good Tea\" \nAfter our tour of England we decided to take a trip to the Vatican and listen to the Pope speak. It was a dreadfully hot day and the Vatican was packed with people eager to hear the pope. That is when I told my wife \" It is too hot down here and it is impossible to hear or see. I think I will go up and see the pope and watch from up there\"\n\n\"There is no way you know the Pope, John. You go make a fool of yourself  but I will stay right here and you can come and find me when you are done.\" With that I walked away to find the pope. As I am standing up waving next to the pope as he starts his wonderful speech, A commotion happens in the crowd and I see an ambulance pull up and my wife taken out on a stretcher. I go down after thanking the Pope for his hospitality and see my wife. I asked what happened. She replied \" I could believe you knew the mayor. I was stunned that you knew the President, and in awe that you knew the Queen, but when the little boy next to me leaned over and asked \"Who is that in the funny hat standing next to John?\" I lost it.\"\n\n**Edit** Formatting\n",

I said to the frog, \"Wow that's amazing. You must be a lucky frog, eh?

I was befuddled and didn't know what to say. By the end of the day, I had played the best game of golf in my life and asked the frog, \"where to next?\"\n\nThe frog replies, \"RIBBIT Las Vegas\". So we went to Las Vegas and I said, \"Ok frog, now what?\" The frog says, \"RIBBIT roulette.\" Upon approaching the roulette table, I asked, \"what do you think I should bet?\" The frog replies, \"RIBBIT $3000, black 6.\" Now, this is a million-to-one shot to win, but after the golf game I figured what the heck. Boom! Tons of cash comes sliding back across the table. I took my winnings and bought the best room in the hotel. I sat the frog down and said, \"frog, I don't know how to repay you.

Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly, and they're always late. So, where are you staying in Rome?\"\n\n\"We'll be at the downtown International Marriott.\" \n\n\"That dump! That's the worst hotel in the city. The rooms are small, the service is surly and they're overpriced. So, whatcha doing when you get there?\" \n\n\"We're going to go to see the Vatican and we hope to see the Pope.\" \n\n\"That's rich,\" laughed the barber. \"You and a million other people trying to see him. You'll be at the back of St Peter's Square and from that distance he'll look the size of an ant. Boy, good luck on this lousy trip of yours. You're going to need it.\" \n\nA month later, the man again came in for his regular haircut. The barber asked him about his trip to Rome. \n\n\"It was wonderful,\" explained the man. \"Not only were we on time in one of American Airlines's brand new planes, but it was overbooked and they bumped us up to first class. The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a beautiful 28 year old stewardess who waited on me hand and foot. And the hotel was great! They'd just finished a $25 million remodeling job and now it's the finest hotel in the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us the presidential suite at no extra charge!\" \n\n\"Well,\" muttered the barber, \"I know you didn't get to see the Pope.\" \n\n\"Actually, we were quite lucky, for as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the pope likes to personally meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait, the pope would personally greet me. Sure enough, five minutes later the pope walked through the door and shook my hand! I knelt down as he spoke a few words to me.\" \n\n\"Really?\" asked the Barber. \"What'd he say?\" \n\nHe said, \"Where'd you get the shitty haircut?\"",

        "body": "Here's my embellished version of a joke I learned when I was a kid. I swear to god there's no loch ness monster.\n\n**Benny and the Urn**\n\nOnce upon a time a man named Benny was living in ancient Mesopotamia. A miner by trade, one day he discovered a secret cavern filled with jewels, gold, and piled high with priceless artifacts.\n\nThe floor was covered with golden jars, urns that were formed from solid gold. They were each the size of a man's heart, carved with runic symbols and the air around which shimmered and pulsed as if alive. But the real prize was atop the pile of loot, nestled in a case lined with red velvet; a golden oil lamp, etched with markings and symbols older than time. \n\nNo sooner did Benny take it into his hand than a swirling tornado erupted from its spout. The light from his single torch seemed to falter, then blazed anew as the tornado calmed. When the dust had cleared, a strange man stood before him, clothed in gold with his arms folded across his bronze chest. He spoke with a rumbling voice that could not be ignored.\n\n\"You have released me from my ten-thousand-year imprisonment, and in gratitude I will grant you a single wish. Choose wisely.\"\n\nBenny thought for a long while, and when he had weighed the options he asked for immortality, that single unobtainable goal that all men strive for.\n \n\"Everlasting life will I grant you,\" said the Genie, \"But on one condition. You must swear by the life you will owe me that you will never again shave the hair of your face or head, never for all eternity. Do this, and eternal life shall be yours. Do not, and your soul is forfeit, and you will join the many that failed and in turn have been imprisoned here.\" He gestures around at the urns that cover the floor of the cavern. The air around each shimmered and pulsed silently. \n\nOf course Benny agrees, and the Genie vanishes in a puff of gold dust, leaving all the wealth of the chamber behind for the taking. \n\nBenny rushes into the city and buys the land containing the cavern of riches and overnight becomes the most famous and wealthy man in the realm. He gives up mining and buys a fleet of trading ships, not only to grow his wealth but to spread the tale of Benny and the Lamp across the seas and to distant lands, the better to see his own self last through the ages. \n\nAs time passes, and his beard grows longer, he notices the passage of time more distinctly. His parents die, his brothers and sisters, all fabulously rich and comfortable, but their passing is no less sorrowful to him.\nWhen his wife and the last of his children are in their graves, he swears to continue his life for as long as the Genie's spell could prolong it, spreading his wealth amongst the people in honor of the family he'd outlived. And yet his solemn vow was tainted with sadness, because he knew no amount of good deeds could win back that which time had won from him.\n\nAnd yet his business prospers, sails turn to oars, oars to steam, and always the sun and stars march on in their ceaseless wandering. All passes in the blink of an eye to him, his experiences and memories dull as glass in the dark of night. He becomes a myth, a legend whose tales are told and songs are sung but who never truly existed, or certainly not in this age. Wealth has lost all meaning to him, success long achieved and forgotten. \nTired of civilization and wanting solitude, de returns to his cavern of riches, and thinks. He thinks of time passed and love lost, of the crashing sea and its inexorable destruction of earth. He sits alone, and he thinks... \n\nOne day his reverie is broken by a shaft of light cast down into his cave. The eons had reformed the entrance around him, sealing off the man and his thoughts in a silent black tomb. A head pokes through the hole in the ceiling, a mane of fiery red hair follows, a round laughing face stained with sweat and rock dust. It is the first person Benny has seen in unknown thousands of years, and, eyes watering, he lifts his arm to touch the face of god, as it were. He finds he cannot. His arm is frozen, encased in a fibrous tomb, as well as his legs and head. \n\nDuring his ages of inactivity, his arms and legs had withered from disuse but his beard grew on still. It grew and it grew, wrapping the man and then filling the cavern with its mass, until the weight of it pressed itself into stone. Benny was encased in a layer of rock of his own making, only a faint outline of a face in the rock wall to mark his existence.\n\nThe young treasure hunter drops lightly to the floor from a long rope, shouts up to her companions to come down. The first man down is bulky and graceless, encumbered by a bag of heavy equipment. The next man down is timid, inching slowly down the rope and pressing a sweaty finger to the bridge of his glasses every few seconds. The woman and the heavy man begin searching the cavern as the mousy man dusts off his vest and examines the stone floor of the cave. \"Interesting...\"\n\nHe draws a small leather pouch from his rucksack and produces a magnifying glass and set of tools. He kneels, examines the stone here, the stone there, and eventually finds a small protrusion in the center of the chamber. \n\n\"Kind of looks like a face\", he thinks as he chooses a small hammer and chisel from the pouch. He opens a notebook and notes the date and location.  He decides to chip it from the rock wall for a memento.\n\nA single tap with the tool just below the chin, and the stone chip flies through the air and suddenly the man too is flying, falling, through dust and air and... gold? The cavern swirls away, sucked down to a point far below, the light above dwindles until it's no more than a pinprick high above.\n\nHe slams into the ground and rolls down an incline. His glass are broken, but after checking himself for fractures he digs through a pocket and strikes a match.\n\nThe flickering yellow light casts long shadows away, he thinks he might have triggered a cave-in but he couldn't be sure... He'll have to examine this yellow flowstone to see how far down he might be.  the magnifying glass is safe in a pocket, and he's able to examine his surroundings. \n\nThe room is filled with smallish vases, jars, no, there's a better word. Urns! So many urns, they disappear from view into the gloom. He toes one with a boot; it\u2019s firmly embedded in the rock below. As he turns, a glint catches his eye. He wanders off looking for the source.\n\nAs the glow from his light fades away, the shadows cast by the urns stretch until they cover the chamber floor, all covered with strange markings and coated with millennia of dust. \n\nAll but one, just a single one that sits in the center of the room, gleaming as if new.\n\n>TL;DR: *A Benny shaved is a Benny urned.*\n",

He picks it up and excitedly brushes it off when suddenly a enormous genie appears.\n\n\"I am the Genie of the Lamp and I shall grant you one wish, if it is within my power.\"\n\nThe man thinks hard and slowly reaches into his pocket. He pulls out a map of the world and points out where he is from to the genie.\n\n\"My homeland is a sad, unhappy place. There is suffering and many people are dying. There have been decades of war and bitter feuding.\" The man points to all the countries in the region plagued by conflict and hardship, explaining to the genie the years of loss and troubles. \"The children of these countries have no hope for a prosperous future if this continues.\" He ends by holding out the map to the genie and says, \"My greatest wish is for peace in all the lands of the middle east so that happiness and joy returns to the hearts of all the people who live there.\" \n\nThe genie is touched by the man's selfless yearning.

She passed away earlier this year and I cannot begin to say how much I miss her jokes.  This one was the last one that she ever told me.  It wasn't the funniest by itself but to hear a little old lady at the other end of the phone that had to start over two or three times because she laughed so hard at herself was enough to have me rolling on the floor almost wetting myself from laughing.  I thought I would share:\n\nA man, we will call him John, went to the doctor.  John was a very proud and dignified man so to go to the doctor for a very bad case of constipation was terribly embarrassing for him.  \"The treatment is non-invasive,\" the doctor told him.  \"In a moment the nurse will be in and she will administer a warm water enema and followed by a mild laxative.\"  \"Non-invasive indeed\" thought John, and he was beside himself with indignity of the whole affair.  After receiving his treatment the nurse left John alone in the hospital room to wait for the effects to kick in.  \"Not so bad now,\" thought John, \"At least there is a nice view.\"  And it was a nice view because John's hospital room was high up in the tall hospital overlooking the city.  About that time John began to feel a movement within him.  \"O dear,\" he shouted, but before he could begin to move to the restroom he relieved himself all over his fresh, white, hospital sheets.  This was too much.  After momentarily relishing in the intense feeling of relief, John snapped back into his overly dignified demeanor and was in a panic.  \"No one can see me like this,\" he shrieked.  In a moment of desperation John grabbed up his soiled sheets and not knowing what else to do - threw them out of the hospital window.  \"That's that,\" he sighed with relief and the incredibly embarrassing moment had passed, at least for him.  About that time Clarence, the town drunk, was ambling by the hospital trying to find a way to hold his head that didn't hurt because of his terrible hangover.  *Sploosh*  The hospital sheets fell onto Clarence's head and the fight was on.  Never had you seen a man fight so viciously.  Even if the shit filled hospital sheets hadn't been covering him from head to toe, Clarence wouldn't have been able to see who or what was attacking him because the god-awful smell was burning his eyes.  He screamed and he kicked and punched and raised such a racket, a crowd started to gather around, but not too close, until finally a policeman blew his whistle and, knowing exactly who it was because he had just picked the drunk up the night before yelled, \"CLARENCE! CLARENCE! JUST WHAT IN GOD'S NAME ARE YOU DOING?\"  \"Thank god you are here, officer,\" Clarence gasped, trying to pull what was left of the sheets off of his dirty head, \"I'm not sure what the hell is going on myself...but I think I just beat the SHIT out of a GHOST!\"\n\n",

One day he met a girl and fell in love. When it became apparent that they would marry, he thought to himself, she'll never go through with the marriage with me carrying on like this, so he made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans.\nShortly after that they were married. A few months later, on his birthday and on the way home from work, his car broke down. Since they lived in the country, he called his wife and told her that he would be late because he had to walk home. On his way home, he passed a small cafe and the wonderful aroma of baked beans overwhelmed him. Since he still had several miles to walk He figured he could walk off any ill affects before he got home. It was, after all, his birthday. So he went in and ordered, and before leaving had 3 extra large helpings of baked beans.\nAll the way home he putt-putted. By the time he arrived home he felt reasonably safe. His wife met him at the door and seemed somewhat excited. She exclaimed, \"Darling, I have the most wonderful surprise for you for dinner tonight!\" She put a blindfold on him, and led him to his chair at the head of the table and made him promise not to peak. At this point he was beginning to feel another one coming on. Just as his wife was about to remove the blindfold, the telephone rang. She again made him promise not to peek until she returned, and away she went to answer the phone. While she was gone, he seized the opportunity. He shifted his weight to one leg and let go. It was not only loud, but ripe as a rotten egg. He had a hard time breathing, so he felt for his napkin and fanned the air about him. He had just started to feel better, when another urge came on. He raised his leg and RRIIPPP !!! It sounded like a diesel engine revving, and smelled worse. To keep from gagging, he tried fanning his arms a while, hoping the smell would dissipate. He got another urge. This was a real blue ribbon winner, the windows shook, the dishes on the table rattled and a minute later the flowers on the table were dead.\nWith his blindfold still on, when he heard the phone farewells he neatly laid his napkin on his lap and folded his hands on top of it. Smiling contentedly, he was the picture of innocence when his wife walked in. Apologizing for taking so long, she asked if he had peeked at the dinner table. After assuring her he had not peeked, she removed the blindfold and yelled, \"SURPRISE!!!\"\nTo his shock and horror, there were twelve dinner guests seated around the table for his surprise birthday party",

It only costs $10.\"*\n\n\nBill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10. \n\n\nThe computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. \n\n\nAfter a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: **\"You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be better in two weeks.\"** \n\n*Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever,* **he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled.** \nHe mixed together **some tap water**, a **stool sample from his dog** and **urine samples from his wife** and **daughter**. To top it off, **he masturbated into the concoction.** \n\nHe went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message: \n*\"Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic. Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer.* \n**And if you don't stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better.\"**\n\n[Source] (http://smile.xonaki.com/Joke/EN?categoryCode=EN&jokeId=15)",

She packed a basket full of apricot jam, roasted corned beef, and poached boar vascular system, and set out, tra-la-la, skip-skip-skip on the path through the forest.\n\nLittle did she know that the Big Bad Goat was lurking in the forest, looking for his next meal. He craftily sidled up to Little Red Riding Muscle Shirt and asked where she was going.\n\n\"Oh, to my dear sweet grandmother, Batilda,\" she said, guilelessly. \"It'll take me about a half hour to get there, because I'm going to pick some flowers along the way. Here are the GPS coordinates to her humble cottage.\"\n\nAnd so the Big Bad Goat snuck away, faster than Little Red Riding Muscle Shirt could go, and reached the cottage first. There he found the old grandmother sleeping in her bed, and he ripped her to pieces and devoured her on the spot. Then, creepily enough, he put on her clothes and got into her bed.\n\nLittle Red Riding Muscle Shirt came to the cottage and walked in the door. It was dim in the cottage, and Little Red Riding Muscle Shirt was also dim, and so she was fooled by the Big Bad Goat's disguise.\n\n\"Come lie in bed with me, dearie,\" the Big Bad Goat wheedled.\n\n\"What shall I do with my pair of stockings?\" the girl asked.\n\n\"Throw it in the fire; you won't need it.\"\n\n\"But what shall I do with my blouse?\" the girl asked.\n\n\"Throw it in the fire; you won't need it,\" the Big Bad Goat replied.\n\nAnd so it went, until Little Red Riding Muscle Shirt was down to just her Red Muscle Shirt.\n\n\"What about my precious Red Muscle Shirt?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh, leave that on, whatever, just hop in,\" the hungry Goat replied.\n\nSo Little Red Riding Muscle Shirt jumped into bed, and a little bird outside the window called, \"SLUT! Watch in whose bed you climb!\"\n\nBut Little Red Riding Muscle Shirt paid no attention to the bird's slut-shaming, and so the Big Bad Goat tore her limb from limb and ate her, too.\n\nBut a passing lumberjack heard the crushing, the screaming, and the gnawing of bone, and in he came, too late to do any real good, but he slaughtered the Big Bad Goat, making sure his death was slow and painful.

He approached her and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know me?' She responded, \u201cWhy, yes, I do know you, Mr. Williams. I've known you since you were a boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you.\u201d\n \nThe lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, \u201cMrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?\u201d\n \nShe again replied, \u201cWhy yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster, too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. One of them was your wife. Yes, I know him.\u201d\n \nThe defense attorney nearly died.\n \nThe judge asked both counselors to approach the bench and, in a very quiet voice, said, \u201cIf either of you idiots asks her if she knows me, I'll send you both to the electric chair.\u201d",

She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn\u2019t keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man\u2019s warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn\u2019t hear and, near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy.\n\nHe woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, \"Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest.\" \"Well, that\u2019s pretty crappy,\" he thought. \"If that\u2019s the best the old man can do then I don\u2019t have much to worry about.\" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read \"Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle.\" In a panic he glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, \"Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost.\"",

They said \"we are going to escape boys!\" \"We just need to get this dam door open!\" After hours of observation the one man in the corner refusing to help, just sat in the corner laughing  at them, almost as if he knew it was a fake door. The docters noticed this and turned their atention to him. He just continued to laugh as the rest of the men failed to open the door. Soon a docter said \" I don't think he is crazy... lets get him in another room... lets ask him a few questions.  In a smaller white room the docters ask the man \"Why where you laughing at the rest of the guys... did you know?\" The man then replies, \"I laugh because they think there going to get that \"Door\" open... but how can they do that when I have the only key!\" ",

Within this cave was a naturally flat boulder, which quickly became as the Round Table to these knights of the People.  The Party constitution was written upon it, plans drawn up upon it, debates held around it--and of course, there were rumors that it was occasionally used for more lecherous purposes.  It became known as the Rock of the Party.\n\nAfter much struggle, suffering, and bloodshed (and some insignificant help from the their Soviet comrades), the Communist partisans of Bulgoradia were able to expel the foreign invaders and bring their running dogs to heel.  They then set about creating a new government for the People--but a government needs a capitol, and the old royal palace was too damaged and too retrograde to serve.  A new capitol building was constructed, a suitable place from which the Party could guide the nation towards its rightful and glorious future.  It was called the House of the People.\n\nIt was determined, after the initial struggles of the Revolution and of building Communism were completed, that the artifacts of the revolution must be preserved and displayed for the good of the People.  Thus, a great expedition was sent out to the cave that housed their humble and desperate beginnings, and with much fanfare the Rock was brought to the glorious new capitol building.  The national paper breathlessly reported on that day:\n\n\"Party Rock Is In The House Tonight!\"",

Throughout sophomore and junior year, I put on several pounds and lost my athletic aesthetics. The summer of my junior year I was informed by my doctor that if I continued this unhealthy lifestyle, I could develop diabetes. Thoughts of running again and regaining my athleticism crossed my mind many times after that appointment. I resolved that immediately after I returned to school in the fall, I would start running again and get back on track. \n\n(I thought of this joke randomly and thought of a home for it.

He hadn't owned the bar long, but for the most part it was quiet in the town where he did his business.\n\nOne day, a cowboy in a panic ran into the bar screaming \"Everybody run for your lives! Awful Ed is coming to town!!!\". Almost instantly panic ensued and everyone in the bar rushed out or hid somewhere in the bar. The British bartender had never heard of the man, but due to the nature of how everyone else had reacted, this was not a man to be trifled with. However in his escape, he slipped on a bottle someone had knocked over in the panic and fell to the ground, knocking him out cold.\n\nWhen he came to, he found the bar to be empty and the town dead silent, he began to try to find a hiding spot when he suddenly heard the bar doors open, and he made the terrible mistake of turning to see who it was.\n\nThe man that stood at the door was gigantic and muscle bound in every way. Scars adorned his forearms and face, particularly one scar across his eye which was a milky white. Every step the man took seemed to cause demons to give him space. But the one thing the bartender noticed and could not tear his own eyes away from was a necklace with small round knuckle bones, quite possibly human bones.\n\nFrozen where he stood behind the bar, the bartender could barely keep himself together as the outlaw walked to the bar and took a seat. After a moment the British bartender asks \"W...w...what'll it be?\"\n\nThe outlaw, never meeting his eyes with the bartender says with a voice Satan would cower from \"I'll have the scotch, just give me the bottle.\"\n\nFearing what this man could do him, the bartender quickly grabs the scotch from the top shelf and hands it to the outlaw, who then takes the bottle, bites the neck off of it and drinks the contents.\n\nThe outlaw places the remains of the scotch on the table, gives a demon possessed \"Thanks\" and heads for the door.\n\nThe bartender, then meekly says \"Ww...ww...will that be all sir?\"\n\nThe scared outlaw turns back and says \"Nah. Besides, I'd be a damned fool if I were still in town when Awful Ed gets here.\"",

He had auburn hair, bright blue eyes, a masculine build and a perfect smile. However, one of his arms is devastatingly smaller than the other. Almost a stick, it hangs out of its socket. Nobody can take their eyes off it. \n\"Sorry, not this one. Next!\" says the lady. \n\nThe second man is a man with a similar masculine build, even more handsome then the man before him. He stood up firm and strong, with glistening green eyes. He was mesmerising to look at. At first glance he seems to be the perfect man. \n\"My god, you're gorgeous!\" squeals the woman. \nHe smiles, and immediately she sees that his teeth have rotted away. They are black and chipped, with an overwhelming stench filling the stage. \n\"I'm sorry, not this one either.\"\n\nCrossing her fingers, she hoped this third person had the least profound flaw. When the third man came out, he was certainly the most handsome man she had ever seen, obviously more handsome than the previously two. His entire body from head to toe, seemed to have been sculpted to perfection, every detail from his chiseled jawline to his pecs being seen from his custom made suit. His eyes were of light mahogany, a shade lighter than his slicked, combed hair. There was no doubt in her mind, she was going to marry this man. \n\"I pick this man!\" the woman cried. \"I'm going to marry this man! \n\nThe priest came out from behind the curtains, and they held hand in front of him. They couldn't take their eyes off each other. \n\"We're going to spend the rest of our lives together!\" the woman said in excitement. \n\"Yes we are, baby. Yes we are\"\n\nThe priest said his vows and married the two. They both kissed, the crowd awwing and cheering, both her parents crying tears of joy. \n\n\"Congratulations, newly weds.

When Farmer John rang the bell that day, Bessie didn't come, so Farmer John climbed the hill to see what was holding her up. When he arrived, he saw Bessie tied up. Confused, he undid the rope...and then, in the distance, he heard the cowbell. Before Farmer John could drop the rope, Bessie started sprinting towards the sound. The rope tangled around her feet, and she tripped and rolled down the hill, dragging Farmer John with her--tearing out the seat of his pants in the process. When they finally came to a stop, Farmer John's face was down in the dirt, and his bare rear end was pointed straight up in the air. Sam Spoon dropped the cowbell and started laughing, throwing his arm around the waist of Farmer John's wife. Farmer John was between Bessie and her meal, so the cow jumped over his moon.

We have every kind of hard alcohol imaginable, hundreds of Whiskeys, Vodkas, Rums, Scotches, Tequila, mixed drinks, wines, craft beers, even crappy cheap alcohol.

Cigarettes and cigars of every kind, we smoke hookah, we smoke whatever, all day long and the best part is you can never smoke too much in Hell, you don't get cancer and you don't get sick.\"\n\nSatan asks again, \"So, did you use drugs while you were alive?\" The guy says, \"Actually, I used drugs almost every day.\"  Satan goes on again, \"Well you're in luck, you will love Wednesdays, because on Wednesday we do drugs all day.  In Hell, we have every drug imaginable -uppers, downers, hallucinogens, and only the highest quality, and we sit around and do lots of drugs all day! Best part is, no overdose and no addiction in Hell.\"\n\nBy this point, the guy is starting to think that Hell sounds like a place he could get used to.  Then Satan asks him, in a quieter voice, \"By chance, in life were you a homosexual?\"\n\nThe guys responds \"No way, never, I'm as straight as it gets\"\n\nSatan grimaces and tells him \"Sorry, I don't think you're gonna like Thursdays very much.\"",

Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10.\" \nJeffery figured he had nothing to lose, so he took his urine sample to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief \npause, out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: \n\n\n\u201cYou have tennis elbow.\nSoak your arm in warm water.\nAvoid heavy lifting.\nIt will be better in two weeks.\u201d\n  \n\nLate that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction.\n  \n\nHe went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited $10.00. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message:\n\n\n\u201cYour tap water is too hard.\nGet a water softener.\n\nYour dog has worms.\nGet him vitamins.\n\nYour daughter's using cocaine.\nPut her in a rehabilitation clinic.\n\nYour wife's pregnant - twin girls.\nThey aren't yours.\nGet a lawyer.\n\n\nAnd if you don't stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better.\u201d\n",

He had tractor wallpaper, a tractor bed, tractor sheets, tractor pillowcases and not to mention all of the tractor toys which he would lovingly play with every day. \n\nOn Timmy's 13th birthday his parents decided to take him to a farm and let him ride in a tractor. Timmy was so excited as his dream of being in a tractor was finally becoming reality. After about 30 minutes of being driven round the farmer driving offered Timmy a quick ho behind the wheel. Timmy was thrilled, nothing could make him happier. As Timmy drove round the field he started to become more and more confident behind the wheel and this is when disaster struck. Timmy ,now not really concentrating on where he was going, hit a bump in the field and the tractor lost control and hit a tree. The farmer managed to escape but Timmy was caught between the tractor and the tree and passed out with pain. \n\nTimmy awoke a week later in his local hospital, both his parents were so relieved that he was awake they almost crushed him again. Unfortunately both of Timmy's legs were broken as well as his lower back. It took Timmy 2 and a half years to finally be back in control over his body and after months or grueling physiotherapy he was finally able to get back home. When he walked into his tractor covered room he almost broke down in tears. Timmy hated Tractors. Timmy never wanted to see another tractor again and so the next day his walls were stripped, his bedding changed and his toys put away and Timmy tried to move on with his life. \n\nThroughout his life growing up Timmy started to put the whole tractor incedent behind him and focus on his new goals in life such as a job or house or even a girlfriend but he never got rid of that hatred of all things tractor. \n\nWe now see Timmy in his mid 20's life's been good to him. He has a good job and has just moved into a new flat in a nice part of town. He pops into a bar on his way home from work for a quick drink. The bar was thick with smoke and Timmy could barley see in front of him. As he went up to the bar he noticed the most beautiful lady he had ever seen in his life. She had long golden hair that fell gracefully from her head. Her eyes were a deep green and her lips a dark red. As Timmy was thinking of something to say to her he noticed a single tear running down her cheek. \"Beautiful lady why are you crying\" Timmy asked. She looked up at him and explained that all the smoke was hurting her eyes and she was struggling to breath. Timmy new it was his time to shine. \"Never fear\" he said and stood up on the bar. He then took a deep breath and sucked in all the smoke from the bar, everyone was now staring at him as he casualy walked outside and exhaled all the smoke into the atmosphere. As he walked back in he heard the woman cry \"how on earth did you do that?!\"\n\"It's easy\" Timmy replied \"I'm an ex tractor fan\"",

The man looks inside and sees a centipede. \"I don't want just a boring old centipede\" said the man, \"I want something really cool.\" The manager assures the man that this centipede is no ordinary centipede. \"It's a talking centipede!\" With little hesitation, the man soon bought it and brought it home without even checking whether the man was lying. \nOnce home the man took the lid off of the centipedes box and asked \"say centipede, want to go to the pub and get a beer?\" The centipede said nothing, So the man put the lid back on and walked away. Two minutes later, the man walked over to the centipede's box again. He took the lid off and asked \"say centipede want to go to the pub and get a beer?\" Again, no reply. The man was starting to think he had been ripped off. But he decided to try again. He took the lid off one last time and asked \"say centipede, want to go to the pub and get a beer?\" At long last the centipede looked up and said \"I heard you the first time, moron. I'm getting my shoes on.\"\n",

Although his parents did not approve, he stubbornly married the woman and brought her to live in the home he shared with his parents. \n\nThe next day, Ram's mother, named Sita, made breakfast for the whole family. She lovingly made lunch for her husband and son to take to work. The white woman, however, stayed in bed long after the two men went off to work. When she finally came out of her room, Sita was shocked to see the white woman completely naked!\n\n\"Why aren't you wearing clothes?!\" asked Sita. \n\n\"This is my birthday suit. I was born in this suit, and this is the suit that I shall wear at home.\"\n\nSita tried to explain that the woman couldn't just walk around the house naked. What would Ram's father think?! The white woman ignored her requests.\n\nLater that evening, Sita spoke imploringly to her son. \"Ram, your wife is walking around in her birthday suit... These white people...!\"\n\n\"I don't mind,\" said Ram, laughing. \"I like it.\"\n\nShocked, Sita went to her own husband and explained the problem to him. \"Sita, she is making her husband happy. She should try to keep him pleased with her,\" said Ram's father. \n\nOver the next few days, Sita watched as her daughter in law walked around the house in comfort, and suddenly her own sari seemed like a burden to wear. She also noticed that her son couldn't keep his hands off his wife. Despite doing no housework at all, this white woman's birthday suit was keeping her husband very happy. \n\nSita decided to embrace her daughter in law's ways. The next day, her husband found her reclining peacefully on the couch, absolutely naked. \n\n\"What do you think? I'm in my birthday suit,\" she said, smiling. \n\n\"Sita, at least you should have ironed it!!\"",

Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home.  One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot.  He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food.  After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store.  In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off.  He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.  \n  \nAbout 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store.  His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving.  An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital.  He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical.  They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.  \n  \nThe dentist wakes to a knock on the door.  Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues.  Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door.  When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper.  He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.  \n  \nThe grim reaper swears.  \"Oh no!  This always happens with identical twins\".  \n  \n\"What do you mean?\"  asks the dentist.\n  \n\"Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld.  I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended.  I'll take my leave now.\"  \n  \nThe dentist is noticeably upset.  He says \"Wait!  Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life?  After all, YOU made the mistake.  Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life.\"  \n  \nThe grim reaper asks \"What do you have in mind?\"  \n  \nThe dentist thinks.  \"How about a challenge?  If I beat you, you let my brother go free.\"  \n  \nThe grim reaper laughs.  \"I will beat you in any challenge.  What challenge do you propose?\"  \n  \nThe dentist smiles.  \"I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth.  5 minute of brushing each, then we decide.\"  \n  \n\"Very well\" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.  \n  \nOnce there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull.  It's glistening.  He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes.  After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright.  The grim reaper grins.  \"You are foolish human.  But, you are entitled to your chance.\"\n  \nThe dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman.  When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste.  He smiles.  \n  \nIt's unbelievable.  \n  \nThe shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.  \n  \nThe winner is obvious.  The grim reaper hangs his head in shame.  \"You win, human.  This time.  Your brother will live.\"  He disappears in a puff of smoke.  At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital.  Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy.  Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings.  It's his brother, the dentist.  He picks up.  \"Hey bro.  You'll never believe what happened.  Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car.  They say I almost died.\"  \n  \nThe dentist smiles on the phone and says.  \"That's interesting, bro.  Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.\"  ",

Also at the top of the mountain, there was an ancient monastery where ancient monks lived.\n\nSometimes, the little boy, as he was riding his tricycle around his yard, would look up at the monastery on the tall mountain and wonder what it was like up there. \n\nOne day, when the wind was blowing down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold and the little boy could hear a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.\n\nSo, the little boy made a peanut butter sandwich, hopped on his tricycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours and hours, but he finally made it to the top. He bravely pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Monk, sir. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the head monk, \"I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\nSadly, the little boy got back on his tricycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.\n\nThe wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was a bit bigger and stronger now and now rode around town on his bicycle.\n\nAs luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.\n\nSo, the bigger boy made a ham and cheese sandwich, hopped on his bicycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.\n\n\"Hey, Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the head monk, \"I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\nSadly, the big boy got back on his bicycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.\n\nThe wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy had grown into a strapping youth now and rode around town on his motorcycle.\n\nAs luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.\n\nSo, the strapping youth grabbed a slice of pizza, hopped on his motorcycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 30 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.\n\n\"Yo, Mr. Monk, dude. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the head monk, \"I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\nSadly, the strapping youth got back on his motorcycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.\n\nThe wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was now a young man and often rode around in his new convertible sportscar.\n\nAs luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.\n\nSo, the young man bought a burger at a fast food place, got in his convertible sportscar, and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 20 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.\n\n\"Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the head monk, \"I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\nSadly, the young man got back in his convertible sportscar and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.\n\nThat night, he thought and thought about the very strange noise and how he just had to know what caused it. So, he resolved to do something about it the next day.\n\nThe next day, he got in his convertible sportscar and raced up the mountain, slammed on his brakes, and skidded to a stop right in front of the massive door to the monastery.\n\nHe honked the horn of his convertible sportscar until the head monk finally opened the door.\n\n\"Alright, Mr. Monk, I want to know what is making that very strange noise coming from you monastery!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the head monk, \"I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\n\"Well, then can I become a monk?\"\n\n\"Why certainly! It is quite easy. You must travel the earth and count the number of blades of grass in every field and the number of grains of sand on every beach. When you return with your answer, then you shall be a monk.\"\n\nSo the young man left the monastery and travelled the earth. For years and years he counted the blades of grass and grains of sand, until one day he had finally finished. He made his way slowly back to the monastery and found the head monk.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Monk, I have travelled the earth these past years, counting the blades of grass and grains of sand. I finally know that there are 123,123,123,123,123 blades of grass in the fields and 123,123,123,123,123 grains of sand on the beaches and I would like to become a monk.\" \n\nSo the man became a monk. At last, he would now be able to find out the source of that very strange noise coming from the monastery.\n\n\"Mr. Monk, what is the noise coming from the monastery?\" asked the new monk.\n\nThe head monk replied, \"The source is too complicated to describe in words. I am afraid that you must see it for yourself to truly understand it. This key will show you the answer you seek.\"\n\n\"Take this key to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. There you will find a long corridor. At the end of the corridor is a door and through the door is the thing that makes the noise.\"\n\nWell, of course the new monk went immediately to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and there he did indeed find the long corridor. He walked down the corridor until he could see the door at the end. \n\nUnfortunately, there were three magical fires that never go out blocking the man from the door. He decided to jump the fires to reach the door. The man made sure the key was secure in his hand, took a running charge at the first fire and leapt!\n\nOver the first fire he flew, but he dropped the key. The man leapt back over the fire, ran all the way back down the long corridor, out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and back to the head monk.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the first one as I leapt over it.\"\n\n\"Do not worry, for there is another key and you must overcome tests on your way to enlightenment. The second key, however is far, far away in Canada.\"\n\nThe new monk left the monastery and travelled to Canada. It took many years because he had no money, being a monk and all.\n\nEventually, he arrived in Canada and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. \n\nThe three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.\n\nOver the first fire went the monk, key still in hand!\n\nOver the second fire went the monk, key still- RATS!\nHe had dropped the key in the second fire. The monk leapt back over the second fire, back over the first fire, back down the long corridor he walked and out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. The monk went back to the head monk.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the second one as I leapt over it.\"\n\n\"Do not worry, for there is one more key and we must all overcome tests on our way to enlightenment. The third key, however is far, far away in Australia.\"\n\nThe monk left the monastery and travelled to Australia. It took many years because he had no money being a monk and all.\n\nEventually he arrived in Australia and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. By this time, he was quite an old monk.\n\nDown into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.\n\nOver the first fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!\n\nOver the second fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand! \n\nOver the THIRD fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!\n\nHe had made it! He'd made the jumps and here he was standing outside the door with the answer to his question. Finally, finally, after so many, many, many years of wanting to know what was making the strange noise, he would know. The answer lay through the door in front of him and he could at last be at peace with himself.\n\nSlowly, the quite old monk slid the key into the lock. Turning the key a slight 'click' was to be heard as the lock moved back allowing the quite old monk to open the door. He pushed the door open and stepped inside. \n\nShock and amazement came over him as he finally realized the answer to his question.\n\nHe had never seen anything like it.\n\n\n~\n\nDo you want to know what it was?",

        "body": "   So, there is a small village. In that village lives a race called the Trids. The Trids are kind honest creatures who enjoy everything from sports to movies. \n\n   Well away in the distance of the village there is a mountain, atop that mountain lives a giant. And every night that giant plays super loud and clamorous music. Well this angers the Trids since they are trying to sleep at this time. \n\n   One day the Trids decide they have to take care of this conflict. After long discussion the Trids come to a verdict. They decide that they will have to send someone up there to politely ask the giant to turn down his music. The next night one of the Trids hikes up the mountain and comes to the giant's house. He knocks on the door. The giant answers. The Trid says, \" Mr. Giant could you mind turning down your music just a tad so we could sleep at night? \" The giant laughs, and kicks the Trid all the way down the mountain. \n\n   The next day the Trids decide that they will have to try again. That night another Trid hikes up the mountain. He knocks on the door. The giant answers. The Trid says, \" Mr. Giant, I please aks you just to turn your music down so we can peacefully sleep at night. \" Once again the laughs. The giant raises his foot and kicks the Trid off of the mountain. \n\n   The next day the Trids decide that the third time must be the charm. Once again that night a Trid hikes up the mountain to confront the giant. He comes to the giants house and knocks on the door. The giant answers. The Trid says, \" I'm so sorry to bother you, but we just want to be able to sleep at night. It's hard when you are playing that loud music. Please turn it down. \" And again the giant laughs and kicks the Trid off the mountain. \n\n   The next day controversy rises in the town. The Trids are infuriated with this problem. No one knows what to do. In the town meeting that day the Trids discuss for hours on what to do. Finally one Trid comes to a conclusion. He says, \" Maybe the giant won't listen to us. Maybe, just maybe if we sned up someone else he will listen. \" The Trids compromise and conclude that this is the only option left. The Trids decide that the best person to send up the mountain would be a Holy man. A man of faith. Soon after a Rabi volunteers to do the job. \n\n   So that night the Rabi hikes up the mountain. He comes to the giant's house and knocks on the door. The giant answers. The Rabi says, \" Please Mr. Gaint could you please turn down that music so the Trids can sleep at night? And could you not kick me off the mountain? \" The Gaint laughs and says, \" Silly Rabi, kicks are for Trids. \" ",

One girl gets out of the car and fills her tank.  When she is done she goes into the station to fill up.  \r\r \r\rYou have to understand I am normally very shy and I cannot talk to women.  I have been single for long time and I said fuck it I\u2019m going to talk to these girls.\r\r \r\rI take this opportunity to talk to the other girl in the car.  We exchange pleasantries and after a few minutes of talking we exchange numbers.  This sort of thing NEVER happens to me.  I am beyond excited at this point.  I threw out the old 3 days rule and I called her that evening.  We talked for a while and decided to meet for a date the next day.  \r\r \r\rThe next day I pull up to her house and knock on the door.  Her dad opens the door.  As I am well out of college and was sure that she was much older this was a complete surprise to me. He is very pleasant and he invites me in.  I sit on the couch waiting for her.  She comes around the corner in a wheelchair!  As I only saw her sitting in the car I never suspected she was paralyzed.  It never came up in conversation either.  Her dad could tell by the look on my face that I was completely unaware of her condition.  He pats me on the shoulder and quietly whispers, \u201cshe does this a to unsuspecting guys,\u201d as if that was supposed to comfort me.  I liked the conversation we had so I decided to stick this out and continue with the date. \r\r \r\rWe go out to my car and I try my best to help her into my car without feeling her up too much, as I want to be a gentleman.  After I help her in I fumbled around with her wheelchair and get it loaded into my car the best that I can\r\r \r\rI had planned to take her to the park just down the road for a picnic.  I get her wheelchair unloaded and help her into it, which she is much better at doing on her own than getting into cars.  I grab all of the picnic stuff, the basket, and blankets and cooler.  My head is spinning how, am I supposed to carry all of this and push her to the area I had picked out?  I\u2019m fumbling with all of this and she says to me, there is a small area under the chair where you can put the blanket and I can hold the basket and cooler on my lap.\u201d  I am grateful for this and eagerly take her up on the offer.  We get out to the area and set up.  Things are going well and we talk well into the night.  \r\r \r\rThings start getting hot and heavy, we are making out and getting \u201chandsey\u201d.  At this point I have been sitting so long my ass is starting to hurt so I keep shifting uncomfortably.  She can tell how uncomfortable I am, she pulls back and looks at me says, \u201cDo you see that swing set over there?\u201d\r\r\u201cYes.\u201d\r\r \r\r\u201cTake me over there and I\u2019ll fuck you like you\u2019ve never fucked before.\u201d\r\r \r\rAt this point I\u2019ve been hard for a good 20 minutes so I eagerly take her up on the offer.  We go over there and she says \u201clift me up so I can grab the bar up there\u201d. \r\r \r\rAt this point I\u2019m a little confused but still hard as rock, I oblige.  I lift her up, she grabs onto the bar and says in a very sexy voice, \u201clift my skirt up and fuck me.\u201d  \r\r \r\rWe go at it for a while and with her hanging there, it was the best sex I\u2019d ever had in my life, hands down.  \r\r \r\rWhen we finish it is very awkward.  I have never had sex like that and it was amazing for me, and she kind of shrugs it off and with an emotionless voice says \u201cwe\u2019re done.\u201d\r\r \r\rI am taken aback by this and I don\u2019t really know what to say so I cleanup myself and our picnic, get her and all of my stuff loaded into the car.  We drive back to her house in the most awkward silence I have ever experienced in my life.  I get her wheelchair our and take her up to the house.  I try to kiss her good bye, and she gives me the cold shoulder.\r\r \r\rI am very confused by this and I don\u2019t know what to make of it.  I wait to see if she calls me.  With how coldly things ended I was not sure what I should do.  \r\r \r\rA few days later I was at the bar with my friends and see her dad out of the corner of my eye.  I am just hoping he does not see me, but alas he does.  He walks over and with hand out stretched he shakes my hand.  In his hand is a $100 bill.  At this point I am very confused.  Again he sees the confusion on my face and says \u201cMost guys just leave her in the park.\u201d\r\r \r",

After a few minutes of discussion the chief of the natives comes over and tells the men they can stay on one condition. He says \"each of you must go into the forest, find 2 fruits each and bring them back to the beach\". Simple enough. The men go into the forest and split up.. the black guy is the first to come back. He has a grape and a banana. The chief then tells him the second condition. \"You must now shove each of the fruits up your ass with it making a sound or we'll cut off your head\". Grudgingly, the black guy shoves the grape up and starts laughing. They cut off his head and goes to heaven. The white guy is the next to return. He has a strawberry and a banana. After being told the second part, he gets the strawberry, up and the banana half way before he starts laughing. They cut off his head and he goes up to heaven. While waiting to get into heaven the white guy asks the black guy what happened to him. \"He says the grape popped and it tickled, what about you? \" the white guy responds\n\"I saw the spaniard coming back with a pineapple and a watermelon\"",

Another popular myth is that Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually the Irish who romance women best, on average.\"\n\nVery interesting\" the man responds.\n\nSuddenly, the woman becomes very embarrassed, and blushes. \"I'm sorry,\" she says, \"I feel so awkward discussing this with you, and I don't even know your name.\"\n\nThe man extends his hand and replies, \"Tonto..........

Giuseppe, shocked at Giosetta's audacity didn't have the heart to tell his lovely wife of 15 years that her vagina smelled like the bottom of the ocean. He dodged the question by complimenting her excellent kitchen skills. The next day Giosetta paid a visit to her gynecologist and begged for his help. When the Doc put his head near her open thighs he knew right away what the problem was. He recommended some scented perscription strength lotions that kill bacteria and might actually entice Giuseppe to want to perform oral duties. The following day while making Spaghetti, Giosetta sat Giuseppe down and confessed that she knew why he didn't want to eat her out. She went on to explain how the Doctor had a variety of scented lotions, Cucumber and lime, Vanilla, lavender, peach, Mango and so on. Giuseppe was so delighted with Giosettas decision to fix the smelly problem he jumped up from the dinner table and asked, \"Oh Giosetta bella! What flavor did you picka for me!?\" Giosetta full of glee also jumps up from the dinner table and screams, \" I picka the Tuna Fisha!\"\n\n",

Never had he seen such perfection.\n\nJust then, a man shouted from across the mall \"Billy, it's time to go, your mother is waiting!\" The boy hopped up from the wheelchair and ran after him. The women were stunned. That's when an old man walked up and said \"isn't that just the sweetest little boy? He told me he didn't have much time left and he had never had a chance to ride in a wheelchair, so I let him borrow my wifes. Bless his soul.\"",

However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. \n\nFinally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.' \n\nThe father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.' \n\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball. \n\nThe boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again. \n\nThe next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. \n\n`Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, `If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' \n\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls. \n\nThe boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. \n\nThe next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. \n\n`Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' \n\n`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. \n\n`I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' \n\nAnd so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. \n\nThe boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. \n\n`Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' \n\nThe son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humour me, dear father.' \n\nThe carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. \n\nThe next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. \n\n`Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' \n\nOne of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. \n\nThe next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. \n\nThe following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. \n\nThe following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. \n\n`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' \n\nIt was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. \n\nThe next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. \n\n`Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' \n\nThat night, the son spent on board the tanker. \n\nThe next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. \n\nA few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. \n\nHis father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' \n\nWeakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' \n\n`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. \n\n`Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe son nodded weakly. \n\nThe next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. \n\n`Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,' the father requested. \n\nThe son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. \n\n`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. \n\n`I- I-' \n\nThen he died. \n",

He got accepted and once he graduated high school he headed off to training. After months of classes and tests, he was off to his first day of work as an apprentice. After a month of supervised driving, he was off on his own.\n\nHe was loving the job, every day he would go into work with a huge smile on his face. One day, a couple of his friends saw him driving and started yelling his name. He was waving to his friends when his car ran down a kid. Unfortunately, it was the son of a diplomat.\n\nA trial was held. He was distraught. The judge looked at him very solemnly as he told him that because of international relations reasons, the death penalty was his punishment. \n\nHe was asked what he wanted for his final meal and he kept it to what he was consuming when he first saw one of the trolleys going down the street. A glass of lemonade and a chocolate chip cookie. He got a $1.50 lemonade and a $0.25 cookie. It was kind of a letdown, but cookies are never going to be really bad, just not quite good. He was led to the electric chair and strapped in. The power was set to low because California likes to save money and go green. The executioner flipped the power switch and literally nothing happened. The voltmeter said that it was working but he was simply sitting there in the chair.\n\nDue to failed executions being seen as 'acts of god' he was let free. \n\nUpon his release he went to his old boss and begged for his job back. His boss agreed, but there were a few conditions. He would be in a probationary period for the next six months and he would have to redo his apprenticeship. The man agreed to the terms and was back operating the trolley the following Monday. \n\nHe was almost through the probationary period without incident and was feeling pretty good about his place in life right now. Everything was going well until one day he ate one of his roommate's brownies before work. He had no idea it was a pot brownie. He started to feel the effects on the route over, but couldn't call off without getting fired from his dream job. He tried to play it cool. Kept low key until he was on his street car. A kid started playing Skrillex and he was no longer able to pay attention. He only snapped back to his senses seconds before he rammed a fire truck. Three fire fighters died in that accident.\n\nHe was back in court. The diplomat whose son was killed started breathing fire down the neck of the judge again, so he was sentenced to the death penalty again. He requested the same final meal. It was the same $1.50 lemonade and this time a $0.75 cookie. It was a decent cookie. He accepted his fate again. The electrical connections on the chair were checked and rechecked before he got strapped in. The executioner stepped up the power level to medium, flipped the switch and again, nothing happened. The voltage levels were all correct, but the dude was just sitting there. So, again he was let free.\n\nThis time, he didn't even try to get his job back. He just went and stole a trolley. A pack of girl scouts were crossing the street, so he floored it. Blood, guts and limbs flew everywhere. In the end, 5 died, 3 suffered permanent injury and 2 ended up needing major therapy.\n\nThe trial was quick this time. Malice of forethought, tons of witnesses, it was pretty clear cut that this dude should die for what he has done. Same final meal request. This time it was the same $1.50 lemonade, but it was a $5 cookie. This was the mac daddy of all chocolate chip cookies. He casually strolled to the electric chair, got strapped in. The executioner turned the power as high as it can go and flipped the switch. A few sparks flew from the high voltage, but again, the guy was unscathed.\n\nThe executioner who was fed up with this dude still being alive asked \"Okay, I've tried to kill you three times and literally nothing has happened. What the hell gives?\" To which he replied, \"Well, I never really was a good conductor.\"",

One sale a day might have been acceptable in North Dakota , but you're not on the farm anymore, son.\"\n\nThe kid took his beating, but continued to look at his shoes, so the boss felt kinda bad for chewing him out on his first day. He asked (semi-sarcastically), \"So, how much was your one sale for?\"\n\nThe kid looks up at his boss and says \"$101,237.65\".\n\nThe boss, astonished, says $101,237.65?!? What the heck did you sell?\"\n\nThe kid says, \"Well, first, I sold him some new fish hooks. Then I sold him a new fishing rod to go with his new hooks. Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the boat department and I sold him a twin engine Chris Craft. Then he said he didn't think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him down to the automotive department and sold him that 4x4 Expedition.\" \n \nThe boss said \"A guy came in here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a boat and a TRUCK!?\"\n \nThe kid said \"No, the guy came in here to buy tampons for his wife, and I said, 'Dude, your weekend's shot, you should go fishing.\u2019  \n",

As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest.\n\nAfter a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, \"I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.\"\n\nThe distressed woman wailed,\"Are you sure?\"\n\"Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,\" replied the vet..\n\n\"How can you be so sure?\" she protested. \"I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.\"\n\nThe vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and\nshook his head.\n\nThe vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.\n\nThe vet looked at the woman and said, \"I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.\"\nThe vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..\n\nThe duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. \"$150!\" she cried, \"$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!\" \nThe vet shrugged, \"I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $150.\" ",

Furthermore, his actions were disgusting and well deserving of the punishment.\n\nMy problem here is that you initially only issued a 2 game suspension, and I consequently wasted my 6th round draft pick in my Fantasy League this year on him.  While he is a horrible person and plays for a terrible team, his fantasy value at the 6th round was very difficult to pass on, especially knowing that his punishment had already been put in place.  \n\nYou have compromised my season at this point in time and I am very unhappy with you.  I am open to any compensation for your actions and how they have costed me this season.  Last year I was coach of the year in my league and this season I just look silly.  Some ideas for compensation in recognition for your negligence and carelessness are listed below, but I am always open to fresh ideas as well.\n\nReimbursement for my dues in the league\nCo-manage my team - that's right - get me out of this hole you dug\nTickets to a Steelers game\nSteelers hat or gear\nSincere apology (obviously signed and mailed)\nSuspend another Running Back and give me the heads up in advance so I can handcuff the backup (I'm thinking Forte or Shane Vareen)\n\nThanks for you time and best of luck this season.\n\nDavid",

The bar was a sophisticated lounge, resting on the 101st floor of a high rise in a metropolitan city.  The two men were obviously drunk and began boasting of wild nights, great adventures, and making outlandish claims.   Finally, the first one says to the next, \"Did you know that on certain days when the wind is blowing just hard enough, the air on the side of this building will get squeezed between the other skyscrapers? It'll blow upwards and push anything you drop from here straight up and back onto the ledge of this lounge?\"  The second man thought this was too much and demanded proof.  \n\nSo the two went to the patio and approached the ledge. The second man offered first to drop his beer off but the bartender protested, not wanting to his someone below.  He then suggested he drop his shoe, but he said he liked them too much and didn't want to lose them.  At last the first man said, \"I'll jump.\"  The second man was too drunk to think it through and said go ahead.\n\nThe first man stepped up to the ledge, took a deep breath and before anyone could stop him he jumped.  Down the first man flew, faster and faster, picking up speed and shrinking away from view...then suddenly a gust of wind picked up and the mans clothes fluttered and he swooped, nearly hitting the street, and started to rise.  Up and up he went until just as he reached the patio he set his feet down and raised his arms in a great 'ta-da'!  The bar patrons cheered and roared in delight.  \n\nThe second man having a great bit of courage from seeing his new friend's feat stepped up to the ledge himself.  He took a deep breath and jumped over the ledge.  He fell faster and faster, picking up speed and shrinking away in view.  Then suddenly....thud.  He hit the pavement.  Splattered like a big on a windshield. \n\nThe first man laughed, finished his beer and walked back to his seat.  He sat there for another hour or so.  The bartender, who had watched the whole episode was stewing away in his thoughts.  Staring at the patron.  As his anger grew, his stare become red hot.  Until finally his irritation over what had happened stirred his movements.

The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.\n\nRemembering the encounter in 1986, Mbembe couldn't help wondering if this was the same elephant.\n\nMbembe summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure.

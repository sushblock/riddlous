In fact, I'd suggest you go find an inn to spend the night as soon as you can.\"\n\n\n\"No way!\" says the man. \"Do you know how far I've traveled? I need a few drinks to get myself back together.\"\n\n\n\"Okay\" says the bartender, \"but don't expect me to stick around here while the Black Knight is at large. But if you want your drinks that much, you can stay, I'll leave the door open for you to leave when you want, but get the drinks yourself, then you can pay me tomorrow.\"\n\n\nThe man agrees to this bargain. He's not going to let some local superstition ruin his rest. So he stays there and drinks peacefully when all of the sudden, someone kicks the door open. He sees a large dark silhouette of a man that is approaching him. The thought that the Black Knight has found him terrifies him and he panics. He drops to his knees and says:\n\n\n\"Please! I beg you, please, don't kill me! I'll do anything!\"\nThe large man with undistinguishable features takes out his dick and says in an authoritarian and commanding manner: \"Suck it if you want to live!\"\n\n\nThe man sees no other way to get out of this mess, starts doing the dirty business while cursing his stubbornness for not listening to the bartender.\n\n\nIn the last minutes before midnight, the large man pulls back his dick in his trousers, and gets ready to go. The other man looks at him surprised and says:\n\n\n\"Excuse me if I bother you,but you didn't even finish, why did you suddenly decide to go?\"\n\n\nThe mysterious man says:\"I just want to go home before the Black Night comes to town.\"\n",

Unhappy with this answer, the thug tells them that he will shoot them anyways since they know his identity now.

The challenge is; if all three of your penis sizes equal 15 inches I'll let you live.\" Seeing no other way out the three men agree. The black man goes first and pulls down his pants. To everyone's surprise his penis measured 9 inches. The white man went next and his penis measured 5 inches. At this crucial moment, everyone's eyes shifted to the Asian man. The Asian took a deep breath and unzipped his pants. It's EXACTLY ONE INCH! Everyone jumped up in the air and started screaming like they just won the super bowl. Stunned, the thug stood true to his word and left them in peace.

        "body": "In a beautiful small town not far from you is a man known as Joe the Good Conductor.  Being quite wealthy, Joe is the proud owner of a train that he operates every day, carrying townsfolk around the city almost free of charge.\n\nI say almost free of charge, because there in an archaic law in place that prohibits operating any form of transportation service for free. This law dates back to a time when horse and carriage drivers were almost run out of business by large conglomerate that tried to provide the service for free until they all went bankrupt, at which point it would drive up the prices.\n\nSure, the townsfolk could vote to change the law, but the minimum set by the municipality is only one cent, and there's something charming about paying a penny for anything these days.\n\nSo at every stop, Joe proudly steps off of the train and onto the platform where he invites people to take a ride on his train: \"Anywhere you want to go for only a penny per stop!\"  He even dresses like a conductor would in the 1920's.  It's all very show.\n\nTownsfolk with somewhere to be or nothing to do climb aboard Joe's well-kept locomotive and off they go toward the next stop.  As part of the fanfare, Joe leaves his apprentice to run the train between stops while he himself makes the rounds collecting each passenger's penny.\n\nDuring one such trip, Joe arrives at a seat occupied by a sweet old lady and, as he does with all of his passengers, kindly requested the penny.\n\n\"Oh Joe, I'm sorry.  I don't have my penny ready.  I'll just have to get it from my purse.\"\n\nJoe smiles and patiently waits as the old lady pulls out her suitcase, opens it and pulls out her knitting bag, opens that and pulls out her purse, opens that and pulls out her wallet, opens that and pulls our her change purse, opens that and pulls out a penny.  She hands the penny to Joe who politely says, \"Thank you!\", as he is known to do.  She then closes her change purse and puts it in her wallet, closes her wallet and puts it in her purse, closes her purse and puts it in her knitting bag, closes her knitting bag and puts it in her suitcase, and finally closes her suitcase and slides it back under the seat in front of her.\n\nOn his way back to the cab Joe thinks to himself, *It would have saved a bit of time if only she'd had her penny ready.  Oh well.  Maybe I'll suggest that next time.*\n\nAfter the next stop, Joe begins his rounds again collecting pennies to and fro.  Despite the absurdity of the ritual, he's grown to really enjoy this part.  It's a great way to meet people, and say, \"Hello!\"\n\nHe arrives back at the old lady again, and with his best smile says, \"Hello again, Ma'am.  May I please collect the payment of one penny?\"\n\n\"Is it that time already?\" she asks.\n\n\"After every stop,\" says Joe.\n\n\"I just have to get it from my purse.  It will only take a minute.\"\n\nSo the old lady pulls out her suitcase, opens it and pulls out her knitting bag.  She opens her knitting bag and pulls out her purse.  She opens her purse and pulls out her wallet.  She opens her wallet and pulls out her change purse.  She opens her change purse and pulls out a penny and she hands it to Joe.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Joe says politely.  \"Perhaps next time you could have it ready when I come around?\"\n\n\"Of course, Joe,\" replies the old lady, who then closes her change purse and puts it in her wallet.  She closes her wallet and puts it in her purse.  She closes her purse and puts it in her knitting bag.  She closes her knitting bag and puts it in her suitcase.  She closes her suitcase and slides it under the seat.\n\nThe train stops at its next destination.  Some people get off; some people get on.  And the little journey continues.\n\nThis time, Joe decides, he'll make sure when he goes about collecting the pennies to talk loudly.  This will give the old lady plenty of notice so that she has the penny ready.\n\n\"Hello!\" Joe says loudly to this passenger and that.  \"I'm here to collect the fee of one penny, please!\"\n\nEventually, he arrives at the old lady.\n\n\"Oh hello, Joe!\" she says.  \"I'm sorry.  I forgot all about the penny.  Just give me a minute here...\"\n\nShe pulls out her suitcase, opens it and pulls out her knitting bag; opens her knitting bag and pulls out her purse; opens her purse and pulls out her wallet; opens her wallet and pulls out her change purse; opens her change purse and pulls out a penny and she hands it to Joe who takes a deep breath and says, \"Ma'am.  If you would be so kind as to have the penny ready the next time I come around...\"\n\nAnd she says, \"Of course, Joe.  Sorry to make you wait.  I'll be ready next time.\"  Then she closes her change purse and puts it in her wallet; closes her wallet and puts it in her purse; closes her purse and puts it in her knitting bag; closes her knitting bag and puts it in her suitcase; closes her suitcase and slides it under the seat.\n\nAfter the next stop, as Joe begins his rounds, he can't help but think, *I really hope she has the penny ready.  I mean, here I am saying,* \"Good afternoon, sir.  May I collect the payment of a penny, please?\" *loud enough I'm certain people think I'm going deaf.  She's sure to have it ready this time.  There's no reason not to.*\n\nOf course, when it's time to collect from the little old lady she shakes her head and say, \"Oh Joe.  I've forgotten again, haven't I?\"\n\nSo she pulls out her suitcase, opens it and pulls out her knitting bag; opens her knitting bag and pulls out her purse; opens her purse and pulls out her wallet; opens her wallet and pulls out her change purse; opens her change purse and pulls out a penny and she hands it to Joe, who through clenched teeth says, \"Thank you, and ma'am, I implore you.  Please have the penny ready next time.\"\n\nAnd the old lady says, \"I promise.\"  She smiles and closes her change purse and puts it in her wallet; closes her wallet and puts it in her purse; closes her purse and puts it in her knitting bag; closes her knitting bag and puts it in her suitcase; closes her suitcase and slides it under the seat.\n\nAs Joe marches back to the cab he thinks *If that **bitch** doesn't have that goddamn penny ready next time...*\n\nIt's next time and Joe goes about collecting pennies loudly, and occasionally making eye contact with her.  Each time he does, he smiles back.  She's sure to have the penny ready this time, but to be certain Joe makes it a point to visit her last.\n\nHe takes a deep breath, and asks, \"May I have my penny now, please?\"\n\nThe old lady says, \"Of course.  Let me just get it out of my purse.\"\n\n**BANG!**\n\nJoe shoots her in the head, killing her instantly and violently.\n\nObviously, Joe is taken to trial and put before Mike the Good Judge.  Being a small town, Joe knows Mike, who upon seeing him enter the courtroom can't help but ask, \"Joe, really, what were you thinking?\"\n\n\"I guess I just lost my cool,\" Joe says.  \"There's no excuse for it.\"\n\n\"There really isn't,\" says Mike.  \"Joe, we've known each other a long time, but you understand that for this crime I have no choice but to sentence you to death.\"\n\nJoe politely nods and replies, \"I understand.  You do what you have to do.\"\n\nJoe is then taken to the electric chair where he is strapped in by an old friend, Bob the Good Electrocutioner.  Bob is quite surprised to see Joe and immediately asks, \"What the hell did you do to get *here*, Joe?\"\n\nJoe replies, \"I killed an old lady in cold blood.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Bob, \"You know what comes next.  Wish it weren't so, but it's my job and I gotta get it done.\"\n\n\"You do what you have to do, Bob,\" says Joe, as Bob straps him into the chair.\n\n\"Now Joe, it's my job to do you in, but on account of our history and what not, I'm gonna put this here thing on the lowest setting.  This way it shouldn't hurt to much.\"\n\nJoe politely replies, \"Thanks, Bob.  You're a good friend.\"\n\nBob sets the electric chair to low and throws the switch.  Joe starts convulsing and whatnot, but even after 10 seconds he's still alive.  Bob turns off the chair and says, \"Joe, I'm sorry to have to do this, but you're just not dying so I'll have to turn it up.  This one is going to hurt more.\"\n\n\"No worries, Bob,\" says Joe.\n\nBob sets the electric chair to medium and throws the switch.  Joe starts to thrashing around even more violently, but after another 10 seconds he's still alive.  Bob turns off the chair and says, \"Joe, I really hate to do this to you, but I'm just gonna have to set this thing to high.  I ain't gonna lie: it's gonna hurt like hell.\"\n\n\"That's okay, Bob,\" replies Joe.  \"This is your job and you do what you gotta do.\"\n\nBob cranks the electric chair up to high and throws the switch.  Joe is shaking around so hard that the bolts holding the chair in place start to rattle loose.  Lights begin to flicker.  The crackling of electricity is blinding and deafening.  But after 10 seconds, Joe remains alive.\n\nBob approaches Joe in disbelief and begins to unstrap him.  \"In all my years, I've never had a failed execution.  Joe, you know the law: if you survive execution you walk free.  But before you go, I must know.  How did you do it?  How did you survive?\"\n\nJoe smiles and replies, \"I'm Joe the Good Conductor.\"",

He strikes up a conversation with the two workers, who coincidentally are also on their lunch break. \n\n\"So, uh,\" Jack starts, \"I noticed you two were digging and filling up holes. Is their a problem with the park?\"\n\nThe first worker says, \"Oh, no problem, bub. We're just planting. Usually, I dig the hole, Bob plants the tree, and Al fills the hole. Problem is, Bob's sick today.\" ",

But more upsetting is the fact that he knows everyone in town, since they are all members of his congregation, and he cannot figure out who would have stolen his prized possession.\n\nHe is still stewing about this during the church elder meeting and not sure what to do when one of his deacons comes up with a suggestion.\n\n\"This Sunday, why don't  you preach on the Ten Commandments and when you get to the command 'Thou shall not steal' you can rain down the fire and brimstone and preach so convincingly that the thief will be overcome with guilt and repent of their sin and return your bike?\" Says deacon Jones. Everyone agrees that this is a great plan.\n\nOn Sunday, the church is full and the pastor goes about his plan. He is going strong but halfway through his sermon, he changes topics and starts preaching about grace and forgiveness. After the service is over and all the people  have filed out of the church, deacon Jones comes over to the pastor and says, \"What happened? I thought you were going to preach heavily on stealing to weed out our thief.\"\n\nThe pastor replies, \"Well, I was. But then I got to the commandment 'Thou shall not commit adultery' and I suddenly remembered where I left my bike.\"",

Because of this, he decides that he needs to put down the prices - It's been months since he'd had a job and his family was struggling.\n\nHe takes the price down to $10 000 a hit to $5 000, but still no-one's coming through the door. He drops it to $1 000, then to $500, $100, $50, $20, $5 and still no-one comes in. In a final act of desperation he drops his price to $1.\n\nThis move pays off as the very next day a shady looking character walks into his office and asks if he's the guy offering \"Services\" for a buck. Once they clear up that he is indeed an assasin, not a pimp, the customer hands him a file on the target.\n\nArtie follows his quarry around for a few days, before trying to stage a couple of \"accidents\" for him, all of which the man manages to obliviously foil. Artie is getting frustrated and is tailing him late one night and the man goes into a supermarket. Because it's late no-one is around, so he decides to do the deed there and then, in the fruit and veg aisle.\n\nLike a lion stalking an antelope, Artie sneaks up behind the target and gets a hand over his mouth and and an arm around his neck and silently chokes him out. With his job done, Artie tries to hide the body under the shelves, but as he's doing that the only other customer in the store comes into the aisle, a little old lady, and before she can scream he has tackled her to the ground and is throttling her on the floor. Just after she's been dealt with the store manager, having heard some commotion, runs in and Artie is faced with no choice but to snuff him too. Not wanting to spend any more time in the store, he flees, satisfied with a job well done, even if it wasn't as quiet as he'd hoped.\n\nUnbeknownst to our good friend Arthur, all of this was caught on the store's security tapes and he was promptly arrested.

The island is connected to the mainland via a bridge and the Trids have to cross this bridge to gather food for the Trid village.\n\nUnfortunately, there's a large Troll that lives under the bridge that likes to kick unsuspecting Trids into the water when they come by.  Oh did I mention that Trids melt when they come into contact with water?  Anyway, these Trids have tried various methods of dealing with the Troll (usually via sending more Trids across than the Troll can kick) until one day they just can't do it anymore.  There aren't enough Trids left to swarm the Troll.  Despair sets in.  Luckily, a wandering Rabbi finds his way to the Trid village and is greeted warmly by the Trid chief.  \n\n\"Rabbi, Rabbi, please help us.\" says the Chief Trid\n\"What can I do for your people?\" responds the Rabbi.\n\"Please, would you gather the food for my people because we can no longer deal with the Troll in our usual way as our numbers have been decimated.\" Chief Trid pleads\n\"Sure\" the Rabbi responds.\n\nSo, the Rabbi spends the next few days making trips across the bridge to gather food for the Trid village, having not once been bothered by the Troll.  \n\nFinally, one day, tired of making trips across the bridge and eager to find a solution to the Trids Troll problem, the Rabbi stops to talk to the Troll.\n\n\"Troll,\" says the Rabbi, \"I have made dozens of trips across this bridge to gather food for the Trids, and not once have you tried to kick me.  Why is that?\"\n\nThe Troll replies smugly, \"Oh silly Rabbi, kicks are for Trids.\"",

It takes some acting, and can only be used in certain situations, but I've had rooms of people rolling on the floor.\n\nThis joke works best when you are in a group of people all trading jokes.  When it comes to your turn, tell the first part:\n\n\"A fisherman goes out on the ocean in his boat early one morning, and brings with him a box of donuts for breakfast.  As he's fishing, one of the donuts stands up out of the box and proclaims \"I'm a donut!  I'm a donut!\"  The fisherman says \"You're a donut!  You're not supposed to talk!  Do it again and I'll throw you into the ocean!\"  so the donut goes back in the box.  An hour of fishing goes by, and again, the donut gets up and proclaims \"I'm a donut!  I'm a donut!\"  The fisherman says \"What the hell donut!  I already warned you once!  If you talk again I'm throwing you into the ocean!\"  So the donut goes back into the box.  Another hour of fishing goes by, and finally the donut gets up again and proclaims \"I'm a donut!  I'm a donut!\"  The fisherman screams \"THAT'S IT!!!\"  And throws the donut in the ocean!!!!\"\n\nThe point is that the joke doesn't make sense, but still your job is to try and sell it to the group.  Keep saying things like \"C'mon!  Don't you get it?  He throws the donut in the ocean!!!\".  Watch as your friends groan and roll their eyes at what they perceive to be a really dumb joke with no real punchline.  Patience my child...  Sweet retribution is nye...\n\nLet a few more jokes go around the circle, and then proclaim that you have another!  Your friends are already skeptical of your joke telling abilities, but tell them this one they'll never see coming!:\n\n\"So a man decides he's going to propose to his girlfriend, so he picked a beautiful seaside dock just as the sun is rising as the romantic setting for this memorable event.  He gets down on one knee, asks her to marry him, and she says yes!  But just as he is about to slip the ring on her finger, he drops the ring, which hits the floor, rolls off of the dock, and right into the water.  He searches for hours, diving up and down to try to find the ring but to no avail.  Finally, his now fiance says \"I don't care about the ring so much.  I love you and that's all that matters.  We should celebrate!\"  So they go out to a very expensive seafood restaurant, and the woman orders the lobster, caught fresh that day.  She opens up the lobster, and guess what she finds inside...........?!\"\n\nAgain your friends will look at you like you're an idiot.  Watch with amusement as they all roll their eyes again and say the logical conclusion \"The ring.....\".  That is when you emphatically shout:\n\n\"THE DONUT!!!!!\"",

Besideds, he loved sailing since he was a child.\n\nAfter some effort, his team found a nice 40 foot sail boat, and the owner was a Catholic so he gave the Pope an extra nice deal.

Unfortunately, as they lay at anchor in a shallow harbor overnight to sleep, the wind shifted and the waves picked up.  Unbeknownst to the crew, there were some shallow rocks that they hadn't noticed, and the boat came up on the rocks.  Very quickly the rocks began to break into the hull in several places, and water began rushing in!\n\nFortunately, as the boat began breaking up on the rocks, the crew got the Pope and all of the important things into the dinghy and headed for the island.  The Pope looked back as they went, and saw that a huge chunk of the hull had been completely torn away, leaving the entire inside of the boat open to the sea.

They mostly involved exaggeration of body parts especially balls, boobs and dicks; dead babies; boys vs. girls; and bathrooms.  I would not consider using any of them in sentient company today - they're probably not even funny any more, and may be more interesting as expressions of a certain social milieu.  But this is online, where it's all anonymous and nobody remembers what you said! :D\n\nOne of those I sorta remember but not enough, so I found an example [online](http://www.rollitup.org/t/ive-got-a-joke-for-ya.808882/page-3) (credit where credit is due - it was the first link).  It's a little different but it will do.  I cleaned up the syntax and wording a bit but it's still a stupid joke!\n\nThere is this really beautiful woman who has to pick between 3 men who want to marry her.  (I don't know why - maybe it's a tribal thing.)  She tells them, \"I will marry the one with the biggest balls.  Every one come here to my house in three nights and show me what you've got.\"\n\nSo the 1st guy goes to doctor and says, \"Doc, I need something to make my balls bigger.\"\n\nThe Doc says, \"Take these pills every 12 hours.  It will probably itch, but that's OK.\"\n\nThe 2nd guy goes to doctor and complains, \"Doc, I need to make my balls bigger, what can I do?  I need your help! I'll pay extra!\"\n\nThe Doc says, \"Take these pills every 6 hours.  It will probably burn a bit, but that's OK.  Just use a little cortizone cream on the area.\"\n\nThe 3rd guy has a more ambitious plan and says, \"Doc I need to make my balls bigger than these other two guys.  Please help me, I'll pay double, and I have a couple of cruise tickets I can give you.\"\n\nThe Doc responds to this exercise in supply/demand economics, and tells him, \"Take these pills every hour.  But be careful!  Things can happen very fast, and it works a little differently on everybody.  And it's going to burn like fire, but you'll just have to put up with it.\"\n\nSo the 3rd night comes around.  The woman waits anxiously for the men, but finally there is a knock on the door.  \"Come in\" she replies. The 1st man comes in and drops his pants.  He's got huge balls, each the size of a football. Very impressed, and getting turned on already, she fondles them joyfully until there is another knock on the door.\n\nImmediately the 2nd man comes in and drops his pants.  His balls are each the size of a basketball!  The beautiful woman drools despite herself - never before has she desired any man as much as they've all desired her!.  She entertains herself by stroking and cuddling up with these huge monuments to manhood.\n\nA couple of hours go by. She continues to wait, even though she's all ready to marry no. 2, it's a fair contest and it's not midnight yet.  At 11:49 the 3rd man still hasn't showed and she is just getting ready to pick the 2nd man.  Suddenly the door bursts open. The 3rd man walks in and grins at the woman.  She asks, \"What's going on, are you ready to drop your pants?\"\n\nHe says, \"No need, you'll see.\" Then he turns around and says, \"Roll 'em in, boys!\"",

Of course, Steve didn\u2019t want the blame placed on his hands for the murder, so he sought a Hitman!\n\n\n\nA few nights later, Steve met his buddy at the local bar and he started talking about how he was going to hire a contract killer to take care of his wife. His friend suggested a local guy who does a great job, \u201cLil Arty\u201d. Steve seemed impressed with the initial recommendation and made plans to meet Arty in person.\n\n\n\n2 nights later, he met him behind the bar.

I can\u2019t afford that! I don\u2019t even have that much in savings!\u201d\n\n\n\nArty looked pissed, clenching his fists, desperate for the job. \u201cWell, what have you got on you right now?\u201d\n\n\n\nSteve fumbled through his pockets and found a mere $1 bill and a quarter. With a gulp, he handed the dough over to Arty. \n\n\n\nArty scowled, obviously pissed.

Like a bullet, Arty ran up to him, wrapped his hands around his scrawny neck and snapped it like a twig. He too was dead. But it was all over for him, as out of nowhere, 4 cops showed up and booked him. \n\n\n\nThe next day, the local papers ran a headline.\n\n\n\n**\u201cArty Chokes! 2 for $1.25 in Wal-Mart\u201d**\n",

        "body": "One day when ploughing the fields he sees a notice pinned to a tree just outside his land. It read:   \n*The infamous travelling tractortent has arrived in town! Hundreds of tractors all inside one massive tent! Raffle for a chance to drive a shiny top-of-the-range tractor!*  \nHe didn't have anything planned and he liked the sound of driving a top-of-the range tractor. He arrived at the tent and saw two stands by the entrance - he could buy either a pie or a raffle ticket for \u00a31.  *Pie, or ticket... pie, or ticket?* He buys a ticket and goes inside the tent, he looks at his ticket and remembers that his number is 302. The tent was arranged with hundreds of rows of seats, all arranged in concentric rings around a circle of open space in the centre where hundreds of tractors were laid out and in the centre of the tent, raised on a podium and gleaming even in the shade of the tent. He looked around at the different tractors for a few minutes until several large loudspeakers announced that the raffle would commence and asked everyone to take a seat. A random member of the audience was picked to come up and pick the winning raffle ticket. There was deathly silence as they rummaged to the very bottom of the basket, then held aloft a ticket. The announcer took the ticket and read the number... 302!  \n\n\n The farmer couldn't believe his luck - tears were streaming from his eyes and there was a ridiculous grin on his face as he stood and was helped into the tractor and given the keys. He floored the accelerator and swung the steering wheel to the right - straight into one of the tent supports. Suddenly the whole tent started to collapse and screaming families hurried out of the collapsing tent... The farmer was banned from ever returning to the festival. \n\n\n20 years later, while ploughing his fields the now old farmer, who had long ago lost the appeal of tractors, was ploughing his fields when he saw a notice pinned to a tree. It was the travelling tractortent, which had made a complete lap of the world! He thought he might have a look, he told himself that if they remembered him he would just leave. He arrived at the tent and saw two stands by the entrance - he could buy either a pie or a raffle ticket for \u00a31.  *Pie, or ticket... pie, or ticket?* He buys a pie and goes inside the tent. He sat down in the stands eating his pie until several large loudspeakers announced that the raffle would soon commence and asked everyone to take a seat. A member of the audience was picked out, and the number 203 was picked.\n\n\n A young farmer stood and was helped into the tractor and given the keys. He floored the accelerator pedal and swerved sharply to the left, crashing into the tractor display. All of the tractors started to smoke, quickly filling the tent with noxious fumes. The old farmer ran to help the young farmer out of the tractor and walked him outside. The old farmer then stuck his head into the entrance flap, took a huge breath and sucking in smoke. He then turned his head away from the tent and blew the fumes into the outside air. He repeated this twice more, and the tent was clear of smoke. A safety team went in and found the tent to be completely safe. The remaining members of the crowd were ushered back into the tent and the old farmer was taken up to the podium and asked both who he was and how he was able to clear the smoke out of the tent so easily. He simply stated: \"I am an ex-tractor fan\".",

They listen very, very carefully...but they hear nothing.\n\n\nAnd then, from behind, a little white goat comes bolting through the trees, screaming.

Furious, he throws the door open to find his wife, sweating and in her underwear sitting at their dining room table.\n\nIn a rage, he starts to tear through the apartment, searching every nook and cranny for his wife's lover. After checking everywhere and unable to find anyone, he decides to collect his thoughts on the balcony. \n\nUpon reaching the balcony, he is surprised to see two pairs of hands clutching the railing. He peers over to see a half-naked man, sweating and screaming for his life. \n\n\"Oh thank God! Help me!\"\n\nLosing his mind, he begins to pound on the man's hands screaming, \"You jerk! You've been sleeping with my wife.\"\n\nThe second man tries to hang on valiantly but after a few blows to the hands, he slips and plummets to the ground below, where he breaks both legs but is still alive. Still furious, the man who thought his wife was cheating on him, grabs the closest thing to him, a refrigerator, and using all his strength, forces it over the railing where it plummets toward the second man's broken body. Unfortunately...as the refrigerator goes over the railing, the power cord wraps around the first man's leg and pulls him over the railing as well. When he lands against the refrigerator, he breaks his back and he dies instantly. \n\nLater in heaven, the half-naked man (who was dangling from the railing) approaches St. Peter. St. Peter holds up and hand and says, \"We're currently filled to capacity. If you want to get into heaven, you need to have a truly tragic story.\"\n\nSo the half-naked man begins, \"There I was doing aerobics on my third-story balcony, when I lost my balance and fell over the railing. Luckily, I was able to grab onto the balcony below me. But then this mad man came out and started beating on my hands. I wasn't able to hold on and I fell to the ground below, breaking my legs. Then he pushed a refrigerator onto my face...and that's how I ended up here.\"\n\nDisgusted, St. Peter motions him into heaven, just in time for another man to walk up to him (The man who thought his wife was cheating on him.)\n\nWhen asked, he tells St. Peter, \"Well, I thought my wife was cheating on me and sure enough she was. I found him dangling from my balcony, so I beat on his hands until he fell and then I pushed a refrigerator onto his head. Unfortunately, the cord wrapped around my leg, and drug me to my death as well.\"\n\nSt Peter said, wow that is truly tragic. Please go into heaven. \n\nA third man walks up. Completely naked. \n\nSt. Peter says, \"I've heard two truly tragic stories in a row.

You'll have to go ask God.  He lives on top of that mountain over there.\" \n\nSo the zebra starts heading up the mountain and runs into an old man coming down. The zebra asks the old man, \"Are you God?\"  To which the old man replies, \"No, but is there something I can help you with?\" The zebra says, \"I'm trying to figure out if I'm black with white stripes or white with black stripes.\"  The old man says, \"That is a perfect question for God.  Let me know what he says.\" \n\nSo the zebra goes to the top of mountain and asks God, \"Am I black with white stripes or white with black stripes?\" God answers, \"You are what you are.\"  \n\nSo now the zebra is all sorts of confused, and he's thinking about this answer as he goes down the mountain, when he runs into the old man again, coming up.

They eat meats they never knew existed, drink wines they've never tasted, and feast on the sweetest desserts imaginable. The two feel more satisfied than they ever have in their lives, until the waiter brings the check...\n\n\"What are we going to do!?\" says the second. \"We can't pay for all of this!\"\n\n\"Trust me,\" says the first, as he pulls a long rubbery dildo out of his pocket. \"Get down on your knees, and suck the dildo.\"\n\n\"WHAT?!\" says the second. \"You're crazy!\"\n\n\"I'm serious!\" says the first. \"Get down on your knees and suck the dildo.

The dog is wearing an eye patch. The man says to the bartender, \"Ask me about my dog.\" Unfortunately, the bartender does not hear him, because he went deaf in one ear as a child. He serves a woman at the other end of the bar. When he comes around to the man with the dog again, the man orders an imported beer. He forgets what he was going to say about the dog.\n\n2. A priest, a rabbi, and a nonreligious person are flying across the Atlantic Ocean, all for different reasons. There is engine trouble, and one of the wings catches on fire. The plane starts to go down. Luckily, there are enough parachutes for everyone. Evacuation is orderly.\n\n3. An Irishman, an Englishman and an Indian chief go fishing together in a large rowboat in a medium-sized lake. Everyone has good luck: two or three big fish each. They stay out in the middle of the lake until sunset. On the way back to shore, as the sky purples and turns to night, they all sing a song.\n\n4. A duck goes into a pharmacy. He says to the pharmacist, \"I need some ointment for my beak. It is very chapped.\" The pharmacist says, \"We have nothing for ducks here.\"\n\n5. A dog goes into a bar. He is wearing an eye patch. The dog says to the bartender, \"Have you heard the one about the one-eyed dog?\" The bartender, who is deaf in one ear, thinks the dog is making fun of him. He asks him to leave. The dog says, \"Don't you have a sense of humor, deafie?\" At the end of his shift, the bartender is tired of all the jokes. Today it's a one-eyed dog. Yesterday it was a horse with rickets. The day before: ants. He lives above the bar in a small room. He spends the night alone there, listening to his battery-operated radio, which picks up only a bad jazz station.

        "body": "This was originally from the New Yorker:\n\n So a guy walks into a bar one day and he can\u2019t believe his eyes. There, in the corner, there\u2019s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.\n\nSo the guy asks the bartender, \u201cWhere\u2019d he come from?\u201d\n\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThere\u2019s a genie in the men\u2019s room who grants wishes.\u201d\n\nSo the guy runs into the men\u2019s room and, sure enough, there\u2019s this genie. And the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d So the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cO.K., I wish for world peace.\u201d And there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and then the room fills up with geese.\n\nSo the guy walks out of the men\u2019s room and he\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nSo the guy processes this. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cDoes that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cYeah. Why, what did you wish for?\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWorld peace.\u201d\n\nSo the bartender is understandably ashamed.\n\nAnd the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it\u2019s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI feel like I should explain myself further.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nBut the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.\n\nSo the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nAnd then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s just grab a beer. It\u2019s on me.\u201d",

The First Mate quickly retrieved the captain's red shirt and whilst wearing the bright red frock he led his men into battle and defeated the pirates.\n\nLater on that day, the look-out spotted not one, but two pirate ships. The captain again called for his red shirt and once again, though the fighting was fierce, he was victorious over the two ships. That evening, all the men sat around on the deck recounting the day's triumphs and one of the them asked the captain, ''Sir, why do you call for your red shirt before battle? The captain replied, ''If I am wounded in the attack, the shirt will not show my blood and thus, you men will continue to fight, unafraid.''\n\nAll of the men sat in silence and marveled at the courage of such a manly man as Captain Bravo. As dawn came the next morning, the look-out spotted not one, not two, but TEN pirates ships approaching from the far horizon. The crew stared at the captain and waited for his usual reply.\n\nCaptain Bravo calmly said, ''Hand me my brown pants.''",

Visit a sports physiotherapist if pain persists after two to three weeks.\n\nThe man went home quite impressed with this, the latest advancement in medical technology. Later that evening he began to wonder how the system worked, and decided that he would test the new computers capabilities. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, and urine samples from his wife and daughter and then masturbated into the concoction for added complexity.\nHe went back to the hospital\u2019s computer system and poured in his new sample.\nThe system made the usual noises and after a short pause printed out the message:\nYour tap water is too hard.

Walking down Dean Street he sees a lounge bar with a sign in the window 'Pianist wanted for evening performances'.  \n'Fucking get in there you cunt!' he says to himself and goes to the bar.   \n'Get the fucking manager of this pigs shit middle class wankhole please you cunt', he says to a somewhat startled barman.  \nThe barman however obliges and his manager comes upstairs.  \n'Can I help you sir?' he says.  \n'Yes you can you fat piece of shit, I saw your poxy advert in the cunting window and I'm here to audition.....wanker.'   \nThe manager is naturally put off by the man's abrasive manner but his dire need for a top class pianist forces him to agree to an audition. The first tune the Pianist plays is an uplifting jazzy number, not too involving, yet utterly melodic.  \nAt the end the thrilled barman cries, 'Wonderful, wonderful. What was that called?'   \n'That song, you big nosed twat, was called \"Excuse me prime minister but I just jizzed in your daughter's eye, and now the cunts blind...'   \n'Oh' says the manager 'err, can you play me another. Something a little less \"lively\".  \n'Wanker..' interjects the pianist before launching into a powerful ballad which leaves the manager in tears.  \nThe manager through his salty teardrops asks him the title.  \n'That little number was called \"Sometimes when you do a bird up the shitbox you get crap on your bell end.'  \n'I see' says the manager, 'Have you got any songs with less offensive titles?'  \n'Well there's my jazz number \"Do you want me to split your ringpiece\", or there's the epic \"I don't care if you're older my dear, you've still got nice jugs\".  \n'Look' says the manager interrupting, 'I think you're a superb pianist but the title of your songs are a little \"racy\". I will hire you on the condition that you do not introduce your songs or speak to the audience.'  \n'Fuck it' says the pianist 'Why not'.  \nOn his first night everything is going superbly the crowd are lapping up his repertoire and his silence is being perceived as modesty. The only thing putting off the pianist is that in the front row there is a gorgeous blonde in a black evening dress with a split up the side revealing the tops of her stockings, and a plunging neckline which boasts a proud and inviting cleavage.  \nDuring the interval the pianist has got such a stonking hard on that he decides to go to the bog and knock one out. Just as he has shot his muck he hears himself being re-introduced over the tannoy, so he rushes back to the stage and finishes his act.  \nAfter the show he is at the bar relaxing when the blonde approaches him.  \n'Hi' she says.  'Hello' he winces, struggling to hold in the expletives.  \nShe leans over and whispers in his ear, 'Do you know your cock is hanging out of your trousers, and spunk is dribbling onto your shoes?'  \n'Know it?' says the pianist putting his beer on the bar confidently, 'I fucking wrote it!!!'",

        "body": "So a guy walks into a bar one day and he can\u2019t believe his eyes. There, in the corner, there\u2019s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.\n\nSo the guy asks the bartender, \u201cWhere\u2019d he come from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThere\u2019s a genie in the men\u2019s room who grants wishes.\u201d\n\nSo the guy runs into the men\u2019s room and, sure enough, there\u2019s this genie. And the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d So the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cO.K., I wish for world peace.\u201d And there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and then the room fills up with geese.\n\nSo the guy walks out of the men\u2019s room and he\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nSo the guy processes this. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cDoes that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cYeah. Why, what did you wish for?\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWorld peace.\u201d\n\nSo the bartender is understandably ashamed.\n\nAnd the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it\u2019s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI feel like I should explain myself further.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nBut the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.\n\nSo the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nAnd then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s just grab a beer. It\u2019s on me.\n\n\nFrom :  www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/11/18/guy-walks-into-a-bar?src=mp",

What would you like for your birthday I will buy you a brand new Lambo or Porshce or whatever is cool nowadays and you can post it all over twittergram or whatever and be the coolest kid in school.  Instead the boy says nope I only want a pink ping pong ball.  The father insists that it is ridiculous but the kid really wants a pink ping pong ball so he went to the store and bought his son one.  The kid is so excited he takes it up to his room and sleeps with it but the next day the ping pong ball is gone.\n\nSo the next year the same procedure happens, the dad wants to get his son something really cool and the son simply asks for a box of pink ping pong balls.  The father still thinks it odd, but he goes to the store and buys a box of pink ping pong balls.  The same thing happened from last year, the son takes them to bed and in the morning they are nowhere to be found.\n\nThe next year the son is turning 18 and the dad has never been so excited.  He offers to buy the son anything he wants, after all he was graduating high school with honors, was accepted to college and overall was just an awesome son.  But still his kid insists that his father buy him a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.  The father has to ask, son what are you doing with these pink pong balls? The son is very embarrassed, his face turns red and he stutters dad....it's just personal....ok? The dad immediately regrets asking and apologizes profusely, proceeding to purchase a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.  The son rides his bike to the warehouse and spends the night there.  The next day when the son returns his dad gets a call, the workers at the warehouse were wondering where all of the pink ping pong balls went.  But the father was not going to ask again after already embarrassing his son once.\n\nWell the next year the son asks for a freighter full of pink ping pong balls.  The father anticipated this and without hesitating buys a ship full of pink ping pong balls and drops his son off at the port to spend the night.  When the dad picks him up the next morning he goes on the ship and realizes there is not one pink ping pong ball in sight.  On the way home from the port both father and son get in a terrible car accident and the son is rushed to the hospital.\n\nThe father feels so bad watching his kid suffer in emergency he asks if there is anything he can do to help and his son asked for 1 more box of pink ping pong balls to spend the night in the hospital with.  So the father bought the box for him and returned to the hospital the next morning.\n\nWhen the dad arrived, the doctors said his son had very little time left to live.  He enters the hospital room and notices the ping pong balls are gone.  After conversing a little he asks his son what he does with the pink ping pong balls because he just couldn't hold his curiosity any longer.\n\nThe son beckons his dad closer to the hospital bed and says \"I take them and then I\"\n\nBut then he died.\n\nTL:DR:There's no punch line.

There, in the corner, there\u2019s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.\n\nSo the guy asks the bartender, \u201cWhere\u2019d he come from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThere\u2019s a genie in the men\u2019s room who grants wishes.\u201d\n\nSo the guy runs into the men\u2019s room and, sure enough, there\u2019s this genie.

You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nSo the guy processes this. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cDoes that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cYeah. Why, what did you wish for?\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWorld peace.\u201d\n\nSo the bartender is understandably ashamed.\n\nAnd the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it\u2019s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI feel like I should explain myself further.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nBut the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.\n\nSo the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nAnd then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s just grab a beer.

Tell me, what did you do for a living?\"  The old man responds, \"I was a carpenter.\"  Jesus suddenly feels a pang of comprehension, but decides to question the old man further.  \"I see... and tell me, did you have any children... a son, perhaps?\"  At this, the old man excitedly replies, \"Oh yes, I had a son, but he was not my own... he was created by a higher power, and actually became quite famous, known throughout the world for his goodness and honesty.\"  At this, Jesus becomes quite emotional, and getting up, he embraces the old man and cries, \"Father!\"  And the old man, also emotional replies, \"Pinocchio!!\"",

There, in the corner, there\u2019s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.\n\nSo the guy asks the bartender, \u201cWhere\u2019d he come from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThere\u2019s a genie in the men\u2019s room who grants wishes.\u201d\n\nSo the guy runs into the men\u2019s room and, sure enough, there\u2019s this genie. And the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d So the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cO.K., I wish for world peace.\u201d And there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and then the room fills up with geese.\n\nSo the guy walks out of the men\u2019s room and he\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nSo the guy processes this. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cDoes that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cYeah. Why, what did you wish for?\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWorld peace.\u201d\n\nSo the bartender is understandably ashamed.\n\nAnd the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it\u2019s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI feel like I should explain myself further.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nBut the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.\n\nSo the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nAnd then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s just grab a beer.

Maybe no one is.\n\nLike you, certainly, I've heard all kinds of jokes about the Holocaust, September 11th, and recent mass shootings. I used to wonder why I never heard a good joke about [Jonestown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown) more than *three decades* after the fact, but then I realized that it was because the punchline was too long.",

There was Italian marble in the kitchen, Persian carpets in the living room that matched the mahogany bookshelves, and even a concert grand piano hand made in Germany.\n\nTo celebrate the completion of the project, he decided to throw an extravagant party with all his friends. There was food and drink in endless supply and excellent music and conversation all night.\n\nAs large parties tend to do, things got a little out of hand and one of the guests began dancing on the brand new piano. Tom was able to quickly get them down, but not before the delicate tuning was thrown off. Understandably upset, Tom despaired at the cost of re-tuning his prized piano.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" said one of his friends. \"I know a guy who will tune your piano for free. He's this old Greek guy by the name of Opernokite (Op-err-nock-it-ee), here's his card.\"\n\nOverjoyed, Tom calls Opernokite the next day and the tuner agrees to come see what he can do. That afternoon, the older gentleman arrives at Tom's house with his tools and with little preamble, begins working on the grand instrument. Within the hour he has the piano sounding as good if not better than before and, as advertised, charges nothing for his work.\n\nA couple weeks later, Tom decides to throw another huge party, and somehow the jerk who screwed up his piano before gets invited along again, whereupon he gets drunk, dances on the piano, and again throws it out of tune. \n\nThe next day, Tom calls the piano tuner to have him come back, but the old man refuses.\n\n\"Why?\" He asks, \"Is it money? I'll happily pay you.\"\n\n\"It's not that.\" The old man replies, \"Opernokite only tunes once.\"",

She went to the bookstore and bought every book she could find on ice fishing. \n\nFor weeks she read and studied, hoping to become an expert in the field. Finally she decided she knew enough and out she went for her first ice fishing trip. She carefully gathered up and packed all the tools and equipment needed for the excursion. Each piece of equipment had its own special place in her kit. \n\nWhen she got to the ice, she found a quiet little area, placed her padded stool and carefully laid out her tools. \n\nJust as she was about to make her first cut into the ice, a booming voice from the sky bellowed, \"There are no fish under the ice!!\" \n\nStartled, the blonde grabbed up all her belongings, moved further along the ice, poured some hot chocolate from her thermos, and started to cut a new hole. \n\nAgain the voice from above bellowed, \"There are no fish under the ice!!\" \n\nAmazed, the blonde was not quite sure what to do as this certainly was not covered in any of her books. She packed up her gear and moved to the far side of the ice. Once there, she stopped for a few moments to regain her calm. Then she was extremely careful to set everything up perfectly--tools in the right place, chair positioned just so. Just as she was about to cut this new hole, the voice came again. \n\n\"There are no fish under the ice!!\" \n\nPetrified, the blonde looked skyward and asked, \"Is that You, Lord?\" \n\nThe voice boomed back, \"NO THIS IS THE MANAGER OF THE SKATING RINK!\"  ",

Steve and his wife had sex every single night and had never been apart from one another since they tied the knot.  One evening though Steve came home from work and said \"Darling, I have some bad news. My company has ordered I go on a business trip for the next two months. I'm going to miss you dearly and I know you're going to miss me. Is there anything I can do for you before I leave?\" \"Well\" says Steve's wife \"you know how we have sex every single night?\" \"Yes I know dear.\" Said Steve. \"Well dear husband I want you to go out and buy me a dildo so I can have something to keep me company.\" \nSteve agrees and goes to the dildo shop. He looks around at all the dildos and sees big ones and small ones and ones with plugs and ones with sparkles. He approaches the shop keep and explains his predicament. \"Well that seems like a tall order,\" the shop keep says \"two months is a long time for a woman to stay faithful and a hard job for one dildo to do. But I think ive got just the thing.\" The shop keep reaches under his counter and pulls out a box. Steve opens the box to find what appears to be just an ordinary dildo. \"Whats so special about this one?\" Asks Steve. \"Watch this!\" Replies the shop keep \"I can command it. Voodoo Dildo! The door!\" And just then what seemed to be an ordinary dildo levitates from the box, travels to the door, and thunderously penetrates the keyhole. \"Remarkable!\" says Steve. \"Now watch this!\" says the shop keep \"Voodoo Dildo! The pocket pussies!\" And the Voodoo Dildo switches from the keyhole to fucking the pocket pussies on display in the store. \"Sensational!\" Says Steve. Finally the shop keep stops the Voodoo Dildo by saying \"Voodoo Dildo! Return!\" And the Voodoo Dildo levitated back to the box. Steve is very impressed by this magical sex toy and gladly purchases it from the store. \nSteve returns home with the box in hand eager to greet his wife and show off her new present. When he arrives he sees that she has gone to the grocery store. He leaves the package on their bed with instructions hes written on how to activate the Voodoo Dildo. \n\nLater in the evening Steve has gone to the airport and his wife has returned home. She spots the package left by her husband and without hesitation begins to open it. Inside she finds the Voodoo Dildo and Steves instructions. After reading the instructions she strips off all of her clothes and says \"Well I guess we should see what this is all about. Voodoo dildo! My pussy!\" And the Voodoo Dildo begins to give her the best she's ever had. It starts slow but eventually makes her come again and again. After her fourth orgasm she thinks shes had enough but oh no! Steve forgot to include how to make the Voodoo Dildo stop! She tries pulling it and grabbing it but it wont stop. She calls 911 but the operator tells her not to make prank calls on the emergency hotline. She rushes to find anything she can to stop it but it just wont. She climaxes again and finally decides to put on her clothes and drive to the hospital. Once shes in her car she can barely drive. Shes rushing to the hospital but is swerving and turning due to her reoccuring orgasms. A police cruiser notices this and pulls her over. She reluctantly pulls to the side of the road as she climaxes again. The cop asks her to roll down her window and she explains the whole story to the cop. After her long explanation and hurried story the skeptical policeman rolls his eyes, looks at her, and says \"Yeah right. Voodoo dildo my ass.\"",

He expected a car, since he was getting his license the next day, but the son said: \"Father, all I could want for my birthday is a pink ping-pong ball.\" The king thinks he's joking at first, but the son swears he wasn't. So the next day, the king granted his son the solitary pink ping-pong ball and the son took it with him to his room. He was in there for a few minutes, and after that, the pink ping-pong ball was never seen again. The king respected his son, so he didn't pry into his private life, but he was still very curious as to what the son did.\n\nThe night before the son's 17th birthday, the king asked his son what he wanted. The son said: \"Father, all I could want for my birthday is a 10-pack of pink ping-pong balls.\" The king is shocked again, but the next day the son got what he wished for, before going to his room for an hour with the pack. When he got out, the pink ping-pong balls were never seen again, and the king never asked where they went.\n\nThe night before the son's 18th birthday, the king asked his son what he wanted. The king was excited to buy him his own castle for him to live in, but instead the son said: \"Father, all I could want for my birthday is a crate full of pink ping-pong balls.\" The king, albeit disappointed, gives his son the crate of pink ping-pong balls the following day. The son went to his room for a few hours, and when he came out, the pink ping-pong balls were never seen again. The king didn't ask what he did with them.\n\nThe night before the son's 19th birthday, the king asked him what he wanted. He was expecting it by now. The son said: \"Father, all I could want for my birthday is a shack full of pink ping-pong balls.\" The next day, the son got his shack filled to the brim with pink ping-pong balls, and he disappears to his room for a full day. The pink ping-pong balls were never seen again. The king did not ask the son what he did with them.\n\nThe night before the son's 20th birthday, the king asked him what we wanted. The son said: \"Father, all I could ever want for my birthday is a ware-house full of pink ping-pong balls.\" The king, unsurprised, accepted. The next day, the son got his warehouse of pink ping-pong balls, and he stayed there for a few days. When he returned, not one pink ping-pong ball was ever seen again. The king fought his bursting curiosity and didn't question his son.\n\nHowever, the night before the son's 21st birthday, the prince got into a horrible car accident. He was in the hospital, on his death-bed, when his father visited him. \"Son,\" he said, \"this is going to be your last birthday for us together. Ask for anything, and you shall receive.\" The king was prepared to buy the son the moon and all of the stars if that's what he wanted, but instead the son croaked: \"Father... A-all I could want... Is... Is a pink... Ping... Pong... Ball...\" The king, with tears in his eyes, begged: \"My sweet son, my darling child, my first-born and only child... Forgive me for intruding on your privacy, but if I don't know, I will surely die of suspense. Son, why do you ask for pink ping-pong balls when you can have anything in the world? Why did you ask for more pink ping-pong balls every year? And what in God's name are you doing with them?\" The son opened his mouth to explain, but he knew he was too weak, so he whispered: \"I'll explain everything tomorrow when I have my energy, just get me the pink ping-pong ball.\" With that, the son passed out, and the king stayed with him all night.\n\nThe next morning, the king gave the son his pink ping-pong ball, then left him alone for a few minutes. When he came back, the pink ping-pong ball was gone. \"Son, now will you tell me your secret about your pink ping-pong balls?\" The son nodded. \"I shall tell you why I asked for pink ping-pong balls. I shall tell you why I asked for more every year. And I shall tell you what I did with them every year... Just... Lean closer...\" The king leaned forward and gave the son his ear. The son sat-up and croaked: \"I-\" he gasped for air, \"I-\" he gasped again, \"I-\" the son took his last breath and died.",

She is quite impressed by his sensitive side.\n\n\nBut, she doesn't mention this to him. \n\n\nThey share a bottle of wine and continue talking and, after awhile, she finds herself thinking, Oh my God!  Maybe, this guy could be the one! Just maybe, this could be the future father of my children.  She turns to him and kisses him lightly on the lips. He responds warmly and they continue to kiss, the passion builds, and he romantically lifts her in his arms and carries her into his bedroom where they rip off each other's clothes and make hot, steamy love.\n\n\nShe is so overwhelmed that she responds with more passion, more creativity, more heat than she has ever known.  After an intense, explosive night of raw passion with this sensitive guy, they are lying there together in the afterglow.\n\n\nThe woman rolls over, gently strokes his chest and asks coyly, 'Well, how was it?' \n\n\nThe guy gently smiles at her, strokes her cheek, looks deeply into her eyes, and says --  \n\n\n'Help yourself to any prize from the middle shelf.'",

Now there is this level 0 cheerio. Hes homeless, living out on the street, probably an alcoholic. But he falls in love with a frosted cheerio princess. So one day he sneaks into the royal gala and goes up to the princess and asks her \"will you marry me?\" Now she says \"I like your style, you're a good looking guy, a bit scruffy but I like you. Tell you what I will marry you if you can become a frosted cheerio\" So our guy goes back with a determination and gets a job and starts to pay off his debts. Now by having a job and his debts paid he becomes a level 1 cheerio. So he works, and he works, and he works, and he WORKS and he finally becomes a level 2 cheerio. Now he goes back to the princess and asks her again, \"will you marry me?\" she says \"no honey you really do have to become a frosted cheerio first.\" So he goes back and he works and works, hes a fryboy at McGrubers or something, I don't care. So he works and he works and he gets promoted at the restaurant and is making more money. And he works and he works and he works and by having that income raise he finally becomes a level 3 cheerio. He feels successful for the first time in his life but he is starting to fall back on his old ways. One day he goes to the casino and he loses and he loses and he loses and he gambled all his money away and he gets fired to boot because gambling is against company policy. So he is back down to a level 1 cheerio. He gets a job on a production line at a nearby factory and determines himself not to fall back ever again. So he works and he works and he works and he works and he WORKS, level 2, level 3, and he is doing great again. He is promoted to Floor manager of the factory and he is doing great and becomes a level 4 cheerio. But then one day a rival company sabotages their operation by putting poison in their toothpaste or whatever the hell they were making. They have to pay out damages and PR and the like and they declare bankruptcy. He is knocked back down to level 2 for the lack in income. But he is hired almost straight away by a branch of a huge conglomerate because they recognized how hard of a worker he is. So he works, level 3, works, level 4, and he works and works and WORKS. So he is promoted to CEO of the branch that he works in. A few months pass and he is approaching level 5 status when the Head of the entire conglomerate decides to retire. He weighs his options for his replacement and sees our guy and what a hard worker he is and chooses him as his replacement. So our guy is now the CEO of a huge company, a level 5 cheerio and making Bill Gates level money and he finally becomes a Frosted Cheerio. So he goes to the princess and asks her again, \"will you marry me?\" and she says \"Yes I will marry you now.\" So a few months pass and they're at the wedding reception, they already said their vows and the party is winding down. The newlywed wife tells her husband \"Hey I'm thirsty, can you go over to the bar and get me a Gin and Tonic or something?\" So the dutiful guy he is he went over to the bar and low and behold the bartender wasn't there. So he waits and he waits and he waits and he waits 15 minutes and the bartender still hadn't shown up so he decided he must have gone home since the party was winding down. So he went back to his wife and tells her the bartender wasn't there, can I get you something else? she replies: \"Ok, its fine. Here take this dollar and go buy me a Diet Coke at the vending machine in the lobby. So he goes to get it and there's a line for the machine. It was the princesses wedding so obviously a lot of people would show up. So he waits and he waits and he waits in line and he finally gets up to the machine only to find that the prices were hiked because they knew they could gouge them. So he goes back to his wife gets another dollar and waits and waits and WAITS in line only to find once he finally reached the front that they were out of Diet Coke. So he buys a regular Coke instead and takes it to his wife. She throws it away saying she needs to keep her figure yadda, yadda, yadda. So she tells him to get a cup off the table and get her some water from the cooler. So he goes over there and there is a line there too so he waits and he waits and he waits in line and the cooler runs out of water 5 people ahead of him. So exasperated he goes back to his wife and tells her, look there out of water is there any other source of liquid in this damn place. So she tells him \"screw it, just to go get some punch from the punch bowl.\" So he leaves, gets the punch, and comes back within a minute. She says \"wow, that was fast. What happened? How did you get it so fast?\" and he replies \"Well it was a short wait because there was no punchline.\"\n",

An absolutely voluptuous, gorgeous and scantily clad woman was sitting on a bean-bag made of bank bags filled with 100 dollar bills. \"Take me!\" She breathed huskily at him, \"Or climb the ladder for more.\" At this point he was dumbfounded, but he decided that if there's more after this, he's gotta take it. After all, he could always climb back down, right?\n\nAnd so the man climbs so fast that he can barely hold on to the bars. His libido and wallet-sense are going crazy, and he can't wait to see what lies upon the next cloud! The woman of his dreams, sitting upon solid gold bars? A harem of women, each wearing skirts and dresses made of checks for a million dollars? He can't wait.\n\nAnd it is in this state of mind that he reaches the top of the ladder. He jumps up to the clouds, expecting his dreams, and is thunderstruck. All that he can see is a big, 6'8\" butch-looking biker man. He looks behind him to see that he hasn't been tricked or anything, and notices that the ladder is also gone! \"What the hell's going on! Who're you?!\" he shouts at the man, half in rage and half in disappointed libido.\n\n\"I'm Cess.\" \n",

Of course I am a little nervous to meet her ripped, protective father towering over me.  She tells me not to worry.  I walk up to knock on the door to her family's house with a vase full of roses as a housewarming gift to break the ice.  The door opens and the dude looks like the fucking rock\u2026.but that's not all.  This guy is fully nude with his junk nearly at the same height as my face.  He looks at me and doesn't say a word for what felt like a minute.  He just looked down at me.  He finally said, \"You must be my daughter's man friend.  Come inside.\"  He had a heavy accent, and as i entered the house he followed me and kept on grunting like a fucking hog.  I walk past the living room which has a tannish carpet with red stains on it.  The only thing in the room was an old beat up couch and a tv the size of a microwave.  It was some Flintstone shit.  I walk into the kitchen and right away I want to vomit at the smell.  It smells like someone tried to microwave a bowl of diarrhea, and it exploded all over the room.  The source of the smell was coming from what looked like a bowl of fish heads.  These weren't any basic fish heads though.  They were fucking swordfish.  What I'm even more surprised to see is my girlfriend's old wrinkly mother walk into the kitchen with nothing but an apron covered in fish guts.  She saw me and immediately came over to greet me.  It was nasty and I could barely hold in the vomit.  She covered me in slimy fish guts as she hugged me and kissed me on the lips.  She tried to slip some tongue in and i had to back up.  It was one of the most uncomfortable situations in my life.  This house was a nightmare.  My girlfriend entered the room as my saving grace.  \"I see you've met my parents.  Let's go to the dinner table.\"  Before we could leave the kitchen her father yelled something in another language.  She sighed and stripped down until she was ass naked.  This was a pleasing sight because my gf is a ten.  We got to the table and I realized there was no silverware.  Her father came down and sat at the head of the table.  Her mother came in without the apron on and her saggy boobs were literally in the bowl of swordfish heads.  She came over and threw one down on my plate.  I looked at it in disgust.  My girlfriend whispered to me.  \"you have to get naked or my father will beat you with the paddle.\"  I looked at her like she was crazy.  \"hell no!\"  Surely enough, her father left the table and came back with a kayak oar.  I immediately started to get naked.  I was so uncomfortable with my genitals exposed on the cold hard chair.  Everyone all at once picked up their fish heads and started fucking attacking it like wild dogs.  They were just tearing through that shit.  I peeled of a few scales and took a small bite.  I couldn't swallow it.  I threw up on the plate.  Her father saw this and came back with the paddle.  I got up and ran for the door as he chased me.  I ran outside and the sun was still shining on our naked body's.  This guy was fast.  He caught up to me and picked me up by the armpits.  He ran with me in his arms all the way back to the house before a couple walking their dog saw me screaming in his arms.  They chased us and called the police.  Her father forced me to sit back down at the dinner table.  He ripped a chunk of the rish and started chewing it.  He pried open my mouth and spit the mush directly into my mouth.  My vomit was so strong that it hit him in the face and blinded him.  I ran for the door and my GF tackled me and pinned me down.  She was a strong mother fucker.  I heard sirens outside and the police kicked down the door.  Her father ran at an officer with the oar and they shot their tasers at him.  This did not stop him.  They drew out their pistols and started firing at him.  It took ten shots to kill the beast.  After a long interview at the police station, they gave me clothing and sent me home.

And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs.

I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.\n\nSo the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nAnd then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s just grab a beer. It\u2019s on me",

And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.\n\nSo the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nAnd then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s just grab a beer.

Billy Bob picks up a phone and calls some number. It's the senator's office. They chat for a while, Billy Bob asks how's the wife doing, senator invites himself to Billy Bob's next bbq, they have a laugh and then Billy Bob hangs up. The HR managers are looking a bit shocked but they says: \"You know, Billy Bob, alright, you know the senator. But really, who doesn't? At this time and age, knowing your senator isn't really that special. You would really have to have some higher up connections to get this job.\"\n\nBilly Bob replies: \"Well, I know Obama, does that help?\"\n\nThe managers think that it's bullshit and tell Billy Bob to prove it. He picks up the phone, calls the White House and is immediately transferred to Obama's office. They chat for a while, Billy Bob asks how's Michelle doing, Obama invites himself to Billy Bob's next bbq, they have a laugh and then Billy Bob hangs up. The managers can't believe what they just heard, but still say: \"You know, Billy Bob, alright, you know Obama. But really, who doesn't? At this time and age, knowing the president isn't really that special. We still can't give you the job. You would really have to have more connections than that...\"\n\nSo Billy Bob replies: \"I know the Pope. Does that help?\"\n\nThe managers call bullshit on Billy Bob and say that they really can't believe that. So to prove it, Billy Bob says, they should go to Vatican. They get on the first flight to Rome, get to Vatican, walk into St Peter's where the Pope is serving a mass, Billy Bob walks up to the Pope, just nonchalantly nodding to the guards, and they have a good chat, Billy Bob asks him how's God doing, Pope invites himself to Billy Bob's next bbq, they have a laugh and then Billy Bob says goodbye and walks back to the managers.\n\nThey have a look of total amazement on their faces, not being able to say a thing, so Billy Bob asks them: \"What? So I know the Pope. But really, who doesn't, right? At this time and age, knowing the Pope isn't really that special, is it?\" and the managers just shake their head: \"No, that's not it. When you were talking to the Pope, there were some Japanese tourists here, pointing at you, looking surprised, and then they asked: 'Who the hell is that old guy up there talking with Billy Bob?'\"",

I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him.

I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster.

I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.\n\nSo the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nAnd then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s just grab a beer. It\u2019s on me.\u201d",

But, I do know this witch who may be able to help you.\" So the doctor gives him directions to the witch.\n\n\nThe man calls upon the witch and relays his story. \"Witch, my penis is 25 inches long and I need help. Can anything be done to help me? You are my last hope!\" The witch stares in amazement, scratches her head, and then replies, \"I think I may be able to help you. Do this. Go deep into the forest. You will find a pond. In this pond, you will find a frog sitting on a log. This frog has magic. You say to frog, will you marry me? When the frog says no, you will find five inches less to your problem.\"\nThe man's face lit up and he dashed off into the forest. He called out to the frog, \"Will you marry me?\" \n\nThe frog looked at him dejectedly and replied, \"NO.\" The man looked down and suddenly his penis was 5 inches shorter. \"WOW,\" he screamed out loud, \"This is great!!\" But at 20 inches it was still too long, so he asked the frog again. \"Frog, will you marry me?\" the guy shouted. The frog rolled its eyes back in its head and screamed back, \"NO!\" The man felt another twitch in his penis, looked down, and it was another 5 inches shorter. The man laughed, \"This is fantastic.\" He looked down at his penis again, 15 inches long, and reflected for a moment Fifteen inches is still a monster, just a little less would be ideal.\n\n\nGrinning, he looked across the pond and yelled out, \"Frog will you marry me?\" The frog looked back across pond shaking its head, \"How many times do I have to tell you? NO, NO, NO!!\"",

There, in the corner, there\u2019s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.\n\nSo the guy asks the bartender, \u201cWhere\u2019d he come from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThere\u2019s a genie in the men\u2019s room who grants wishes.\u201d\n\nSo the guy runs into the men\u2019s room and, sure enough, there\u2019s this genie. And the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d So the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cO.K., I wish for world peace.\u201d And there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and then the room fills up with geese.\n\nSo the guy walks out of the men\u2019s room and he\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nSo the guy processes this. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cDoes that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cYeah. Why, what did you wish for?\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWorld peace.\u201d\n\nSo the bartender is understandably ashamed.\n\nAnd the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it\u2019s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI feel like I should explain myself further.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nBut the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.\n\nSo the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nAnd then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s just grab a beer. It\u2019s on me.\u201d \n\n[Source](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/11/18/guy-walks-into-a-bar)",

There\u2019s another hen beside him.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d she says pleasantly.  \u201cYou must be the new girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2026 I guess I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ll be happy here.  The henhouse is nice and warm, and the farmer is a kind man.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks nice,\u201d says Dave.  \u201cBut\u2026 I have the strangest feeling in the pit of my stomach.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that,\u201d says the other hen.  \u201cThat means you\u2019re about to lay an egg.  Surely you\u2019ve done that before.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I never have.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!  Well, it\u2019s very simple.  Just relax, put a bit of pressure down there, and squeeze.\u201d\n\nDave does as she says, and after a few seconds of straining, he feels an egg plop into the straw.\n\n\u201cI did it!\u201d he shouts.\n\n\u201cGood!  Simple, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2026 and I think there\u2019s another one coming!\u201d  Again he relaxes and squeezes, and another egg tumbles out.  All at once he\u2019s filled with a kind of ecstasy that touches the core of his being.  As a man, he never knew how it felt to bring new life into the world.  And now he does.  He feels a sense of oneness with all the other mothers of the world.  He\u2019s a giver of life!\n\n\u201cHere comes another one!\u201d he shouts joyfully.  And plop, he delivers another egg.\n\nSuddenly he feels someone shaking his arm.  \u201cDave!\u201d yells his wife.  \u201cDave, you idiot!  Wake up!  You just shit the bed!\u201d",

        "body": "So a guy walks into a bar one day and he can\u2019t believe his eyes. There, in the corner, there\u2019s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.\n\nSo the guy asks the bartender, \u201cWhere\u2019d he come from?\u201d\n\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThere\u2019s a genie in the men\u2019s room who grants wishes.\u201d\n\nSo the guy runs into the men\u2019s room and, sure enough, there\u2019s this genie. And the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d So the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cO.K., I wish for world peace.\u201d And there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and then the room fills up with geese.\n\nSo the guy walks out of the men\u2019s room and he\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nSo the guy processes this. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cDoes that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cYeah. Why, what did you wish for?\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWorld peace.\u201d\n\nSo the bartender is understandably ashamed.\n\nAnd the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it\u2019s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI feel like I should explain myself further.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nBut the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.\n\nSo the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nAnd then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s just grab a beer. It\u2019s on me.\u201d \n\n\n\n-Simon Rich\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/11/18/guy-walks-into-a-bar",

I read this in a bookstore having never read The New Yorker and was in total hysterics alone in the store.**\n\n\n\n\nSo a guy walks into a bar one day and he can\u2019t believe his eyes. There, in the corner, there\u2019s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.\n\nSo the guy asks the bartender, \u201cWhere\u2019d he come from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThere\u2019s a genie in the men\u2019s room who grants wishes.\u201d\n\nSo the guy runs into the men\u2019s room and, sure enough, there\u2019s this genie. And the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d So the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cO.K., I wish for world peace.\u201d And there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and then the room fills up with geese.\n\nSo the guy walks out of the men\u2019s room and he\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nSo the guy processes this. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cDoes that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cYeah. Why, what did you wish for?\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWorld peace.\u201d\n\nSo the bartender is understandably ashamed.\n\nAnd the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it\u2019s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI feel like I should explain myself further.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nBut the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.\n\nSo the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nAnd then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s just grab a beer. It\u2019s on me.\u201d ",

        "body": "I went to Home Depot recently while not being altogether sure that course of action was a wise one. You see, the previous evening I had prepared and consumed a massive quantity of my patented 'you're definitely going to poop yourself' road-kill chili. Tasty stuff, although hot to the point of being painful, which comes with a written guarantee from me that if you eat it, the next day both of your butt cheeks WILL fall off.. \n\n\n Here's the thing. I had awakened that morning, and even after two cups of coffee (and all of you know what I mean) nothing happened. No 'Watson's Movement. Despite the chillies swimming their way through my intestinal tract, I was unable to create the usual morning symphony referred to by my dear wife as 'thunder and lightning'. \n\n\n Knowing that a time of reckoning HAD to come, yet not sure of just when, I bravely set off for Home Depot, my quest being paint and supplies to refinish the deck.  Upon entering the store at first all seemed normal. I selected a cart and began pushing it about dropping items in for purchase.. It wasn't until I was at the opposite end of the store from the toilets that the pain hit me. \n\n\n Oh, don't look at me like you don't know what I'm talking about. I'm referring to that 'Uh, Oh, crap, gotta go' pain that always seems to hit us at the wrong time. The thing is, this pain was different. The chillies from the night before were staging a revolt.  In a mad rush for freedom they bullied their way through the small intestines, forcing their way into the large intestines, and before I could take one step in the direction of the toilets which would bring sweet relief, it happened. The chillies fired a warning shot. \n\n\n There I stood, alone in the paint and stain section, suddenly enveloped in a toxic cloud the likes of which has never before been recorded. I was afraid to move for fear that more of this vile odor might escape me.  Slowly, oh so slowly, the pressure seemed to leave the lower part of my body, and I began to move up the aisle and out of it, just as a red aproned clerk turned the corner and asked if I needed any help. \n\n\n  I don't know what made me do it, but I stopped to see what his reaction would be to the toxic non-visible fog that refused to dissipate.. Have you ever been torn in two different directions emotionally? Here's what I mean, and I'm sure some of you at least will be able to relate.  I could've warned that poor clerk, but didn't.. I simply watched as he walked into an invisible, and apparently indestructible, wall of odor so terrible that all he could do before gathering his senses and running, was to stand there blinking and waving his arms about his head as though trying to ward off angry bees. This, of course, made me feel terrible, but then made me laugh. .......BIG mistake!!!!! \n\n\n Here's the thing. When you laugh, it's hard to keep things 'clamped down', if you know what I mean. With each new guffaw an explosive issue burst forth from my nether region. Some were so loud and echoing that I was later told a few folks in other aisles had ducked, fearing that someone was robbing the store and firing off a shotgun.  Suddenly things were no longer funny.. 'It' was coming, and I raced off through the store towards the toilet, laying down a cloud the whole way, praying that I'd make it before the grand explosion took place. \n  Luck was on my side. Just in the nick of time I got to the john, began the inevitable floating above the toilet seat because my butt is burning SO BAD, purging. One poor fellow walked in while I was in the middle of what is the true meaning of 'Shock and Awe'.. He made a gagging sound, and disgustedly said, did it smell that bad when you ate it?', then quickly left. \n\n\n  Once finished and I left the restroom, reacquired my partially filled cart intending to carry on with my shopping when a store employee approached me and said, 'Sir, you might want to step outside for a few minutes. It appears some prankster set off a stink bomb in the store. The manager is going to run the vent fans on high for a minute or two which ought to take care of the problem.' \n\n\n  My smirking of course set me off again, causing residual gases to escape me. The employee took one sniff, jumped back pulling his shirt up to cover his nose and, pointing at me in an accusing manner shouted, 'IT'S YOU!', then ran off returning moments later with the manager. I was unceremoniously escorted from the premises and asked none too kindly not to return. \n\n\n  Home again without my supplies, I realized that there was nothing to eat but leftover chili, so I consumed two more bowls. The next day I went to shop at Lowes. I can't say anymore about that because we are in court over the whole matter. They claim they're going to have to repaint the store.",

'NEW Clitoris Licking Frog - Guaranteed satisfaction in minutes'.  \nIntrigued, Joan heads inside to enquire about the frog.  \n  \n\"Shopkeep\" says Joan \"Is that poster true? You guarantee this frog will bring me pleasure within minutes?\"  \n\"Why yes, madame.\" replies the shop keeper. \"This rare exotic frog will bring you quivering pleasure in wave after wave of ecstasy. Just take him home, take your clothes off, pop him on the bed in between your legs, and let the frog's tongue take care of things.\"  \nJoan quickly empties her purse onto the counter. The shopkeeper places a frog into a box and hands it to Joan who rushes off home to try out her new toy.  \n  \nNot wasting any time, Joan heads straight to the bedroom leaving a trail of her clothes behind her. Now spread on the bed, primed for a wild ride, she takes the frog out of the box and places it on the bed between her legs.  \nThe frog just stares at Joan with its bulging black eyes, not moving a muscle.  \n\"Well, go on. Get on with it then!\" bursts Joan, eager for the frog to do its thing.  \nBut again, the frog just stares, inflating its chest slightly before exhaling and then hopping right off the bed.  \nJoan was not pleased. In anger she scooped the frog back into the box and marched back down to the shop to demand her money back.  \n  \nAfter listening to Joan's complaint, the shopkeeper cleared his throat and offered his expert assistance. \"Madam, if I can get this frog to work for you, would you be willing to give it another try at home? If you still aren't satisfied I'll give your money back.\"  \nJoan nodded, after all she did so crave the satisfaction she'd not been able to achieve for years.  \n\"Then if you can make your way to the counter out back, remove your clothes and get into position, I shall join you in a moment\" said the shop keeper.  \n  \nJoan, now ready for the shop keeper, called him in.  \nThe clerk entered the room and placed the frog on the counter in between Joan's legs.

        "body": "(This is a joke to be told rather than read. With as big an audience as possible. Exaggerated actions and yarn-spinning positively encouraged.)\n\nA plane is downed in the Sahara desert. Five men survive the crash, stranded in the middle of the harsh and unforgiving dust of Northern Africa.\n\nThey have five bottles of water between them, and decide to try and walk towards civilisation. Weary, shaken and delirious, they set off on their journey.\n\nUp a sand dune, down a sand dune, up a sand dune, down a sand dune, up a sand dune, down a sand dune, over a bridge, clickety-click... up a sand dune, down a sand dune.\n\nAfter a few hours, one of the men drops to the ground. 'Lads', he croaks. 'I can't go on ... I'm just going to lay here. I'm exhausted. Let me die, save yourselves'.\n\nAfter much heart-rending deliberation, they agree. Their friend slips away in the heat. Heavy hearted, they decide to continue towards civilisation.\n\nUp a sand dune, down a sand dune, up a sand dune, down a sand dune, up a sand dune, down a sand dune, over a bridge, clickety-click... up a sand dune, down a sand dune.\n\nAnother one of the men keels over. 'I'm afraid I'm going the same way as poor Joe did back there ... you must carry on without me. You have wives and children! I am but a lonely old man. Please, let me die'.\n\nThe three remaining travellers think about this -they are getting desperate, so they let Philip pass away under the midday heat, and continue.\n\nUp a sand dune, down a sand dune, up a sand dune, down a sand dune, up a sand dune, down a sand dune, over a bridge, clickety-click... up a sand dune, down a sand dune.\n\nShortly afterwards, they stumble across an oasis. Overjoyed, they fill up their bottles and drink as much as they can physically keep down, before setting off again. The three men left have five bottles of water between them now and are filled with renewed hope of finding a village, a town, anything before the Sahara swallows them up. They walk on.\n\nUp a sand dune, down a sand dune, up a sand dune, down a sand dune, up a sand dune, down a sand dune, over a bridge, clickety-click... up a sand dune, down a sand dune.\n\nSuddenly, young Timmy, barely 18 years old, tumbles to his knees. He doesn't even speak. The two men left go over to him and check for a pulse ... but he's dead. The life sucked out of him by the merciless beat of the afternoon sunshine.\n\nThis leaves James and Terrence. James, a marathon runner and the fitter of the two has an idea.\n\n'I'll go back to the oasis. We'll have five bottles of water between the two of us. I will go as quick as I can. That should give us enough water to get back to civilisation and save ourselves! We can't be far away now.'\n\nReluctantly, Terrence agrees. He finds shade behind a boulder and watches as James disappears over the horizon in search of water.\n\nUp a sand dune, down a sand dune, up a sand dune, down a sand dune, up a sand dune, down a sand dune, over a bridge, clickety-click... up a sand dune, down a sand dune.\n\nJames gets to the oasis, fills up the bottles of water, hoists them onto his back and sets off again as the light starts to fade.\n\nUp a sand dune, down a sand dune, up a sand dune, down a sand dune, up a sand dune, down a sand dune, over a bridge, clickety-click... up a sand dune, down a sand dune.\n\nIt is dusk as Terrence sees James coming over the dunes. He looks like a shell of a man, weak and broken. He's already drunk half the water and looks more dead than alive.\n\n'Terrence...go....you..have..a..good..chance.... I have done my part... I will only..slow you.....down', chokes James. Terrence watches as his saviour's eyes flicker closed and the light of life drains out of them, just like that.\n\nTerrence takes the remaining bottles of water, and does the only thing he can do.. keeps walking.\n\nUp a sand dune, down a sand dune, up a sand dune, down a sand dune, up a sand dune, down a sand dune, over a bridge, clickety-click... up a sand dune, down a sand dune.\n\nHe sees lights on the horizon. It can't be! A city! James races onwards.\n\nUp a sand dune, down a sand dune, up a sand dune, down a sand dune, up a sand dune, down a sand dune, over a bridge, clickety-click... up a sand dune, down a sand dune.\n\nUp a sand dune, down a sand dune, up a sand dune, down a sand dune, up a sand dune, down a sand dune, over a bridge, clickety-click... up a sand dune, down a sand dune.\n\nApproaching what looks to be a sprawling city, James comes to a huge bridge. An old man stands on the bridge, holding a candle. He says to James before he can react:\n\n'This candle has been burning for over A THOUSAND YEARS!'\n\nJames says, **PUFF** 'Not anymore!'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n^I'm^so^sorry",

Your line is easy. All you have to say is 'Hark! Are those canons I hear?'  Think you can handle that, Charlie?\"    \n\nCharlie was ecstatic. \"Yeah! I can do it! 'Hark, are those cannons I hear?' Easy! When do I gotta be there?!\"     \n\n\"Tonight at 7pm the curtain goes up, Charlie.  Don't blow this! It's your big break!\"      \n\nSo Charlie started practicing right away...  \"Hark! Are those cannons I hear?\" he said has he showered. \"HARK! Are those cannons I hear?\" he said as he shaved.

ARE THOSE CANNONS I HEAR?!\" Through his afternoon nap, he mumbled to himself: \"Hark, are those cannons I hear...\"     \n\nAnd, of course, he overslept.  His phone rang at 7:45pm. His agent. \"Charlie! Where the hell are you? You're on stage in thirty minutes! Get the fuck down there!\"  Charlie clambered out of bed... \"What was my line again? oh yeah; Hark! Are those cannons I hear?\"  He hailed a cab; \"Hark! Are those cannons I hear?\"  All the way to the theater; \"HARK! Are those cannons I hear? Hark; are those CANNONS I HEAR!?\"     \n\nAs he ran through the stage door, the director caught him; \"Charlie! You're on in two minutes! Get your costume on! What's your line? Do you remember your fucking line?!\"    \n\"Yeah, it's 'HARK! Are those cannons I hear?\"     \n\"Great!

We did it with a full battalion but our casualties are at 4 out of all that were sent in, none of them suffered life threatening injuries. On the first day of the Operation we went in with an offer to assist the tenants in moving out, but with the firm message that it was a necessary acquisition that was going to happen either the easy way or the hard way. Some accepted our offer and we assisted them in leaving and relocating, but others stayed. The next day, we did have to go through the eviction process and things did get rough. but the building is ours with some damage and mild resistance.\"\n\nEach unit nodded their assent and the officer in charge the the seals chose to go next.\n\n\"Well our mission was over much quicker and cleaner than the Marines, no hard feelings guys. and we only suffered one casualty out of the twelve seals, but she will make it. We went in on the first day, and as the same with the marines and quite a few people laughed. Over the next few days we went in at night quick and quiet and 'extracted' as many as we could each night until the rest either left or were removed. The building is ours with only minimal damage.\" \n\nAfter a few nods of acknowledgement the Officer for the seals sat down pretty smugly. Then the officer for the Air Force division got up and went on with the briefing.\n\n\"Well um.. our operation was finished on the first day.\" this got a few eyebrows from the marine and Seals officers. \"and out of our team of four, we are glad to say that no one was harmed.\"\n\n\"What did you do, bomb the building with a UAV?\" asked a marine officer.\n\n\"No, part of the requirement was to keep collateral damage to a minimum. And before you say anything else, no ordinance was fired, there were no casualties on both sides, and there was no damage to the building\" This got dead silence from the room at large. \"And they did accept our first offer\" the Air force officer finished with.\n\n\"What was your offer\" The seals officer asked now taking it seriously.

        "body": "Old, long winded, and immature. But, I always laugh at it\n\nThree farmers had been competing at the state fair for several years now for the biggest pig contest. Each year though all three farmers would lose to a pig from another county. So, Farmer John calls farmer Brown and Farmer Dan over to his house one day. Farmer John had the idea that the reason each one of them lost separately was because neither of them had a farm with enough food to feed their respective pigs, so the animals never grew big enough. He set down the idea that the three of them pull their resources and enter next year\u2019s contest together with a single pig. All agreed.\n\nAnd so, Farmer Brown, Dan, and John raised a single piglet to a good sized hog, but upon seeing what the other state\u2019s farmers were raising the were dismayed by the fact that their pig just wasn\u2019t big enough.\n\n\u201cI have an idea\u201d Farmer Brown said. \u201cThis pig shits too much, let\u2019s put a plug in his ass to keep him from shitting, and that ought to make him nice and fat.\u201d They all agreed\n\nAnd so, the pig with a plug in his ass got nice and fat, fatter than any other pig in the state. So fat in fact he was a fair record breaker. The three farmers went home, glade to each have been given a blue ribbon for raising such a prize worthy pig. The time then came then that the pig had to go to slaughter, but before they could do that the farmers had to remove the plug in his ass.\n\n\u201cWell I ain\u2019t doin\u2019 it.\u201d Farmer Brown said. \u201cThat pig is HUGE, big as a shed, and all that shit in there? Nu-uh. Not happening. Sides, it was my idea to put the plug there, one of you do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDun look at me, I\u2019s the one that pulled the pig on my trailer. You do it.\u201d Farmer John quarreled.\n\n\u201cWait fellahs,\u201d Farmer John interrupted. \u201cWe got this far without fighting, let\u2019s not start now. I have an idea. I got a monkey. He\u2019ll do anything for a peanut. If I give him a peanut, I reckon I can get him to pull the plug out for us.\u201d They all agreed. Farmer John left to get his monkey and a bag of peanuts. When he came back he put the monkey down and held out a peanut for him. \u201cAll right Bo-bo. Go get the-\u201c\n\n\u201cHold on!\u201d farmer Brown said, stepping forward and holding back John\u2019s hand. \u201cNot here. If that pigs gon\u2019 shit let it be in the field. Yuh know, free fertilizer.\u201d\n\nJohn nodded and they all headed out to Brown\u2019s field. John stood the closest, with Brown about half way between the pig and the edge of the field, and Dan standing at its edge. When Farmer John sent his monkey Bo-bo to pull the plug there was a great resounding, long, wet fart followed by a great black-brown foul smelling torrent of pig shit that rose up to Dan\u2019s ankles. Brown was up to his hips in pig leavings, and John? John was up to his neck, laughing.\n\nDan and Brown were rightly and reasonably mad, both cursing up storm until their saw Farmer John laughing. \u201cWhat the hell you laughing for?\u201d Shouted Dan, trying to shake the stink off his legs.\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re up to your neck in filth\u201d Added Brown\n\nBetween alternating gasps and gags John looked back at the other two. \u201cYou should have seen that monkey trying to put that plug back!\u201d",

Absolutely anything at all. Keep in mind you'll be getting your driver's license very soon! So, what would you like? Anything at all!\" and the kid says \"A pink ping pong ball!\" so the dad just explodes \"DAMMIT SON, I'VE TOLD YOU NO EVERY SINGLE YEAR. IT'S STUPID, IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, THERE IS NO REASON YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASKING ME FOR A PINK PING PONG BALL EVERY YEAR FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY SINCE YOU WERE OLD ENOUGH TO SPEAK. ENOUGH OF THIS SHIT.\" so he goes out and buys his son a brand new Lexus convertible.\n\n\nA few weeks later, the son was in a horrible car accident and was in the ICU. The father rushed to the hospital to be at his son's side. The doctors informed him that his son might not make it. With tears in his eyes, he holds his son's hand and says \"I always tried to be a good father, and you were the perfect son. Is there anything at all I can do to make you more comfortable? Would you like for me to bring you anything from home? Anything at all?\" and his son looks up at him and says \"I.. I'd like a pink ping pong ball..\"\n\n\nDad stands up and says \"A pink ping pong ball.. Alright son.

He had many chickens that needed servicing to make new baby chickens. So the farmer shows up at his neighbors house and asks if he has any roosters  to sell. The neighbor says that he only has one for sale but it will take care of all the farmers needs. The farmer tells his neighbor that the. The neighbor assures the farmer that this one rooster will do the trick. So with no other option farmer agrees to buy the rooster. The neighbor whistles and the scrawniest, ugliest, rooster you have ever seen walks up to them. This rooster has about 4  feathers total, is missing an eye and looks like he's about to die. The farmer reluctantly picks up this poor excuse for a rooster and takes him home. He sets the rooster by the hen coop and says \"well rooster do your thing\". At that the rooster takes off like a bolt of lighting, feathers are flying out of the coop's window, hens are going crazy and bam, bam, bam the rooster services 500 hens in about 15 minutes. Impressed the farmer heads back to tend to his other chores. Later that afternoon as the farmer is haying a field he sees the rooster swimming in the pond and BAM BAM BAM that rooster services all the ducks in the pond. Wow the farmer thinks what a great rooster. Later that evening as the farmer is sitting on the porch he notices the pheasants in his field are going crazy. Next thing you know he sees the rooster jump in the air catching pheasant after pheasant and taking them right there on the ground. THIS ROOSTER IS AMAZING the farmer things to himself. Impressed with his purchase the farmer goes to bed and sleeps better than he has in ages. The next morning the farmer gets up, makes his morning coffee, and heads out to check on his hens. Low and behold the rooster is laying in the middle of the yard, buzzards circling over head, dead as a door nail. The farmer begins to wail \" YOU WERE THE BEST ROOSTER EVER WHY, WHY GOD DID YOU HAVE TO DIE\" the farmer approaches the roosters corpse and gently puts the roosters head in his lap and begins to cry uncontrollably. Just then the rooster's eye pops open and with a featherless wing he points to the sky and wispers \" Shhhhh they're getting closer!",

My prospective sister-in-law was twenty years of age, wore tight mini skirts and low cut blouses. She would regularly bend down when near me and I got many a pleasant view of her underwear. It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was near anyone else. \n\nOne day her little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived.

She said, \"I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me.\" I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house. I walked straight towards my car. My future father-in-law was standing outside.

        "body": "Once upon a time, there were three kingdoms, all bordering on the same lake. For centuries, these three kingdoms had fought over an island centered at the middle of the lake. Over the years, the kingdoms had shed much blood and made many sacrifices in order to have control over the immense beauty and bountiful resources inherent in the small island; however no kingdom has managed to gain complete control over the land for very long.\n\nThese kingdoms had resorted to praying to their own deities and angels to gain advantage in their battles, creating pendants and standards for their soldiers to carry. The trinkets were so absurd that it got to the point where even the standards had complementary standards to go along with them. The religion itself was also absurd, the kingdoms had three deities: the Northern, more opulent kingdom worshiped the angel of the right hand; the Western kingdom worshiped the angel of the shoulders; finally, the southern, most impoverished kingdom worshiped the angels of the left thigh. Despite the absurdity, the religiosity did seem to give some advantages to the knights and squires.\n\nAfter many bloody years, a spirit from the forest to the East came in the form of a deer (or maybe it was a tree) who also, peculiarly enough, made delicious baked pastries. He gave unto the three kingdoms some wisdom and his best judgement. He presented a solution, that if the three kingdoms were to have one large, final,\nglorious battle, then the winner should be granted undisputed control over the central island. After some discussion between the three kingdoms, it was decided that the ultimate battle will take place the following day. Before they went their separate ways, they asked the forest spirit which kingdom he believed would be victorious. He conjectured that there would be a victor as long as the proper archangel was worshiped because then the victor will win regardless; \notherwise, as long as the religious artifacts of the most deserving side are not stolen, then they will win.\n\nWith that, the kingdoms sent their knights and squires to the island to prepare for the battle that will ensue the following day. The northern kingdom, being quite rich, sent an army of 25 knights, each with 24 squires and 7 bottles of wine. That night, the knights cavorted and jousted as their squires polished their armor, cooked their food, and sharpened their weapons. They brought an altarpiece and many relics to worship their angel. The western kingdom, being less well off than the northern, sent 13 knights each with 12 squires and 5 bottles of wine. That night, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires cooked their food and polished their armor. They could only bring a few icons that they shared amongst themselves. The southern kingdom, being very poor, only sent one elderly knight and his own son as his squire. The knight\npolished his armor and sharpened his weapons as the squire prepared to make his soup by tying a looped rope around the cauldron and hanging it high above the fire. They had only brought a single piece of a co-part standard, only having half of the total set. Every soldier was praying to their respective archangels, hoping that they were praying to the right ones. \n\nThe following day, the knights from the first two kingdoms were too tired to fight (as they had cavorted a bit too much). The squire from the third kingdom could not awake his elderly father either. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires decided to fight themselves. The battle raged for many hours and many had sought to steal the relics each side had of their respective religions in order to gain the upper hand as prophesied by the forest spirit.\n\nMeanwhile, the people of the three kingdoms were all waiting in the forest, watching the battle beyond the water that separated them. As night approached, the victors had not yet been spotted. As they waited, a single boat approached them which harbored who they asserted was the last remaining soldier of the battle. In a surprising turn of events, it was the squire from the Southern kingdom! All he had with him was a lantern, his father's sword, and the half of the co-standard he carried to battle. \n\nAfter the commotion settled down, the forest spirit came again, presenting them all with some baked pastries and spoke some more wisdom with the squire. The squire was eventually given the throne of the southern kingdom, and was asked how he accomplished this feat of excellence. \n\n\"As a surprise, we were not worshiping the correct angel. The Pie Stag (or Treant) Theorem states that for the right thigh angels, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides. However, in this case, the other sides were missing the co-sign of this squire's corresponding angel.\"",

His Uncle John would bounce him on his knee as a child and tell him stories about steam engines and the old days of the railroad.\n\nMatt loved trains so much that he went to the Harvard School of Trains. He graduated as the valedictorian of his class and was the hottest candidate for top train conducting positions at every major rail company in the United States.\n\nAfter graduating college, Matt earned a job in California as a train conductor near Los Angeles.\n\nAfter a successful year on the job, Matt was conducting a train one day and noticed a group of surfer dudes on the tracks. Matt *hated* surfer dudes with every fiber of his being. At night he would dream of strangling surfer dudes to death with his bare hands until they were all but eradicated from the world.\n\nMatt knew the right thing to do was to stop the train and wait for the surfer dudes to move off the tracks. He had enough distance to stop. But he hated the surfer dudes so much that he kept going, full speed. He hit the surfer dudes and killed them all. Their families were devastated.\n\nPolice arrested Matt as soon as he reached Beverly Hills railroad station. He was put on trial for murder and found guilty. The executioner allowed him one last meal. Matt asked for a silver banana.\n\n**\"Where the hell can I find a silver banana?\"** The executioner asked, agitated that Matt would ask for such an unusual item.\n\nMatt explained, **\"You can find a silver banana at the top of Mt. Everest. But be careful, the banana is guarded by rabid killer mountain goats.\"**\n\nThe executioner sighed and reluctantly complied with Matt's request. Using taxpayer dollars, the LA Police Dept. sent a team of mountain climbers up to Mt. Everest, led by the king of mountain climbing Reinhold Messner himself. Sure enough, a silver banana sat atop a pedestal at the peak of the mountain, guarded by seemingly docile mountain goats.\n\nThe rookie of the mountain climbing group says, **\"Ha. Stupid goats. They can't hurt us at all. They're not even doing anything to us.\"** He grabbed the silver banana off the pedestal, and the goats go berserk. Every member of the group was brutally killed and dismembered by these mountain goats except for Reinhold Messner, who managed to crawl back to Los Angeles. With his dying breath, he says **\"Here is the silver banana,\"** hands it to the executioner, and dies. A massive outpouring of grief from the mountain climbing community ensued, many candlelight vigils were held, and the funeral service was televised by all major global television broadcasting companies.\n\nMatt's execution day finally arrives and the executioner hands him the silver banana. Matt eats it and sits in the electric chair. The executioner straps him in, flips the switch, and Matt survives. According to the law at the time, Matt was now free to go. The executioner was furious but had no choice but to let Matt walk.\n\nSince Matt was banned from working on any California railroad, he moved up north to Seattle, in hopes of starting a new life. He got a job near Seattle as a train conductor and was able to convince the hiring manager that he was reformed and would not slip up again.\n\nAfter a successful year on the job, Matt was conducting a train one day and noticed a group of hipsters on the tracks. Matt *hated* hipsters with every fiber of his being. At night he would dream of strangling hipsters to death with his bare hands until they were all but eradicated from the world.\n\nMatt knew the right thing to do was to stop the train and wait for the hipsters to move off the tracks. He had enough distance to stop. But he hated the hipsters so much that he kept going, full speed. He hit the hipsters and killed them all. Their families were devastated.\n\nPolice arrested Matt as soon as he reached the Space Needle railroad station. He was put on trial for murder and found guilty. As it turns out, the executioner from Los Angeles had moved back to Seattle in order to be closer with his loved ones. Bewildered, shocked, and angry, the executioner allowed him one last meal. Matt asked for a silver banana.\n\n**\"Another silver banana? Where the hell can I find a silver banana? At the top of Mt. Everest again?\"** The executioner asked, exasperated and flabbergasted.\n\nMatt explained, **\"No, you can find a silver banana at the core of the Yellowstone National Park volcano. But be careful, the banana is guarded by rabid killer bison.\"**\n\nThe executioner sighed and reluctantly complied with Matt's request. Using taxpayer dollars, the Seattle Police Dept. sent a team of volcanologists to explore the inside of the Yellowstone volcano, led by the king of volcanology Kenneth Hon himself. Sure enough, a silver banana sat atop a pedestal at the very center of the volcano, guarded by seemingly docile (and temperature-resistant) bison.\n\nThe rookie of the volcanologist group says, **\"Ha. Stupid bison. They can't hurt us at all. They're not even doing anything to us.\"** He grabbed the silver banana off the pedestal, and the bison go berserk. Every member of the group was brutally killed and dismembered by these bison except for Kenneth Hon, who managed to crawl back to Seattle.

He got a job near Z\u00fcrich as a train conductor and was able to convince the hiring manager that he was reformed and would not slip up again.\n\nAfter a successful year on the job, Matt was conducting a train one day and noticed a group of yodelers on the tracks.

Bewildered, shocked, and angry, the executioner allowed him one last meal. Matt asked for a silver banana.\n\n**\"NOOOOOOOO! Another silver banana?! Where the hell can I find a silver banana? At the top of Mt. Everest again? Maybe at the center of a volcano this time?!\"** The executioner asked, exasperated and flabbergasted.\n\nMatt explained, **\"No, you can find a silver banana on Mars. But be careful, the banana is guarded by rabid killer Martians.\"**\n\nThe executioner sighed and reluctantly complied with Matt's request. Using taxpayer dollars, the Z\u00fcrich Police Dept. sent a team of astronauts to explore Mars, led by the king of space exploration Neil Armstrong himself. Sure enough, a silver banana sat atop a pedestal at the very top of Mars, guarded by seemingly docile Martians.\n\nThe rookie of the astronaut group says, **\"Ha. Stupid Martians.

I had had this feeling for a long time, that my wife is cheating on me. Thus I decided to go early home from work to check on the situation because I had a feeling something fishy might be going on. When I got home, I saw another man's clothes on the floor of the hallway. So I went to the bedroom where my wife was naked and sobbing and making excuses but I was just furious and wanted to find the guy. Watched under the bed and in the closet and then it hit me.. THE BALCONY! So I went there and he was hanging from the railing. Frustrated, I started hitting his hands so the bastard would fall off. It was the third floor of a tower block so he would fall pretty badly. The F*cker held really nicely onto the railing, so I decided to get a hammer. Couple of nice hits and the guy was lying on the ground, but I was so damn frustrated that I threw him with our freezer and snapped my back while doing it. So that's how I died.\"\n\nJohn loked at the man and nodded. Then went to the second guy.\nThe 2nd man then started:\"Well, I was cleaning my house, all over everywhere. It was a beautiful day and because I live on the fourth floor I decided to enjoy it and leave washing the windows last. So while I was doing it, I slipped on the soap and started falling, but thank God I got to hang on the railing. My hands stretched a bit and I had a hard time getting up. Suddenly some guy came from the apartment and started beating my hands. I tried to tell him to stop but he didn't listen. I barely managed to hold on but then the maniac took A HAMMER. It hurt like hell and I had to let go. I fell to the ground and I got in so much pain that i had probably few of my ribs broken. I hoped that someone could call an ambulance but before anything else could happen, I saw a fridge or freezer or something flying towards me from the third floor. Aaaaand that's how I got here then.\"\n\nSaint John had a surprised look when the man finished. But he had to let the third man tell his story so he started: \"Well..

        "body": "So, there's a man crawling through the desert.\nHe'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.\nHe stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.\nHe thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So, he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the direction he thinks is right.\nHe walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.\nHe pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.\nBy the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.\nAs it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things, he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.\nFull dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.\nHe wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.\nHe knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.\nHe rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.\nThen he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.\nLooking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.\nAs he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.\nHe decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle. He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to make some difference and keep himself from passing out.\nHe's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him, it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.\nHe walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills, dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water. Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.\nAfter a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.\nAfter more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it, trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.\nHe was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.\nHe walks through the sand.\nAfter a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.\nBut, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.\nHalfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.\nWhile crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape - shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.\nHe finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top, he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.\nAgain, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from here. He's going to have to go down there and look.\nHe puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune. After a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.\nHe stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.\nSo, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last chance.\nHe gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just keeps crawling.\nFinally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center, where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone area.\nHis mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun overhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying down on the nice cool surface.\nCool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him a drink. Then he'll know he's gone.\nHe decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the center before he goes. He keeps crawling.\nIt's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's hearing. He would swear that someone just said, \"Greetings, traveler. You do not look well. Do you hear me?\"\nHe stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and knees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something different - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands and tries again. Better this time.\nYep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet out of the stone, at an angle.\nAnd wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.\nHe stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to move from this spot.\nWell, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.\nHmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet - that was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.\nHe then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here because he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was likely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was now on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake was even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.\nHe tries to clear his throat to say, \"Hello,\" but his throat is too dry. All that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out, almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't good. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes out.\nHe gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips, and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk now.\nHe tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to spot the owner of this place, and croaks out, \"Hello? Is there anyone here?\"\nHe hears, from his side, \"Greetings. What is it that you want?\"\nHe turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides to try asking for help.\n\"Please,\" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, \"I'd love to not be thirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?\"\nLooking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its mouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he falls forward, face first on the stone, \"Very well. Coming up.\"\nA piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped around the tilted white post, still looking at him.\nHe reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet. He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes - they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been bitten. By the snake.\n\"It'll feel better in a minute.\" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more importantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!\n\"Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the afterlife?\"\n\"Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,\" says the snake. \"That's the way I work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.\"\n\"You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be thirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk? Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?\"\n\"No,\" says the snake, \"I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just sitting around here.\"\nThe man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer dying of thirst.\n\"I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your system with the next request,\" continued the snake. \"I can guess why you drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or two, if you drank enough of it.\"\n\"Ummm, n-next request?\" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.\n\"That's the way it works. If you like, that is,\" explained the snake. \"You get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish.\" The snake grinned at his own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.\n\"But there are rules,\" the snake continued. \"The first request is free. The second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of responsibility.\" The snake looks at the man seriously.\n\"By the way,\" the snake says suddenly, \"my name is Nathan. Old Nathan, Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound used to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into names. You can call me Nate, if you wish.\" Again, the snake grinned. \"Sorry if I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds somewhat threatening.\" The snake give his rattle a little shake.\n\"Umm, my name is Jack,\" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. \"Jack Samson.\n\"Can I ask you a question?\" Jack says suddenly. \"What happened to the poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that? What do you mean by that's how you work?\"\n\"That's more than one question,\" grins Nate. \"But I'll still try to answer all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question.\" The snake's grin gets wider. \"Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need to drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not be thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert. You've been changed.\n\"For the third question,\" Nate continues, \"you are still dying. Besides the effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal. In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years. Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is.\" Nate seemed vastly amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.\n\"As for the fourth question,\" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, \"first you have to agree to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell you.\"\n\"Wait,\" joked Jack, \"isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd have to kill me?\"\n\"I thought that was implied.\" Nate continued to look serious.\n\"Ummm...yeah.\" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was talking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a nasty temper. \"So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really stop the effects of the methanol?\" Jack thought for a second. \"And, what do you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper fluid, and just denature it?\"\n\"They may, I don't really know,\" said Nate. \"I haven't gotten out in a while. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and on that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you pulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume that they still color wiper fluid blue?\"\n\"Yeah, they do,\" said Jack.\n\"I figured,\" replied Nate. \"As for being bound by secrecy - with the fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me, this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me, write about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will lead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding anyway, so you won't notice.\" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.\nJack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a little nervous at this. \"Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?\"\nWell, Jack,\" said Nate sadly, \"I can't tell you that, unless you make the second request.\" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.\n\"Umm, well, ok,\" said Jack, \"what is this about a second request? What can I ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?\"\n\"Sure!\" said Nate, brightening. \"You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes to yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and before you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or omnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous and yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and sort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be omniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very useful, at least in my opinion.\" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was staring at him.\n\"Well, anyway,\" continued Nate, \"I'd probably suggest giving you permanent good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long time, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to recover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a request to me.\"\n\"Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?\" said Jack. \"And keep me healthy for a long time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request about a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not really a change to me?\"\n\"Right,\" nodded Nate.\n\"Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?\" Jack asked, hopefully.\n\"That takes two requests, Jack.\"\n\"Yeah, I figured so,\" said Jack. \"But I could ask to be a genius? I could become the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?\"\n\"Well, I could make you very smart,\" admitted Nate, \"but that wouldn't necessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you very athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either. You've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some truth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It all depends on what you decide to do with it.\"\n\"Hmmm,\" said Jack. \"Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request, after this one?\"\n\"Maybe,\" said Nate, \"it depends on what you decide then. There are more rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second request. You know how it goes.\" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had shoulders.\n\"Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent health doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially. Do I need to sign in blood or something?\"\n\"No,\" said Nate. \"Just hold out your hand. Or heel.\" Nate grinned. \"Or whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said, that's how it works - the poison, you know,\" Nate said apologetically.\nJack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it didn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better about the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot snake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to be able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack tried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it wouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.\n\"Hey, Jack,\" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind him, \"is that someone else coming up over there?\"\nJack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of nowhere? And did they bring food?\nWait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...\nJack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through his jeans...\nJack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. \"I would have decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to hoodwink me like that.\"\n\"I've been doing this a long time, Jack,\" said Nate, confidently. \"You humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you - especially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of minutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the health benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now.\"\n\"Yeah, well, still,\" said Jack, \"it's the principle of the thing. And nobody likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or something instead?\"\n\"More meat in the typical human butt,\" replied Nate. \"And less chance you accidentally kick me or move at the last second.\"",

How would y-- nonsense, you don't know them, least of all the governor.\"\nJames: \"Let's drive to the state capitol and find out, shall we? I bet you 50 bucks.\"\n\nStephen agrees, and as they reach the capitol, James is greeted on the stairs by numerous representatives when the governor storms out and is delighted to see him: \"James! Good to see you, old buddy, what's up?\"\n\nStephen raises his eyebrows and pays up the 50 dollars.\n\"Wow, you really do know people. It's still the same state though, but there's one person you possibly can't know in person - the President!\"\nJames: \"You're willing to bet?\"\nStephen: \"What the hell, I'll give you $500 if he recognizes you. I always wanted to see Washington, anyway.\"\n\nAfter they have landed in D.C., they take a taxi to the White House and decide to just stroll around a bit in front of it. Suddenly, the front gate opens, they are approached by the Secret Service and led into the building. As they reach the Oval Office, the chair swivels around and a delighted Barack Obama gets up and proceeds to give James a heartily hug: \"Jimmy, my friend, how's it going? I just saw you walking by outside, it'd be rude if I didn't invite you in and offer you something. Let me guess - coffee with a bit of milk and no sugar, as always, am I right?\"\n\nStephen drops his jaw: \"How on Earth... this.. how did you...\"\nJames grins: \"It's my personal little secret. About the $500...\"\nStephen: \"Yeah, take it. I still can't believe it. But -- there's still one person who definitely won't know you personally... the *Pope*. Five thousand dollars.\"\nJames: \"It's on, let's go to Rome.\"\nObama: \"Did you guys say Rome? Jimmy, why don't you take the Air Force One? I won't be needing it this week.\"\n\nThe next day they're wandering about St. Peter's Square, when the Swiss Guard approach the two: \"His Holiness was informed that you were in town, and he humbly requests your company. Would you please follow us?\"\n\nJames follows the guards, leaving behind a flabbergasted Stephen. After a few minutes, the Pope appears on the balcony together with James and both start waving to the cheering crowd below. Moments later, Stephen faints and James rushes down to help him.\n\nJames: \"You alright? Didn't expect me to know the Pope, did you?\"\n\nStephen: \"Well, I almost expected that -- but a couple of Asian tourists just asked me, 'Who is the funny-looking guy next to James?'\"",

They proceed to go upstairs to her bedroom and she takes off her clothes. The wanderer sees the naked misery sprawling on the bed and wonders how he's gonna get out of that situation when he sees a corn cob to his left. So he takes the corn cob, switches off the lights and gives it to her really good with the corn cob, which he throws out of the window afterwards.

Everytime he was leaving for work in the field, his wife would make him very delicious sandwiches. The sandwiches were made out of fresh baked bread, with homemade butter, cheese, ham, and fresh vegetables: tomatoes, lettuce and cucumbers. Eating them was his favorite part od the day, and he treated them as a reward for hard work he did. \n\nOne day the peasant went to work in the field and left his sandwiches on a nearby rock as he always did. After a few hours of work, he took a break and headed to the rock to enjoy his lunch, but... it was gone! A little angry and confused, he went back to work. The next day began and it was passing by as usual. Until the lunch time, when the poor man came to the rock to find out his sandwiches disappeared again! He got angry, but there was not much he could do, so he returned to work. On the third day, the situation occured again. It was too much. This time the peasant got really pissed and decided that the next day he would hide behind a tree and wait to reveal the sandwiches thief. \n\nHe did as he decided. He was waiting well hidden, keeping an eye on his lunch, but there was no living soul around. After an hour, suddenly, a great eagle flew out of nowhere, grabbed the lunch with it's claws and started to fly away. The shocked peasant threw himself into a pursuit of the bird. He followed the eagle until it landed in a nearby forest, not aware of being followed. The peasant hid behind a tree and watched the eagle. The bird unpacked the sandwhiches and threw all of the ingredients out: ham, cheese and fresh vegetables. Then the eagle took two slices of butter-covered bread, apllied them to it's chest rubbing them all over it, and said \"oh my god, I am so fucked up\".",

And the lawyer looks and goes, \"Dude, that just looks like a dildo, not interested,\" and the clerk says \"Ahaaaa, but this is not just any dildo, THIS..... is a Voodoo Dick!\"\n\nThe lawyer says \"Ok... So what's a Voodoo Dick...\" the clerk says \"VOODOO DICK! DOOR!\" And the voodoo dick zips out of the box and bangbangbangbang, starts fucking the door.\n\nThe clerk says VOODOO DICK, COUNTER!!! and bangbangbangbang, it starts fucking the counter. Then the clerk goes \"voodoo dick, box.\" And zip! It flies into the box and closes. \n\nThe lawyer says \"SOLD!!!\"Buys it and goes home. He walks in and gives his wife the voodoo dick and says \"Here, now i know i'm going away so i got you this voodoo dick, it's magical, all you gotta do is tell it to fuck you and it does the rest, so NOOOO CHEATING, you have a voodoo dick now, so no excuses.\" Then he kisses his wife and leaves.\n\nNext morning the wife is alone and horny, frustrated, heated, thinking about who to call when it dawns on her and she goes \"oooohhh let's try this thing out,\" so she pulls her panties down and says \"VOODOO DICK, PUSSY!!!!\" and the voodoo dick flies up her dress and just goes to town on her, she's having orgasm after orgasm, screaming, it goes on for hours, she's just loving this thing so much she loses track of time. She looks at the clock and says \"Oh shit i have to go to work, voodoo dick stop!\" But it doesn't, so she says \"voodoo dick get off!\" Doesn't work, so she's yelling at it, yanking at it, she tries everything, until she's like \"damnit i just have to go,\" so she adjusts her dress, gets in the car and she leaves. \n\nWell now she's doing 90 on the highway, swerving, driving erratically and suddenly 'WOOOOOooooo' cop car behind her. She pulls over, adjusts her hair, but she's a mess, red in the face, sweating, it's still fucking her, and the cop says, \"Do you have ANY fucking idea how fast you were going, what is your god damn problem lady??\"\n\nShe's like \"Ummmm, i can't tell you,\" and the cop goes, \"Well you better come up with SOMETHING, or you're getting arrested right now.\" So she says \"Ok ok! There's a magical voodoo dick fucking me, it won't stop, it's fucking me right now and it was fucking me the whole time i was driving and i can't get it to stop!\" So the cop pauses for a second and he's looking at her incredulously, and finally he gives her these beady eyes and he leans in real close and he says.......\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"VOODOO DICK MY ASS!!!!\"",

At least some of these catheter fetishists are also practitioners of free love, and it's not unusual for them to get together with (relatively) large numbers of other catheter fetishists for exactly this purpose.\n\nWithin one such community, there was a man who, though he had no catheter of his own, was both intensely into them and very respectful of those who had them.  While he was a bit prone to making lewd jokes involving them, he was always careful to avoid personal offense, and was therefore well liked by all involved, despite having flunked out of high school years before and thereby gaining a (generally undeserved) reputation of mild stupidity.\n\nDuring one of his community's \"gatherings,\" this man decided to show off an artifact that had come into his possession via convoluted circumstances (which we shall not detail here):  an original manuscript by James Joyce, written while Joyce was [weathering the Nazi occupation of France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce#1920.E2.80.9341:_Paris_and_Zurich).

They didn't have much money for new clothes or video games or internet access, so Zach had to get his entertainment by joining a club at his high school, where he was just beginning his freshman year. He'd been a rec diver in middle school, so he thought he might enjoy putting on a little muscle by joining the swim team. There were only ten or so people on the JV team so he made it easily, despite his inexperience. He came to practice after school everyday and worked out as hard as he could before going to work for his family's survival, because he believed in going all out in everything he did. He was no shining star at first, but over time, he came to be the fastest swimmer on the team. Coach did not fail to notice this, and promoted him to the varsity team (much to the dismay of the seniors onboard).\n\nIn the meantime, he wore the same gray swimsuit everyday, and he never did anything but school, swim, work, chores, sleep. His mother gave birth to a little brother in October just a month before the county tournament.\n\nUnfortunately, they can't make it to his meet that day. He's up on the blocks and ready to go. They blow the whistle and he's off. . .swimming. . .faster and faster. . .there's only one guy keeping with him at the flip-turn. He floors it back, but oh! he gets a cramp at the last moment. Nonetheless, he snags second place and a new Personal Record.\n\nAfter the race, Coach comes up behind him and wraps his towel around him and slaps him on the shoulder.\n\n\"You made second! You know what this means don't you! You're going to state!\"\n\n\"Wow! Really?\" he replies.\n\n\"Yes, but there's one thing. You need to bring $50 by the first day of December to pay for registration.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know about that, Coach,\" he says, questioningly, eyes downcast, \"we aren't exactly the richest folk in the world.\"\n\n\"Oh, come on man, it's just $50. I'm sure your dad will give it to you if you ask really nicely. And if you can't come up with it all, I'll give you a few bucks just to get to see you swim like that again!\"\n\n\"Oh, thanks Coach. I'll ask him.\"\n\nSo he goes home to his dad, who just happens to be in his chair making calls.\n\n\"Dad, guess what!\" he begins.\n\n\"What, son?\"\n\n\"I made second place in the county meet!\"\n\n\"That's great! I wish I could swim like that! I guess that means you get to go to state?\"\n\n\"It sure does. . . ,\" and he sighs, \"but I need fifty dollars for registration. . .\"\n\n\"Oh, no worries, son, we want to see you succeed. I'm sure we can scrape it together. . . .\"\n\n\". . .by next week.\"\n\n\"Well, there are going to be hardships, but we can do it.\"\n\nSo they cut back on food, stopped going to the movies, and had a small yard sale, and within the week they had fifty dollars. Zach went in to see Coach with the money.\n\n\"Well, Coach, we had to go through so many hardships last week, skipping lunches and working overtime, but I got the fifty dollars. We're going to state!\"\n\nOf course, the baby got a rare early case of colic and once again the family could not attend the meet. He rode in Coach's car to the state capital, receiving a pep talk the whole way.\n\nSo Zach is up on the blocks again. He's focused better than ever. The buzzer sounds and he's in the Zone before he even hits the water. He's flying faster than ever before. He flip-turns a full second before anyone in any of the lanes. He maintains his second all the way back to the starting end, and drags himself, thoroughly exhausted out of the pool.\n\nHis eyes are still apparently swimming because he is not sure why Coach is congratulating him at first.\n\n\". . .not only first place, but a new School Record! You're the best swimmer our school has ever had! You're going to the semi-finals! You're going to Regionals!\"\n\n\". . .! WOOHOO!\"\n\n\"And you're going to get a brand new swimsuit with your name on it and a towel with the school mascot. Just bring $200 with you to school next. . .\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, Coach!\" he interjects, \"two. . .HUNDRED. . .American dollars? Did I not tell you about my situation before this meet?\"\n\n\"Yes, well, you have to get it for the hotel and registration. I'm sure you are your dad can work something out. I know you want this, and I want it for you, for our school, as much as you. You're the best we've ever had. You have to try.\"\n\n\"Okay, Coach, it's going to be hard, but I'll try!\"\n\nSo Zach goes home to his dear old dad the news.\n\n\"Dad, I got first place at state and I broke the school record on lap time!\"\n\n\"That's great, son! So, you're going to Regional?\"\n\n\"Yes. . .well. . .if we can get $200 by the end of the month.\"\n\n\"Well, we are behind you 100%, son, but there are going to be hardships. You'll have to throw in with us to get you there.\"\n\nSo Dad starts working another job at night, and Mom uses the last of their foodstamps on a month's supply of Infamil and peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches. They take out a second mortgage on the house, and Zach and his sister spend every hour at home baby-sitting, while the other is out working.\n\nSomehow, they manage to stay afloat the whole month, and get the $200, so Zach, worked completely to the bone and worn slap out but still as determined as ever returned to Coach with the cash.\n\n\"Well, Coach, the hardships I and my family went through were nigh on unbearable this time, but I got the $200 for the Regional meet. Let's get this show on the road.\"\n\nZach's family had to stay at home working to keep themselves alive, while Zach drove with Coach to the next state. He did nothing but stretch in his hotel room the night before so he would be at the top of his game in the morning. His mom called three times worrying about him, once in the middle of the night. \"The baby woke me up-we're running out of Infamil,\" she claimed.\n\nThe next morning, Zach stood on the blocks poised for the dive. He knew he would win before the buzzer even sounded. He wouldn't admit it to himself, but he knew. He made it down and back in under 20 seconds, but Zach was standing with a towel around his shoulders accepting his gold medal before he even realized he'd left the platform. Coach woke him up with an open-handed blow to the back.\n\n\"You won, son! You're in the Finals! You're going to Junior Nationals!\"\n\n\"How much is it this time?\"\n\n\"Oh, just a little old thousand dollars, and that's because the rest of the team, and the boosters, and I, are providing the other thousand. We really want you to win this one. Do you think you can manage it?\"\n\n\"Well, we've been through a lot of hardships already. I suppose I'm getting accustomed to it. I'll try Coach. I won't let you down if I can help it!\" Zach replied\n\n\"Yeah, you're worth the investment, kid. Good luck!\"\n\nSo Zach went before his Dad again, between his 3PM-11PM and 12AM-8AM job shifts, and told him the news. Dad of course, was expecting the mood damper this time:\n\n\"Congratulations! Great Job, son! I knew you'd do us proud! How much is it for Nationals?\"\n\n\"A thou.\" \n\n\"SHIT*! *ahem* I mean. . .we're behind you still, son. I know we can work it out.\"\n\nThey cut the baby down to one Infamil a day. They were all too busy working all night to hear its endless bawling anyway. Sis picked up another job. Zach picked up a paper route, but was exempted from afternoon work so he could train. Dad continued working his three jobs, but they to put Ma out streetwalking betweens shifts to make ends meet. They were all malnourished, and still insisted that Zach take extra portions. They began renting out the attic to anyone who could do without breakfast. If ever any family faced hardships, it was this one.\n\nBut they got the grand.\n\nHe goes to Coach. \"Coach, I got the money. We're going to Alaska!\"\n\nDon't ask who's idea it was to have the thing in Alaska.\n\nWell, of course, the thing was televised. Mainly as a human interest story about Zach. Zach's family took the night of the competition off to watch Zach swim. . .on their neighbor's television, of course, because they had sold theirs when their cable got cut off.\n\nBefore he went up on the blocks, he got to talk to the news reporter.\n\n\"I know you've heard what kind of hardships I've been through to get here,\" he proclaimed, \"but I'm just happy to have such support and to get a chance to swim. I'd like to thank my family, if they're watching. I love you guys. We shared these hardships, and, should I win, the victory will be all of ours!\"\n\nHow very touching. His family cheered.\n\nOut of the blocks Zach flew at the buzzer. A kid who had been swimming since he fell out of the womb was in the next lane, and kept right next to him the whole. He even pulled ahead a few times, but not only did he lack the sheer determination Zach, he also lacked the streamlining several months of near-starvation can give you. Zach won by three tenths of a second, snagging the gold once again.\n\nAfter the race, and before the awards presentation, Coach wrapped Zach up and steered him toward a man in a business suit.\n\n\"Hi Zach. I'm as touched by your story as any, but I'm more impressed with your skill as a swimmer. I'm with the US Olympic Team. We want you to swim for Team USA in the Olympic Games in Africa next summer.\"\n\n\"Well, sure, but. . .how much will it cost?\"\n\n\"Haha, don't you know anything about the Olympics, man?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You ain't gotta pay a dime.\"\n\nZach collected his medal and went home. A mob of students in his school cafeteria carried him around on their shoulders until concerned administrators broke it up. He was proclaimed a hero in his town, and even got some obscure resolution passed about him in the state legislature. Wasn't worth the paper it was printed on, of course, but his family didn't hesitate to frame it. They also received plenty of what was worth more than the paper it was printed on. Cold hard cash, always enclosed with Zach's fan mail.\n\nWhile the money covered most of their recently accrued debts, they never forgot their time of need and continued to live frugally. They were completely accustomed to hardships. Zach didn't fail to mention this when he boarded the yacht Team USA purchased to party their way across to Africa during that Olympic summer.\n\n\"You all know what hardships I've been through, but I hope you can overlook that. Also, I hope the ladies and the bartenders on this boat can overlook the fact that I'm still a sophomore in high school.\"\n\nWell, the party began immediately, and when the drinking and the sex got old, the Olympians sought out a little friendly competition between them to entertain themselves. They were only a couple of days from shore, and fairly restless to pick up their last-minute training.\n\nSo one night, they were all sitting around a table with their beers. Yes, Zach too, but the guys swore not to tell his parents. One guy turns to the guy next to him.\n\n\"Hey Joe, you're on the track team right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, man, I'm a sprinter.\"\n\n\"Aw, really, lemme see you run?\"\n\nAnother piped up, \"Yeah, I wanna see this too, Joe!\"\n\nSo Joe took a lap around the deck in just under 15 fifteen seconds-Zach was timing. He almost knocked a waiter over the side as he sped past.\n\n\"That's amazing, Joe!\"\n\n\"I've never seen anyone run that fast in my life!\"\n\nZach was speechless.\n\nHe stopped in front of his challenger and caught his breath. \"Lar, I don't know how you Field guys spend your time, but I've seen you out there, throwing your disc-thing. Give this boy here a show of your own.\"\n\n\"Sure give me a discus.\"\n\nJoe grabbed a dinner plate and tossed it to Larry.\n\n\"Stand back, kid\"\n\nHe wound up and flung the plate almost to the horizon, where it exploded before hitting the water.\n\nEveryone looked up to the Sun Deck where Barney, a pentathlete, was just lowering his rifle.\n\n\"Nice toss, Lar!\" He shouted down, \"Welcome to come toss birds at my ranch any time!\"\n\n\"Nice shootin' yourself, Barn!\"\n\nThey all proceeded to pat one another on the back, and return to their table, when Steve joined them. Larry grabbed him and addressed the rest of the table.\n\n\"Ya'll know my teammate, Steve, here. Best javelin man in the western hemisphere, he is.\"\n\n\"Give us a demo, man,\" said Joe.\n\n\"Ain't got a javelin.\"\n\nJoe grabbed a midget that was walking by.\n\n\"Throw this,\" he said, handing over the midget. \"Not because it's short, but because it's French.\"\n\nSo Steve went to the rail and drew back and heaved the midget screaming as far as it would go. There was a tiny splash on the horizon. There was no sound by the last of the screams on the wind. Everyone was speechless. Moments later, the cheers began.\n\n\"I ain't never seen a toss like that in my life!\" Barney said, \"We're sure to win, this year!\"\n\nThen they turned to Zach. \"Hey kid. You're a swimmer, right? You gonna put us all to shame?\"\n\n\"Where do you expect me to swim?\" Zach replied. \"I'm not going in the water with all those sharks, and the swimming pool is only 10 feet wide.\"\n\nThey all nodded and scratched their heads. \"Well, you gotta show us something!\"\n\n\"Well, I did used to do a bit of diving in my younger years. I could dive for you.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose that would work,\" Steve said.\n\nSo Zach climbed onto the diving board of the deck pool, ran to the end, and turned a flip into a perfect dive. He didn't make but a tiny splash.\n\nThe guys were unimpressed.\n\n\"Well, I guess that was okay. But I think I could do the same. . . ,\" Barney put in.\n\n\"Well, tell you what. What if I climbed to the next deck, and dived off that railing. Would you see that?\" Zach countered.\n\n\"I'll buy that for a dollar,\" a member of the gathering crowd stated simply.\n\nZach climbed the stairs to the next deck and pulled himself to the other side of the railing. He dived off backwards, moving ten feet backwards and landing dead center of the pool in a perfect swan dive.\n\nSome started to applaud, until a member of the diving team shouted, \"I learned that freshman year of high school.\" He then climbed up and repeated the stunt, adding a backflip for good measure.\n\n\"Well, he never said he was a diver,\" Steve said helpfully.\n\n\"I don't need your help,\" Zach retorted, and without another word began climbing up three decks onto the radar tower. He stood there fifty feet above and twenty feet behind the pool, lifting one foot and then the other as the radar device turned. He worked up the courage, ignoring the worried shouts from below. Not even hearing them. He took three steps and ran off the edge of the tower. He wrapped his arms around himself, crossed his legs, then bent and twisted. He turned 720 degrees and two full flips before spreading out into swan form and landing head first *SMACK* in the center of the deck, five feet behind the edge of the pool.\n\nHe went out in an instant and lay there limp as a ragdoll. The crowd rushed to his side. Someone called some paramedics from the African coast. The moment the helicopter was landing on the deck, Zach was just standing up, with a few helping hands. He had a huge bruise on his forehead and he was a bit woozy, but he could talk. The paramedics ran over, grabbed him away, and laid him on a stretcher to take away in case of concussion. He didn't let them get the buckles down before he stood up again.\n\n\"I feel fine, guys.\" He held himself erect and walked a straight line back to the crowd.\n\nSo Steve just had to pipe up, \"What are you doing, boy? You almost died!\"\n\n\"I'm alright,\" said Zach. \"I told you. . .\n\n. . .I'm used to Hard Ships!\"",

By a stroke of luck, it was a Saudi national holiday the day their trial finished, and the extremely benevolent Sheikh decided they could be released after receiving just 20 lashes each of the whip.\nAs they were preparing for their punishment, the Sheikh announced: \"It's my first wife's birthday today, and she has asked me to allow each of you one wish before your whipping.\nThe German was first in line, he thought for a while and then said: \"Please tie a pillow to my back. This was done, but the pillow only lasted 10 lashes before the whip went through. When the punishment was done the German had to be carried away bleeding and crying with pain.\nThe Frenchman was next up. After watching the German in horror he said smugly: \"Please fix two pillows to my back.\" But even two pillows could only take 15 lashes before the whip went through again and the Frenchman was soon led away whimpering loudly.\nThe Englishman was the last one up, but before he could say anything, the Sheikh turned to him and said: \"You are from a most beautiful part of the world and your culture is one of the finest in the world. For this, you may have two wishes!\"\n\"Thank you, your Most Royal and Merciful highness,\" the Englishman replied. \"In recognition of your kindness, my first wish is that you give me not 20, but 100 lashes.\"\n\"Not only are you an honorable, handsome and powerful man, you are also very brave,\" the Sheikh said with an admiring look on his face. \"If 100 lashes is what you desire, then so be it. And your second wish, what is it to be?\" the Sheikh asked.\nThe Englishman smiled and said, \"Tie the Frenchman to my back.\"",

And then, the antelope sees a way out - its a large, deep hole covered with grass - an old trap set up by a hunter many years ago. In a skillful leap, the antelope jumps over the trap, but the lion is not so lucky. He sees the hole too late and falls through the grass all the way down. \n\nHurt and disoriented, he tries to climb out, but the trap is too deep. The antelope, ecstatic that her plan worked, can't resist the urge to go back and gloat a little. She comes to the very edge of the trap and starts mocking the lion. \"That's what you get, you old fart! I hope you never manage to get out of that hole!\" Then, an idea comes.  \"You've eaten a lot of my friends, Lion. And now, I'm going to get my revenge.\" With those words, she starts to spit at the lion. Unable to escape, the lion is forced to suffer. \n\nThe antelope walks away, but something just doesn't seem right. \"I saw you tear into my best friend last month. You deserve more than just me spitting on you.\" The antelope turns around and starts pissing on the lion. Covered in piss, the lion feels defeated and angry, but can't do anything about it. \n\nFeeling satisfied, the antelope trots happily away... but another thought pops into her head. \"When else am I gonna get a chance like this? There is a helpless lion at my disposal. I'm gonna take a shit on his head.\" She goes back to the hole. As she's merrily walking towards the hole, she starts singing, \"I'm gonna shit on your head, I'm gonna shit on your head.\"\n\nShe gets to the hole and looks down. The hole is empty. The lion is gone. Someone behind her clears their throat, and she falls over to the ground from fear. With the lion above her, about to tear into her flesh, she looks up and in the sweetest voice she says, \"Lion, dearest, you won't believe this. I came back to apologize.\"",

We thank them for their insight into real-world broadcasting.\n\n**GRUNDMAN'S LAW** -- Under the most carefully controlled conditions of pressure, temperature, humidity and other variables, the system will perform as it damn well pleases.\n\n**KNIGHT'S LAW** -- A pat on the back is only a few centimeters from a kick in the pants.\n\n**HIDLEY'S LAW** -- Nothing is impossible for a man who doesn't have to do the work.\n\n**DUNCAN'S LAW** -- When in doubt, mumble.\n\n**EVAN'S LAW** -- Every man has a scheme that will not work.\n\n**HULKO'S LAW** -- A theory is better than its explanation.\n\n**STORYK'S LAW** -- The amount of work done varies inversely with the amount of time spent in the office.\n\n**WORAM'S LAW** -- Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\n\n**NORDAHL'S LAW** -- Everything goes wrong at once.\n\n**EMERMAN'S LAW** -- In a crisis that forces a choice to be made among alternative courses of action, people tend to choose the worst possible course.\n\n**TARSIA'S LAW** -- The obvious answer is always overlooked.\n\n**SNODDY'S LAW** -- It works better if you plug it in.\n\n**HARRISON'S LAW** -- There is always an easy answer to every problem-- neat, plausible, and wrong.\n\n**MEADOW'S LAW** -- It won't work.\n\n**WESTLAKE'S LAW** -- The first 90 percent of the project takes 90 percent of the time, and the last 10 percent takes the other 90 percent.\n\n**HARNED'S LAW** -- Once you open a can of worms, the only way to recan them is to use a larger can.\n\n**SCHNEE'S LAW** -- Anything that begins well will end badly. (Note: The converse of this law is not true.)\n\n**STONE'S LAW** -- Necessity is the mother of strange bedfellows.\n\n**GOLDEN'S LAW** -- A man with one watch knows what time it is. A man with two watches is never sure.\n\n**PERRY'S LAW** -- If the facts do not conform to the theory, they must be disposed of.\n\n**GARAY'S LAW** -- An object will fall so as to do the most damage.\n\n**KELSEY'S LAW** -- Make three correct guesses consecutively and you will establish yourself as an expert.\n\n**LIGHTNER'S LAW** -- If it happens, it must be possible.\n\n**GUY'S LAW** -- The probability of a given event occurring is inversely proportional to its desirability.\n\n**MOYSSIADIS' LAW** -- As soon as you mention something, if it's good, it goes away; if it's bad, it happens.\n\n**CAPPS' LAW** -- If it can find a way to wear out faster, it will.\n\n**LIPPELL'S LAW** -- If a research project is not worth doing, it is not worth doing well.\n\n**NEUMANN'S LAW** -- Whoever has the gold makes the rules.\n\n**CALBI'S LAW** -- Nothing is as easy as it looks.\n\n**MARINO'S LAW** -- Everything takes longer than you think it will.\n\n**TODRANK'S LAW** -- There are two types of people: those who divide people into two types, and those who do not.\n\n**BROSIOUS' LAW** -- The components you have will expand to fill the available space.\n\n**INGOLDSBY'S LAW** -- You cannot determine beforehand which side of the bread to butter.\n\n**MERTEN'S LAW** -- The more time you spend in reporting on what you are doing, the less time you have to do anything. Stability is achieved when you spend all your time reporting on the nothing you are doing.\n\n**ZENTZ'S LAW** -- Inside every large problem is a small problem struggling to get out.\n\n**LUDWIG'S LAW** -- The other line moves faster.\n\n**DOZIER'S LAW** -- Negative expectations yield negative results.

        "body": "So in my calculus class last year in math, there were these two Chinese twins. Ving, and Ling. Ving was always super cool with me. In exchange for answers (he was super smart) I would hang out with him and be his friend and stuff. After I cheated off of him and studied with him though, I did get to be his friend and we got very close. His sister, Ling, was always uptight about school and she made sure to study, she got stressed about a B, etc. One day I was hanging out with Ving, and we started talking about names. He went off on this huge rant about how he hated his, and how he wanted to change it to something more Asian-American, like Lee. I told him that the Courthouse downtown had a form that you could fill to legally change it. He told me:\n\n\"I always give you answers. If you could just drive me down to the courthouse this one time, I will never forget you. I just hate this god-forsaken Chinese name and I want to get rid of it forever.\" He seemed pretty adamant about it, so I decided the best decision would be to take him. We walked out to my car, and right as I put the keys in the ignition Ling came running and tapped on the car door like a madman. I rolled it down and she started freaking out about how Ving's name had been passed down through generations and generations, but Ving didn't care. He just wanted to go down to the Courthouse and get it over with. Ling figured that coming with would be the best idea, so if anything else came up that she would be needed for, she would be there for Ving. Honestly, I felt stuck in the middle of a family feud, so I just took her along.\n\nWhen we got to the Courthouse, Ving confidently walked up to the front desk and asked the receptionist if he could change his name. She gave him a little packet of paper and told him to sit down. Ling and I waited patiently while Ving filled out his info. I was watching him fill it out and I noticed he really did want to change his name to Lee. Before he finished, though, he started tearing up. He told me he couldn't change his name. He asked the lady at the front that he couldn't do it, and she told him he would need twenty dollars to cancel the request. Ling was so relieved and happy that he changed his mind, she dug through her purse, found the money, and started to hand it to the receptionist.\n\nIt was at this moment that the most stereotypical Asian man burst through the doors. He was wearing a Hawaiian shirt, a visor, American flag shorts, flip flops, everything. This little guy was decked out.\nWhen Ving and his old man saw each other, they both started bawling, and embraced each other. Out of his tears, Ving said\n\"Dad, I love my name. I want to be Ving forever, and I'm going to name my kids Ving, and they're going to name their kids Ving, and-\"\nAnd the old man said \"Dont, stop. Be Lee, Ving! Hold onto that fee, Ling.\"",

After three days in the woods, these three friends had not eaten or drank anything, dissorientated from dehydration and lack of sustenance, they became lost.\n\nEventually they stumbled upon a cabin in an otherwise desolate part of the forest. Excited at the prospect of food, the three hunters approached the cabin and knocked on the door. An old and notably discusting woman answered the door rather irrately demanding they explain themselves.\n\nOne of the hunters explained their situation and plead with her for food and water. The old woman told them that she had more than enough food and water to spare...in return she required sexual satisfaction from at least one of them.\n\nTwo of the men said,\"Hell no, look at her she has to be at least 70 years old.\" The third man, having no shame, said,\"Fuck it, y'all can starve, I'm going to get some food.\"\n\nSo the old woman graciously lead the man into her house and up a flight of stairs into her bedroom. As she stripped and sprawled out on the bed, the man noticed a horrific looking scab over her vagina, and in shock yelled,\"WHAT THE HELL.\" Noting to himself mentally that it looked strangly like a small pepperoni pizza.\n\nThe woman explained that it was nothing serious just something that came with old age telling him,\"Don't worry about it honey, just tear it off.\" Doing as instructed the young man threw the discusting scab out the window and began to make the old womans day.\n\nUpon completion of this horrific task the man emerged from the cabin with large sacks of groceries and bottles of water. He then noticed his friends were laughing their asses off and asked why. They replied,\"While you were up there fucking that nasty old bitch, someone threw us down a pepperoni pizza.\"\n",

But when they arrived at the Viking capital of Birka they made the vikings there very angry by insulting their gods. The missionaries were siezed and were thrown to the mercy of the King.\n\nThe King said: \"Ansgar, you did not insult our gods, but you are the leader of this abhorrent mission so you are still responsible. But I am a merciful King. You can choose between an honorable death, or dishonor by 10 r\u00f8fahnutl. Which do you choose?\"\n\nAnsgar didn't know what r\u00f8fahnutl was, but thought that anything was better than death, so he said \"I chose r\u00f8fahnutl\". The vikings tore of Ansgars clothes, and 10 of them proceeded to rape him in the ass.\n\nThe king then addressed Witmar and said \"You insulted our gods, but I am a merciful King. You can choose between an honorable death, or dishonor by 20 r\u00f8fahnutl. Which do you choose?\"\n\nAnsgar whispered to Witmar \"We can lie about this when we come back to Bremen, anything is better than death!\" Witmar nodded and said \"I choose r\u00f8fahnutl\" and 20 vikings then proceeded to rape him in the ass.\n\nLastly the king adressed Heinze, and said \"You insulted our gods the worst, but I am a merciful King. You can choose between an honorable death, or dishonor by 50 r\u00f8fahnutl. Which do you choose?\" \n\nHeinze stood up and said \"I choose honor, and I choose death!\"\n\nThe king responded \"Your bravery honours you! I hereby sentence you to death by r\u00f8fahnutl!\"\n",

One day, the circus comes to town. Having nothing else to do (as there was no internet or video games in that time), Jeffrey decides to buy a ticket.\n\nThe show ended up selling out, but Jeffrey managed to snag a good seat before they were all taken: two rows back from the front, dead center. Jeffrey sits, content, as the circus starts. A group of clowns roll out in a tiny car and engage in jokes and tomfoolery. Suddenly, one of the clowns points at Jeffrey.\n\n\"You, sir! Would you please stand up?\" cries the clown.\n\n\"Me?\" replies Jeffrey.\n\n\"Yes, sir, if you could stand?\"\n\nJeffrey stands.\n\n\"Well,\" says the clown, \"I see the horse's ass, but where's the rest of the horse?\"\n\nThe audience erupts in laughter, but Jeffrey is mortified and humiliated. Choking back tears, he runs from the circus tent back to his home, where he weeps in privacy. \n\nA few months later, Jeffrey is reading a magazine and notices an advertisement on one of the pages: \"Johnny Tanner's School for Witty Retorts\".\n\n\"Hm,\" Jeffrey says to himself, \"maybe this will help me be less sensitive.\" So, ignoring the rather hefty price tag, he applies for the course. He sends his cash in and is mailed a few worksheets in return. \n\nMonths pass, and Jeffrey completes worksheet after worksheet. One day, however, his usual packet didn't come in the mail. Instead was a plain white envelope, with \"Johnny Tanner\" listed on the return address. \n\n\"Dear Jeffrey,\" the letter read, \n\n\"I have to confess to you that my school is nothing more than a scam. I'm not qualified to give degrees in witty retorts. However, I have noticed from your worksheets that you honestly have a knack for this. I regret my actions, so as a gesture of good will, I'm going to pull a few strings and recommend you to the University of Pennsylvania's College of Witty Retorts.\n\nGood Luck Kid,\nJohnny Tanner\"\n\nSo Jeffrey goes to the University of Pennsylvania's College of Witty Retorts (one of the more highly regarded schools of Witty Retorts in the country), and promptly amazes all of his professors with his talent. He gets straight A's without ever breaking a sweat and is accepted into Stanford's Graduate School of Witty Retorts. Even before he receives his PhD in Witty Retorts, his reputation spreads. He is consulted by businessmen and politicians, and even the Pope sends a discreet emissary Jeffrey's way when he needs some tips on dealing with some of the more uppity cardinals. \n\nAfter graduation, Jeffrey's Witty Retort Consulting business takes off. He spends a lot of time travelling, but ultimately returns home to live in his hometown so he can be close to his aging mother. He's a bit of a local celebrity, but is always modest and humble about his success.\n\nOne day, he sees that the circus is coming to town; the VERY SAME circus that had humiliated him years before. The circus once again sells out, but Jeffrey is able to pull some strings thanks to his new-found prestige and manages to get the exact same seat he had all those yeas ago. Once again, the circus opens with the clowns, and once again, the head clown asks him to stand. He doesn't recognize Jeffrey (though he's somewhat famous, Jeffrey is discreet and very rarely photographed), and when Jeffrey stands, the clown once again shouts:\n\n\"Well, I see the horse's ass, but where's the rest of the horse?\"\n\nThe whole town turns to look at Jeffrey, eagerly awaiting his reply. Jeffrey closes his eyes, inhales through his nose, and in a clear, distinct voice says\n\n\"FUCK YOU, CLOWN!\"",

Eventually they came out and admitted defeat.\n\nNext in were the Green Berets, they spent over a year in the jungle laying trip wires and surveillance cameras. But they too couldn't see a rabbit nevermind catch one.\n\nFinally the Vietcong went in, the Americans scoffed at the ragtag bunch, thinking, if we couldn't catch a rabbit, these guys haven't got a hope in hell.\n\nAbout an hour later the Vietcong emerge from the jungle holding a flying squirrel by the ears and declare themselves the winners. The Americans confused say: \"but that's not a rabbit!\"\n\nThe Vietcong put a gun to the squirrels head and he starts shouting: \"I'm a rabbit, I'm a rabbit!\"",

Three Navi warriors are chosen to go back in time to just before the war, and hijack the avatar equipment used by humans to pose as Navi.  With some modifications to the machines, the Navi are able to pose as humans.

Having seen the movie during the flight to Earth, the Navi are able to locate the lost ark and create a series of elaborate traps to lead Indiana Jones into a temple of doom.  Dr. Jones is not so easily fooled, however, and he is able to excavate details about the Navi\u2019s plans and their physical appearance. \n\nIndiana Jones gets the drop on the Navi, slaughtering the trio inside the doom temple.

So yesterday when she went out, I decided that I would do it.\n\nFor the most part it was just typical teenage mess, clothes everywhere, the occasional food wrapper. However when i was cleaning out her closet, I found her diary. My initial reaction was just to put it back as i didn't want to invade her privacy, so I finished cleaning and left her room. But later that evening, my curiosity got the better of me and I got the diary, took it to my room and read it.\n\nI was horrified to discover that she has a new boyfriend, and that they've been having sex. She described in graphic detail all the kinky stuff they'd been doing and how she had performed oral sex on him. And then, just at the point I thought that the debauchery could not get any worse, you'll never guess what I came across next. Page 64, the bed sheets and my own leg a little bit.\n",

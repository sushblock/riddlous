Every day Maria, a homely 300 pound prostitute would hang her ample barely concealed breasts over the balcony and call to him. \"Hey Pedro, can I wind your clock?\" Every day he would smile and turn red, but keep on walking. Finally one day she called to him, \"Hey Pedro, can I wind your clock?\" and he sheepishly asked her how much it would cost. \"Only 10 pesos for you, Pedro,\" she called down. Pedro looked around, the street was empty, so he slipped in the door and went up to Maria's room. He knocked on the door, Maria opened it, and quickly enveloped him into her vast bulk.  For the next week, Pedro avoided Maria's street. Finally he walked past the brothel again on his way home from work. Maria was there on her balcony and called down to him. \"Hey Pedro, can I wind your clock?\" Eyes wide, Pedro shook his head. \"No thank you,\" he said, \"It is still ticking from the last time!\"",

The name is, 'My Mom is a whore and my dad is a pimp.'\"\nThe small club owner responds: \"What? Whatever, it's your song so you may name it as you please. Would you like to play at my bar tomorrow night? It pays well.\"\nThe pianist ecstatically agreed to his offer.\n\nThe next night comes around and he does as he did the night before except this time at the small club owners place. He plays the piano so gracefully that the entire room is visibly weeping from its elegance. The song attracts the attention of the owner of the largest club in the city and asks him, \"My good sir, what is the name of that wondrous tune?\" \n\"Oh that old thing? It's called, 'I met My Wife at a Family Reunion.'\"\nThe big time club owner says, \"Erm...alright...anyways, I would love it if you played at my club this coming weekend. The pay is 10 times what it is here.\"\n\nThe pianist, once again, ecstatically agrees.\n\nNext weekend comes around and he plays at the renowned venue, moving everyone in attendance to gushing tears. He walks off the stage to use the restroom.\n\nAs he walks out of the restroom one of the bouncers approaches him and says, \"Sir, you do know, Your zippers undone and your dick is out?\"\n\nThe pianist responds, \"Do I know it?

They tried not to step on any ducks but eventually the first woman stepped on one. St. Peter came to the woman and told her that her punishment for stepping on a duck was to be chained to a very ugly man for eternity. After seeing the punishment that the first woman had received, the two other women tried very hard to not step on any ducks, but eventually the second woman accidentally stepped on a duck. The same punishment was given to her. The third woman tried very hard to not step on any ducks and went many months without stepping on any. One day, without a word, St. Peter came up to the third woman and handcuffed the most handsome man she had ever seen to her. \"What did I ever do to deserve this?\" she said.

He tried applying for many jobs, but they just didn't quite work out. \n\n\nAfter ending up in the drug business to support his family, a deal went bad and he was shot, landing him in the hospital. The night his family arrived to check on him, the same shooter made his way to his room murdered his wife and three children and somehow managed to evade police..\n\n\nMonths after this incident, Charlie, the same chicken who was in the hospital and who had witnessed his family's murder- was finally released. \n\n\nCharlie was a shell of his former self. He had nothing to live for, nothing to look forward to. He took up alcohol abuse for some time, until realizing what truly had to be done. He began tracking down his family's killer, and with each day spent, he became closer and closer to discovering the dealer's whereabouts. \nOne day, he finally figured out who it was. \nAs he arrived at the killers' home, Charlie took one last deep breath, then stormed in. After fighting through many of the dealers' body-gaurds, Charlie finally reached the notorious drug dealing murderer, Albert Smith. \n\n\nAs a bloody battle ensued, it was clear who the winner would be... Charlie staggered out of the destroyed home, bloodied, yet victorious, he realized something. All the tracking, all the killing, all the bloodshed he had created, was All. In. Vain. He realized that taking Alberts's life didn't, and wouldn't, bring his family back. Finding himself dumbfounded, he began to run. He headed down, through the fields to where the bad drug deal happened, almost a year ago now.\n\n\nHe took one last deep breath, gazed at the stars through tear-caked eyes and took his first step on the road. This was it he decided, he was finally going to reunite with his family again once more, for the final time. As the headlights raced towards him, he closed his eyes - wings outstretched, and heard his family whisper gently to him \n\n\n\n\n\n\"You're finally home Charlie, you're finally home\".\n\nCharlie had finally crossed to the other side.",

Nein!!!! and is mad at Voldemort. Like, he doesn't want to kill Voldemort, he's just annoyed cause he's so fukin depressing.\nSo then Stalin walks in and he's fukn pissed too\n\"Fukin Voldemort!\"\nand he drinks an entire bottle of the finest vodka and hurls it to the ground; shattering it into itty bitty pieces,\n\"Fukn Voldemort, you little bitch\"\nThen Osama walks in and does the whole screaming terrorist shit,\"Allahlalalalalalalalalalalala!!!!!\" but he doesn't run towards Voldemort and blow up cause he can just use other terrorists to do that shit for him. Osama could feel Voldemort's pain, but he wanted the Dark Lord to use his feelings for great things and not be annoying.\n\nAnyways so all the evil people of history come and you can get the picture. Pol, Ted, Kim, Cartman with a Hitler moustache, fuckin even Saddam Hussein comes and is like, \"Damn Voldemort, you be lookn kinda sexy right now. 'I wonder how warm his asshole is...hmm'\" *imagination*\nok.\nso.\nAll the evil dudes are talking to each other and they're all agreeing that Voldemort is being a little bitch. But they can't kill him because of those fucking dementors. So randomly, Snape tries to reassure these bastards, \"You guys do realise you're already dead, right?...so the dementors can't steal your souls...\" but Evil can sense Evil and Snapes Evil meter was kind of low, so they offed him. Very easily.\n\nMao Zedingdong was especially mad, even though he appeared calm and happy outwardly, \"Just stop!.....No...No...don't you stare at me, nope...Voldy....come on you little fuck....don't be staring at me like that....don't be giving me the creep look!\"\nSo when fukn Voldemort opens he's creepy ass eyes he just fukn....\nman.\nit's just so depressing thinking about Voldemort...\npoor Voldy.\nnever got to kill Harry Potter. \nSome say there's an alternate universe where Voldemort conquered over all...\nBut he didn't.\n\nPoor, poor, voldy.\nThe saddest creepiest little bitch anyone knew.....\nBut Voldemort never cried. He just thought really hard. Cause he was fuckin Smart! Like Satan.\n\nFukin Satan used to be all second in command to the universe and shit and empathised with poor little Voldy. Anyways that's WAY the fuck off topic to the joke but whatever.\nso where was i...\ni haven't even got to the punchline yet.\nhmm...\nlet me just finish the joke.\nfuck.\nso!\n\nWhile all this Shit is going on, there are these creepy green ghosts flying around and of course, the cockroaches.\nFukn Voldemort loved cockroaches because they reminded him of the biggest cocks in the world. And yes I am talking about roosters. Voldy loved to get up early in the morning with the roosters and watch the sun rise. This nigga stared at the sun until he went blind so, it was kind of understandable why Voldemort had some creepy eyes and yes, he was weird.\n\nAll the evil people are still upset. Very very mad at Voldemort. So they argued for generations. Millions of years. And then they had a random staring contest. But fuckn Voldemort always won because he stared at the sun all the time.\nman.\ni always get to the punchline.\nBut i'm feeling kind of sad for poor little voldy. I mean,\nnot depressingly cuz voldemort IS an annoying little bitch.\naaaanyways...\n*sigh*\nso yeah.\nok now im on the verge of repeating myself, fuck.\n\nSo then.........this guy...this fukin random ass guy shows up with a sword. Like what the fuck...seriously! He was legendary too, but Hitler and Stalin were confused because he was good. Fuckin Aragorn from Lord of the Rings starts flailing his sword around all epically and shit, and all the evil dudes know this niggas a fictional character. They're like, \"Seriously, how the fuck? What? Why are you here?\" \nAnd Aragorn be like, \"Dude! I need my army for the 3rd Lord of the Rings movie! Wanna come?\" Evil dudes: \"Fuck yeah!\" \n\nSo Aragorn takes Hitler, all those motherfuckers, and the green ghosts to fight the orcs and shit and be all epic in the movie.\n\nBut they lived a fantasy. And fukn Voldemort had the courage to stare at the sun and go blind.\n...and shit\nso\nAragorn is gone, hitler is gone, Stalin.......\nfuck man\nVoldemort is depressed\nAnd his poor dementors don't even know WHAT the fuck just happened. Voldy just stood there. Actually, he sat. Cause he liked to meditate. \nFukn weird ass motherfucker.\nso.\nVoldy sat on his nice little pedestal and opened his eyes one last time. It was a stormy day in this dark place. Legends say God experiences times as if 1 day is 1000 years and 1000 years is a day. But fukn Voldermort? Time doesn't exisit. Because he's as old as the stars and watches them burn. He's not the Grim Reaper.\nHe just sits. Like a weird person. With his 3 arms (maybe 4 idk that guy IS pretty weird) and.\nOn the sad day when the universe ended and all the stars had burned out. Voldemort shed a single tear and smiled\nfor the first time in 1,000,556,223 years. And it was his birthday which was pretty cool. Fukn Stalin and Hitler can go live in a fukn fantasy. Voldemort..?\nman.........................\n\nAnd then, after this momentous day...after the universe ended.\nIt rained a different kind of rain.\nYou could smell it in the air. And it was brown. Yup. You guessed it. Roosters. Because Voldemort loved cockroaches\nbecause they reminded him of being Fucked in the ass by Saddam Hussein. *cough* i mean, roosters.\n\ntldr: and is very depressed.",

I noticed that I was missing a receipt that I might need later, so, mumbling under my breath, I retraced my steps to the mall entrance.\n\nAs I was searching the wet pavement for the lost receipt, I heard a quiet sobbing. The crying was coming from a poorly dressed boy about 12 years old. He was short and thin, and had no coat. He was just wearing a ragged flannel shirt to protect him from the cold night's chill. Oddly enough, he was holding a hundred dollar bill in his hand. Thinking that he had gotten lost from his parents, I asked him what was wrong.\n\nHe told me his sad story. He said that he came from a large family. He had three brothers and two sisters. His father had died when he was nine years old. His mother was poorly educated and worked two full time jobs. She made very little to support her large family. Nevertheless, she had managed to save two hundred dollars to buy her children Christmas presents. The young boy had been dropped off on the way to her second job. He was to use the money to buy presents for all his siblings and save just enough to take the bus home.\nHe had not even entered the mall, when an older boy grabbed one of the hundred dollar bills and disappeared into the night.\n\n\"Why didn't you scream for help?\" I asked. \n\nThe boy said, \"I did.\" \n\n\"And nobody came to help you?\" I wondered. The boy stared at the sidewalk and sadly shook his head. \n\n\"How loud did you scream?\" I inquired. The soft-spoken boy looked up and meekly whispered, \"Help me!\"\n\nI realized that absolutely no one could have heard that poor boy cry for help.\nSo, I grabbed his other hundred and ran to my car.",

Their conclusion was the Japanese had 8 people rowing and 1 person steering, while the North American team had 8 people steering and 1 person rowing. So, North American management hired a consulting company and paid them a large amount of money for a second opinion.\n\nThey advised that too many people were steering the boat, while not enough people were rowing.\n\nTo prevent another loss to the Japanese, the rowing team\u2019s management structure was totally reorganized to 4 steering supervisors, 3 area steering superintendents and 1 assistant superintendent steering manager. They also implemented a new performance system that would give the 1 person rowing the boat greater incentive to work harder.\n\nIt was called the\u201dRowing Team Quality First Program\u201c, with meetings, dinners and free pens for the rower. There was discussion of getting new paddles, canoes and other equipment, extra vacation days for practices, and bonuses.\n\nThe next year the Japanese won by two miles. Humiliated, the North American management laid off the rower for poor performance, halted development of a new canoe, sold the paddles, and canceled all capital investments in new equipment. The money saved was distributed to the Senior Executives as bonuses and the next year\u2019s racing team was outsourced to India.",

Inside the room you will find your wife sitting in a chair... we need you to kill her' The man said, 'You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife.' The agent said, 'Then you're not the right man for this job. Take your wife and go home.' The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. The man came out with tears in his eyes, 'I tried, but I can't kill my wife.' The agent said, 'You don't have what it takes. Take your wife home.' Finally, the last man was given the same instructions, to kill his wife. He took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the man, wiping the sweat from his brow. 'Some idiot loaded the gun with blanks' he said. 'I had to strangle that bitch to death'.",

He'll be gone for over five years but the pay is great so he thinks it's well worth it and manages to be upbeat during his trip.\n\nWhen he gets to the small town, he unpacks his things at the lodge and then heads down to the mill for his first day of work.\n\nAfter he's done for the day, he asks his supervisor if there's any kind of entertainment around town. He says, \"there's a tavern where all the men get together at the end of work. Can't miss it buddy.\"\n\nSo he heads there. When he gets inside, he sees all the boys are having a good time, drinking up after a day's hard work. He goes to the bartender and orders one up for himself. He looks around: some men are playing billiards, others are watching the hockey game, and a few are playing cards. He thinks this is good and all, until it dawns on him: this is a fucking sausage fest. Not a single woman in sight. In fact, he's sure he's not seen a single piece of pussy since he got here. He begins to chat with the bartender about this.\n\n\"Hey there, it looks like you've been here for a long time. You wouldn't by any chance know how the men satisfy themselves around here, would you?\"\n\nBartender looks at him and says, \"Oh you're the new guy eh? Don't worry friend, the guys have thought all this out a long time ago. Now listen up, I only wanna tell you this once. Every Tuesday at midnight, there's this big ass truck that comes around town for this very purpose. And you know what? Today is Tuesday and you're in luck!\"\n\nThe guy is obviously excited. He hasn't had any since he got here. He looks at the clock and it's a couple hours away. He waits eagerly. When the clock strikes for midnight, he begins to get up, but is beaten soundly by a stampede of men making their way to the exit as the distant sound of a truck horn is heard. He finally heads out after everyone but the bartender have left.\n\nOutside, upon seeing what is taking place, the lumberjack is suddenly overwhelmed by a deep sense of disgust. A big ass truck has arrived, but its cargo consists of moose - some bulls, some cows - and the men were fucking the living shit out of them. Clearly horrified by what he's seeing, the lumberjack blurts out, \"What the fuck is this? This is the most digusting shit I've ever seen in my life!\" but none of the men even pay attention to him.\n\nThe bartender tells him, \"You're new here, can't say I blame you. These ones haven't had any for just under a month now. You'll soon give up.\"\n\nLumberjack looks at him, still mortified, \"You can't be serious! There's no way I'm fucking a moose!\"\n\nBartender rolls his eyes and says, \"We shall see.\"\n\nSo he heads back to his lodge. One day goes by; easy enough, he thinks to himself. Then a week goes by; he's starting to lose it, he's fapped so much that he ran out of paper to wipe his ass. On the second week, he's desperate and has come to terms that fucking a moose is acceptable given the predicament he's in. It's a Tuesday, so he heads to the tavern after work.\n\nHe goes up to the bartender and orders the strongest stuff available. Bartender looks at him and merely nods as their eyes meet. He waits like all the others. The lumberjack is no longer ashamed. When the clock hits midnight, the man has already made his way to the door, leaving all the others in the dust.\n\nOutside, the lumberjack takes everything off and begins to smash the first piece of moose he happens to grab a hold of. He's pounding the fuck out of the moose, thrusting profusely in a confluence of rage and pleasure, the animal only able to stand idly by without flinching. Finally, he unloads, and it's the most satisfying hump of his life.\n\nHe begins to look around but sees that none of the others has joined in the act. Looking back, he notices that the rest of the men are just staring at him with perplexed looks. Lumberjack is worried he's done something wrong. But he remains cool, turns back and addresses the other:\n\n\"Hey, why aren't any of you up here fucking a moose? I've seen you all do it before, what's wrong?\"\n\nA voice in the crowd says, \"Buddy, that's the ugliest moose I've ever seen!\"",

The mountains to the north and the river to the south both necessitate that we build the railroad exactly here, right through where you are currently living. We hope you understand and will move your tribe so there will be no bloodshed.\u201d \u201cBowels no move,\u201d replied the Chief. \n\nThe engineers, although taken aback and disappointed, decided to return a week later to give the Chief time to reconsider his decision to not move his tribe and allow the railroad to be built. Meeting again at the Chief\u2019s teepee, the engineers discussed with the Chief. \n\n\u201cSir, it has been a week since we last met. Have you changed your decision? Will you let us build our railroad here?\u201d Having not changed his mind, the Chief again replied, \u201cBowels no move.\u201d \u201cSir, we have orders from the President of the United States himself to build a railroad here\u201d the engineers agitatedly replied.  \u201cIf you do not let us build the railroad through this land, we shall be required to forcibly move your tribe.\u201d \u201cBowels. No. Move.\u201d insisted the Chief. \u201cFine. We will give you one more week. And upon our return, if you do not agree to our demands that you move your tribe, we shall forcibly remove you from his land.\u201d\n\nAnother week passes. The engineers, now desperate to have the Chief agree to their demands so as to fall no farther behind schedule, meet the Chief again at the fire in the middle of the teepee village. \u201cSir, another week has passed. We do not wish to use force, but we shall do so if necessary. Will you move your tribe and let us build our railroad here?\u201d \u201cBowels move,\u201d agreed the Chief. Overjoyed, the engineers inquired as to what changed the Chief\u2019s mind. The Chief replied, \u201cBowels move,\u201d and then paused. \u201cTeepee full of poo-poo.\u201d",

He looked at the pig and said \"Yeah I fancy the pig, I could fuck the pig!\" \nHowever when he approaches the pig the dog jumps in his way snarling and snapping at him, blocking him from getting close to the pig.\n\"Damn it,\" says the man and he retreats to his shelter, his lust defeated. \nLife goes on as normal for a while, he climbs trees, breaks cocunuts and swims in the sea. Then a few weeks later the man gets the horn again.\nHe looks at the dog, \"nah I don't fancy the dog,\" he says. He looks at the pig and \"Yeah, I fancy the pig, I could do the pig!\" He tries again to fuck the pig.\nBut again the dog jumps to the pigs defense, snarling and biting,  not letting the man near the pig.\n\"Fuck it, bloody dog,\" says the man and retires to his shelter, his lust defeated.\nHe goes on for a few weeks  much as before living the simple life, he creates fire, improves his shelter and smashes rocks for fun. Then once again comes the unstoppable urge. \nThe man looks at the dog \"Nah I don't fancy the dog,\" he says.\nHe looks at the pig, \"yes I fancy the pig, i could do the pig,\" he says, and once again he tries to fuck the pig.\nHowever again the dog jumps to the defense of the pig, gnashing and snarling and the man is beaten and returns to his shelter his lust defeated. \nA few days later he's walking along the beach when to his surprise he discovers the body of a young woman. He pulls her out of the sea and carries her to his shelter.She's unconscious at first but he feeds her and gives her water and after a week she is nursed back to health.\n\"You know you really helped me,\" says the woman.\n\"Really?\" said the man.\n\"Yes, without you I would have died on that beach,\" she said.\n\"So infact I owe you my life.\"\nThen.... suggestively touching her swimsuit she says \"You've been stuck on this island a time right? It must get lonely here? Is there any thing I can do for you?\"\n\"Well,\"says the man after some consideration. \" There is one thing............\n\nCan you take the dog for a walk!\"",

I assumed the position, face between his legs n pantied ass up for his friend. I'm getting into the cock in my mouth when I feel my panties being removed and a lubed up hand rubbing my hole. I'll admit this was a bit fast for me but I let it happen lol next thing ik the friend is sliding on a condom and then I felt it. he really had to force it in and the pressure/pain was almost unbearable, I nearly bit down on the cock in my mouth lol. once his huge head pushed through the rest slid in and I felt his big cock deep in me, I was very proud n let out a nice moan. after that they tore me up lol regular fucked my throat nice and hard making me gag like crazy and his friend pounded my poor little butt lol. I did eventually tap out because it hurt super bad after a while but he did give me the best sissy orgasm ever ;) ended up with a load down my throat and a hot massive load all over my booty ;) soo happy I got torn up, can't wait to let my regular in me next time. thanks for reading ladies :*",

Johnny locked his keys in the car yesterday. We were really worried because it took him two hours to get me and your daddy out.\n\nYour sister had a baby this morning, but I haven't found out what it is yet so I don't know if you're an aunt or an uncle. The baby looks just like your brother. Uncle Ted fell in a whiskey vat last week. Some men tried to pull him out, but he fought them off playfully and drowned.

Finally, Washington grabbed Corporal Peters (remember this name) and stationed him at the front of the boat with a lantern.\nHe ordered him to keep swinging it, so they could see where they were heading.\nCorporal Peters, through driving rain and cold, continued swinging the lantern back and forth, back and forth.\nThen a big gust of wind and a wave hit and threw Corporal Peters and his lantern into the Delaware .\nWashington and his troops searched for nearly an hour trying to find Corporal Peters, but to no avail.\nAll of them felt terrible, for the Corporal had been one of their favorites. Sometime later, Washington and his troops landed on the other side, wet and totally exhausted.\nHe rallied the troops and told them that they must go on. Another hour later, one of his men said, \u2018General, I see lights ahead.\u2019\nSo they trudged toward the lights and came upon a huge house. What they didn\u2019t know, was that this was a house of ill repute hidden in the forest to serve all who came.\nGeneral Washington pounded on the door, his men crowding around him. The door swung open, and much to his surprise stood a beautiful woman. A huge smile came across her face, to see so many men standing there.\nWashington was the first to speak, \u2018Madam, I am General George Washington and these are my men. We are tired, wet, exhausted, and desperately need warmth and comfort.\u2019\nAgain, the Madam looked at all the men standing there, and with a broad smile on her face, said, \u2018Well, General, you have come to the right place. We can surely give you warmth and comfort. How many men do you have?\u2019\nWashington replied, \u2018Well, Madam, there are 32 of us without Peters.\u2019\nAnd the Madam said, \u2018You gotta be shittin\u2019 me.",

        "body": "Once upon a time - which is a terrible way to start a joke - there was a little boy named Billy. \n\nBilly was six years old, and for the whole of his short life, he had been utterly and intensely obsessed with clowns. He had clown bed sheets and clown posters; he had clown toys and clown-themed games; he had towels with clowns on them, a toothbrush in the shape of a clown, and - if it had existed - he probably would have used clown-flavored toothpaste, as well.\n\nTry not to think about it.\n\nThe point here is that Billy loved clowns, and his parents were well aware of that fact. (They'd have to be, right? I mean, how is a six-year-old going to buy all of that stuff?) Thus, they decided that for their son's seventh birthday, they'd purchase front row seats at the circus, which *just happened* to be in town at the same time. Upon hearing this, Billy was absolutely overcome with excitement, and he was scarcely able to sit still until his family arrived at the big top.\n\nBilly and his parents walked in, took their seats, and waited for the show to start. \n\nThe music flared to life and the lights came up, and in a dazzling display of merriment, everything began. First came the lion-tamers with their whips and chairs... and yeah, they were intriguing, but they didn't hold Billy's interest. Next came the feats of strength with strongmen (and one excessively suspicious woman) smashing bricks and bending bars... and yeah, it was impressive, but Billy didn't really care. The sword swallowers followed, and the trapeze artists, and the tightrope walkers... and yeah, someone might have died at any moment, but it all seemed so *boring*.\n\nEventually, Billy began to worry that he wouldn't get to see clowns at the circus. After all, he knew very well that clowns usually only appeared when something went wrong. (You didn't know that, did you? Yeah, clowns are typically kept on standby in case someone screws up.) \n\nSuddenly, all of the lights went out.\n\nA single spotlight shown down to one corner of the arena.\n\nA tiny car came puttering into view, while discordant, almost forlorn circus music played.\n\n*Deet deet deedle-deedle deet deet dee deeeeee...*\n\nThe car's doors sprang open, and out poured the most amazing collection of clowns that Billy had ever seen! There were fat clowns, thin clowns, tall clowns, short clowns! Clowns with bright red hair and enormous red noses! Clowns in silly suspenders and oversize shoes! There were clowns wearing every color of the rainbow, and clowns that moved like psychotic ferrets on speed! There were more clowns than Billy had ever *dreamed* of watching all at once!\n\nThen, just as it seemed like that tiny car couldn't produce a single soul more, another clown stepped out. He was too fat to be thin, yet too thin to be fat... but somehow wasn't average, either. He was too short too be tall, yet too tall to be short... but still managed to be both at once. He had pale, almost white skin - not the product of makeup - and deep, almost black, sunken eyes. He had a shock of bright red (and completely natural) hair, and a bulbous, equally red nose.\n\nBilly looked on with awe and wonder as he realized what he was seeing: This wasn't a person in makeup who was putting on an act; this was a *real clown*. The man - if indeed you could call him a man - reached into the front of his pants, wiggled his hand around for a little while, and pulled forth a bright silver microphone. After offering a conspiratorial wink to the audience, the clown cleared his throat... and his dry, raspy voice boomed out for everyone to hear:\n\n\"I need a volunteer!\"\n\n**[Continued](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3wmv58/the_clown_joke_warning_very_long/cxxdzc6)**...",

He swerved to avoid hitting the Bunny, but unfortunately the rabbit jumped in front of his car and was hit. The basket of eggs went flying all over the place.\n\nThe driver, being a sensitive man as well as an animal lover, pulled over to the side of the road, and got out to see what had become of the Bunny carrying the basket. Much to his dismay, the colorful Bunny was dead. The driver felt guilty and began to cry.\n\nA woman driving down the same highway saw the man crying on the side of the road and pulled over. She stepped out of her car and asked the man what was wrong.\n\n\u201cI feel terrible,\u201d he explained, \u201cI accidentally hit the Easter Bunny and killed it. There may not be an Easter because of me. What should I do?\u201d\n\nThe woman told the man not to worry. She knew exactly what to do. She went to her car trunk, and pulled out a spray can. She walked over to the limp, dead Bunny, and sprayed the entire contents of the can onto the little furry animal. Miraculously the Easter Bunny came back to life, jumped up, picked up the spilled eggs and candy, waved its paw at the two humans and hopped on down the road. 50 yards away the Easter Bunny stopped, turned around, waved and hopped on down the road another 50 yards, turned, waved, hopped another 50 yards and waved again!\n\nThe man was astonished. He said to the woman, \u201cWhat in heaven\u2019s name is in your spray can? What was it that you sprayed on the Easter Bunny?\u201d\n\nThe woman turned the can around so that the man could read the label. It said:\u00a0\n\u201cHair spray. Restores life to dead hair.

But oxygen is highly reactive, and at first, its effect on evolution was so negative that some have named this period the \u201coxygen catastrophe.\u201d However, as oxygen gradually formed a protective ozone layer, life rebounded. After the first organisms evolved to use oxygen to their advantage, the diversity of aerobic organisms exploded. According to the Theory of Endosymbiosis, engulfing of some of these aerobic bacteria led to eukaryotic cells with mitochondria, and multicellularity, the evolution of multicellular eukaryotic organisms, followed. Today, we live in an atmosphere which is 21% oxygen, and most of life follows glycolysis with the last two, aerobic stages of cellular respiration.\nRecall the purpose of cellular respiration: to release energy from glucose to make ATP, the universal molecule of energy for cellular work. The following equation describes the overall process, although it summarizes many individual chemical reactions.\n \n[Figure3]\nOnce again, the first stage of this process, glycolysis, is ancient, universal, and anaerobic. In the cytoplasm of most cells, glycolysis breaks each 6-carbon molecule of glucose into two 3-carbon molecules of pyruvate. Chemical energy, which had been stored in the now broken bonds, is transferred to 2 ATP and 2 NADH molecules.\nThe fate of pyruvate depends on the species and the presence or absence of oxygen. If oxygen is present to drive subsequent reactions, pruvate enters the mitochondrion, where the Krebs Cycle (Stage 2) and electron transport chain (Stage 3) break it down and oxidize it completely to CO2 and H2O. The energy released builds many more ATP molecules, though of course some is lost as heat. Let\u2019s explore the details of how mitochondria use oxygen to make more ATP from glucose by aerobic respiration.\n\n**That's what she said**",

Ever since the only income for this family was a lone dairy cow; which was milked daily. On one morning the mother went out to milk said cow only to find that it was laying dead in the pasture. She fell to her knees and began to cry uncontrollably. Shortly thereafter a mermaid arose from the ocean and tried to console her. She asked \"Why are you crying my dear?\" in which the mother replied \"Our cow, our only source of income is dead. My family will surely starve!\" the mermaid replied \"I happen to know that you have three handsome sons. Mother I will make a deal with you. If your oldest son can fuck me more than 15 times I will bring your cow back to life.\" So the mother goes and fetches her eldest son who is 17 years old and explains the situation to him. he replies \"Of course mother, I will do this for the sake of the family!\" Well after 13 times the son drops dead from exhaustion. The mermaid feeling sympathetic tells the mother \"If your middle son can fuck me more than 10 times I will bring your cow back to life.\" so the mother grabs the next eldest who is 15 and explains the situation. He agrees to fuck the mermaid, however dies after 8 times from exhaustion. Still feeling sympathetic the mermaid tells the mother that if her youngest son can fuck her more than 5 times she'll bring the cow back to life. The mother fetches her 12 year old and explains whats going on. At this point the 12 year old turns to the mermaid and replies \"Nahhhh lets make it 20 times!!\" as to which the mermaid is taken aback in disbelief. Shes questions his judgement but agrees to 20. After a few days the boy arises from the field from fucking her non stop, the mermaid herself almost dead with exhaustion rolls over and asks \"How did you learn to fuck like that?!?!!?\" as to which the boy replies \"How do you think the cow died?\" ",

        "body": "I was travelling through the Himalayan mountains when I stumbled across a monastery. I was tired after a long day of travel, so I decided to enter in, and perhaps pay the monks for some food, and water, and a place to stay for the night. To my surprise, when they welcomed me in, they refused to take my money, and gave me all the food I could eat, all the wine I could drink, and the most comfortable bed I have ever rested on. When I awoke, my gear had been replaced by top-quality stuff, easily worth ten times what my own gear had been worth, and loaded down with provisions. I asked them how they could afford to do this for me, and they pointed at an archway above a door, inscribed with symbols that resembled no language that I knew. They said, \"We merely follow the words inscribed on the arch, and all is provided for us, and our guests.\"\n\nI asked, \"So, what do the words say?\"\n\nThey replied, \"Sorry, we can't tell you, you're not a monk.\"\nI left that day, and the gear kept me cool in the warmth, warm when it was cool, it repelled all water, and it seemed lighter than should be possible. I checked the Internet, and could find no record of these kinds of materials, and no record of the monastery, either. I decided that I had to know their secret, so I made my way back to the Himalayas,and, after a few weeks of searching, found the monastery again.\n\nThey welcomed me with in the same style as the last time, and the food and drink were even better this time! I asked them what I would have to do to become a monk, and to learn their secret. They pointed me through the archway, saying that I must go to the far end of the cavern, and when I reached the end, all would be revealed to me. Anything I needed to cross would be provided for me, but I would have to come back and ask for it.\n\nSo, I entered the cavern, and ascended a long stairway up. No sooner had I reached the top of that stairway than there was another long stairway going down! Then, at the bottom of that stairway was another long stairway going up, then another stairway going down, then another stairway going up, and one more going down. I was lucky to still be wearing the clothing and boots that the monks had provided for me, because at this point, I was sore, and exhausted, and sweaty: I don't know how bad it would be if I was wearing normal clothing.\n\nAt the bottom of this stairway was a lake, stretching as far as the eye could see. I felt the water, and it was ice cold: no way I could swim it. I would have to go back and get a boat.\n\nSo I went up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and arrived, exhausted, back at the monastery. They fed me, and clothed me, and I rested.\n\nThe next day, I asked them for a canoe and a paddle, which they kindly provided, but they told me, \"You must bring everything back each time that you return.\"\n\nSo I picked up the canoe and paddle, and carried them up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and paddled across the lake. On the other side of the lake was another stairway going up, so I continued, and found that they conformed to the same pattern as before: three staircases up, and three down. So, I went up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and then I came to a top of a tall, completely smooth wall. There was no way that I could jump down and survive, and certainly no way that I could climb back up, so I had to go back for a rope: there was even already a place to anchor it.\n\nSo, I went up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and crossed the lake in the canoe, and carried the canoe and paddle up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and arrived, even more ehausted this time, back at the monastery. They fed me, and clothed me, and I rested.\n\nThe next day, I asked them for a rope, a canoe, and a paddle, which they kindly provided, but they told me, \"You must bring everything back each time that you return.\"\nSo I picked up the rope, canoe and paddle, and carried them up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and paddled across the lake. I then carried the rope up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs.\n\nI tied off the rope to the anchor, and descended the rope down to the base of the wall. I found myself at the base of another foot of stairs, and, you guessed it, it was the same pattern. So, I went up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and at the foot of these stairs, I found a huge chasm. There was a drawbridge on the other side that could swing down to span it, and there was a mechanism on this side to lower it, but a key pin which allowed the mechanism to function was missing - the winch would turn, but the drawbridge would not swing down.\n\nSo, I went up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and climbed up the rope. I untied the rope, and carried it up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and crossed the lake in the canoe, and carried the rope and canoe and paddle up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and arrived, absolutely exhausted to every fiber of my bones this time, back at the monastery. They fed me, and clothed me, and I rested.\n\nThe next day, I asked them for a pin for the winch, a rope, a canoe, and a paddle, which they kindly provided, but they told me, \"You must bring everything back each time that you return.\"\n\nSo I picked up the pin, rope, canoe and paddle, and carried them up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and paddled across the lake. I then carried the pin and rope up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs. I tied the rope off and descended, and carried the pin up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up hte stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs.\n\nI fitted the pin into the drawbridge's mechanism, lowered the draw bridge, locked it into place, and crossed. On the other side of the bridge was more stairs! So, I went up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and found myself at the end, finally, of the cavern, and there was a great orb. I touched the orb, and I suddenly knew that if I saw the archway again, I would be able to read it, and I would know the secret of the monks.\n\nSo, I went up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and raised the drawbridge, and removed the pin. I carried the pin up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and climbed up the rope. I untied the rope, and carried the pin and the rope up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and crossed the lake in the canoe. I carried the pin and rope and canoe and paddle up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and up the stairs, and down the stairs, and arrived, on death's very door, back at the monastery.\n\nI looked up at the archway, and understood its message, and I was suddenly rejuvenated, made whole. To this day, I have lived by the words on that archway, and everything has been provided for me.\n\nSo, do you want to know what the words on the archway are?\n\nSorry, I can't tell you: you're not a monk.\n\n-----\n\nOP: /u/Nimelennar",

His mother attempted suicide via hanging herself but he 'slipped out' of her corpse and was saved by his umbilical chord sorta making him bungee jump. A Catholic priest found him with his mother's corpse and adopted him. He originally something luck related, but because of his birth, he believed that his death was God willed and that he was meant for great things which lead to him changing his name to something more religious. \n\n Anyways, we went to a missionary together in Africa and he decided to go down to a nearby village. When he was there he saw that the villagers were being mistreated by another tribe (could've been a gang). One day, he saw them hack up a kid in the streets with a long blade so he followed them back to their hideout. It was an all wood building with some sorta drug deal inside. \n\n He hated these men for what they did to that poor child, so he threw a makeshift Molotov cocktail into the center of the building, right next to some sorta crate. He doesn't know what was in that crate, but I'll tell ya, it must have been flammable because I flames all the way from the mission. He was never quite the same since that event. When we got home I thought he was lifeless (he almost completely blanked out), but truth was, he was happy. *Really* happy. \n\n He started going out at night more and talked to some questionable people. When I finally confronted him about it he revealed he's been tracking down people related to the same tribe/gang and burning them down in the name of righteous justice. He said there was only one more location left and he asked if I wanted to help burn those bastards to the ground. I refused, burning down other people's stuff was *not* on my to-do list. We had a little spat about it, but in the end he went off to do it by himself. The next day on the news, they said that a ware house exploded near downtown. \n\n Apparently, there was some sorta illegal bomb making ring down their and someone decided to literally heat things up. They found several charred bodies, all identified as known convicts from Africa, but one was out of the ordinary, being of Spanish decent. It was at that moment I realized: Jesus died for arson.\n",

Now Charlie was the friendliest street conductor that the city has ever seen. Not only did he never complain about his job, but also he greeted everyone who boarded his street car and treated them like family.  \n\n Everything in his life was perfect for Charlie until one day he decided to operate the street car after having a few drinks. In his drunken state, he crashed the streetcar and killed all the passengers. After going to court Charlie was sentenced to death by the electric chair.  \n\n When the day came for his execution, a guard visited Charlie's cell and asked him what he wanted for his final meal. Charlie replied, \"I want a rotten tomato and a raw fish.\" After Charlie finished his meal he headed into the execution room and sat down in the electric chair. The warden gave the order to pull the switch and the room went dark as thousands of volts passed through Charlies body.   \n\nAfter the switch was thrown back it came as a surprise that Charlie was in fact still alive. Having no idea what else to do the warden let Charlie out of jail but banned him from ever operating a streetcar in New Orleans. Since street cars were his life Charlie decided \"Hey I'll go to Japan, I hear they have fancy new street cars there.\" In Japan Charlie gets a job as a conductor again, but as before decides that after having a few drinks that he is still able to work the street car.   \n\nTo no surprise Charlie crashes the street car and kills all the passengers. Charlie again finds himself in jail ordering his last meal. \"A rotten tomato and a raw fish,\" he tells the guard. After the meal was eaten, Charlie was led to the chair and once again survived the electricity. Because he didn't die, he was set free, but banned from operating the street cars in Japan.    \n\nSo Charlie thought to himself, \"Well I heard San Francisco still has street cars operating so I'll go there.\" As you can guess Charlie ends up in the same situation and again orders the same meal \" A rotten tomato and a raw fish,\" he tells the guard.  \n\n Well, the warden from San Francisco had heard of Charlie and his previous death sentences so before he brought Charlie in to be executed he sent a letter to the mayor asking to reroute the city's electricity to the jail. The mayor approved and confident with his new found power the warden smiled and gave the order to pull the switch. The lights in the room burst from the overload and the smell of something burning overwhelmed the air. After a minute, the warden ordered the guard to shut off the chair, and as the smoke cleared, there was Charlie same as always.   \n\nDistraught with emotion, the warden told Charlie to get out of his sights. Charlie, tired of going to jail, finally decided that maybe he shouldn't be a street car conductor after all. So Charlie traveled back to New Orleans and met his friend Thibodeaux at a bar. Thibodeaux after a few minutes of small talk tells Charlie: \"Everyone has heard about the electric chair incidents and I just gotta ask, how were you able to survive all them jolts of electricity through your body, was there something you did that made you resistant to it?\"   \n\nCharlie looks at Thibodeaux and says \"I dunno, I guess I was just a bad conductor.\"\n\n\nIf you're gonna repost, repost worth a damn. \n",

        "body": "went grocery shopping recently while not being altogether sure that course of action was a wise one. You see, the previous evening I had prepared and consumed a massive quantity of my patented 'You're definitely going to Shit yourself' chili. Tasty stuff, albeit hot to the point of being painful, which comes with a written guarantee from me that if you eat the next day both of your butt cheeks WILL fall off.\n\nHere's the thing. I had awakened that morning, and even after two cups of coffee (and all of you know what I mean) nothing happened. No 'Watson's Movement 2'. Despite habanera peppers swimming their way through my intestinal tract, I appeared to be unable to create the usual morning symphony referred to by my next door neighbors as thunder and lightning.\n\nKnowing that a time of reckoning had to come, yet not sure of just when, I bravely set off for the market, a local Walmart grocery store that I often haunt in search of tasty tidbits.\n\nUpon entering the store at first all seemed normal. I selected a cart and began pushing it about dropping items in for purchase. It wasn't until I was at the opposite end of the store from the restrooms that the pain hit me. Oh, don't look at me like you don't know what I'm talking about. I'm referring to that 'Uh oh, gotta go' pain that always seems to hit us at the wrong time. The thing is, this pain was different.\n\nThe habaneras in the chili from the night before were staging a revolt. In a mad rush for freedom they bullied their way through the small intestines, forcing their way into the large intestines, and before I could take one step in the direction of the restrooms which would bring sweet relief, it happened. The peppers fired a warning shot.\n\nThere I stood, alone in the spice and baking aisle, suddenly enveloped in a noxious cloud the likes of which has never before been recorded. I was afraid to move for fear that more of this vile odor might escape me. Slowly, oh so slowly, the pressure seemed to leave the lower part of my body, and I began to move up the aisle and out of it, just as an elderly\nwoman turned into it.\n\nI don't know what made me do it, but I stopped to see what her reaction would be to the malodorous effluvium that refused to dissipate, as she walked into it unsuspecting. Have you ever been torn in two different directions emotionally? Here's what I mean, and I'm sure some of you at least will be able to relate.\n\nI could've warned that poor woman but didn't. I simply watched as she walked into an invisible, and apparently indestructible, wall of odor so terrible that all she could do before gathering her senses and running, was to stand there blinking and waving her arms about her head as though trying to ward off angry bees. This, of course, made me feel terrible, but then made me laugh. Mistake.\n\nHere's the thing. When you laugh, it's hard to keep things 'clamped down', if you know what I mean. With each new guffaw an explosive issue burst forth from my nether region. Some were so loud and echoing that I was later told a few folks in other aisles had ducked, fearing that someone was robbing the store and firing off a shotgun.\n\nSuddenly things were no longer funny. It was coming, and I raced off through the store towards the restrooms, laying down a cloud the whole way, praying that I'd make it before the grand mal assplosion took place.\n\nLuck was on my side. Just in the nick of time I got to the john, began the inevitable 'Oh my God', floating above the toilet seat because my ass is burning SO BAD, purging. One poor fellow walked in while I was in the middle of what is the true meaning of 'Shock and Awe'. He made a gagging sound, and disgustedly said, 'Sonavabitch' and quickly left.\n\nOnce finished I left the restroom, reacquired my partially filled cart intending to carry on with my shopping when a store employee approached me and said, 'Sir, you might want to step outside for a few minutes. It appears some prankster set off a stink bomb in the store. The manager is going to run the vent fans on high for a minute or two which ought to take care of the problem.'\n\nThat of course set me off again, causing residual gases to escape me. The employee took one sniff, jumped back pulling his shirt up to cover his nose and, pointing at me in an accusing manner shouted, 'IT'S YOU!', then ran off returning moments later with the manager.\n\nI was unceremoniously escorted from the premises and asked none too kindly not to return.\n\nHome again without having shopped, I realized that there was nothing to eat but leftover chili, so I consumed two more bowls. The next day I went to shop at Albertson's. I can't say anymore about that because we are in court over the whole matter. Bastards claim they're going to have to repaint the store.",

Standing outside the bar was a nun holding a tin cup.\n\nAs the man threw a few bucks into her cup the nun launched into a long tirade about the evils of alcohol. She went on and on about how alcohol was tearing apart the fabric of society and how it was the root of all the city's problems.\n\nSlightly pissed off at having to listen to this the guy said, \"Listen sister, I work hard for my money and sometimes at the end of a long day I like a drink or two. That doesn't make me a bad person. I have a wife I idolize and two wonderful kids at home. I provide for my family, I volunteer my time to several local service clubs and I contribute regularly to various charities. Yet you stand here and condemn me just because I drink the occasional glass of scotch!\"\n\nThe nun was slightly taken aback and replied, \"I see your point my son and I apologize if I offended you but the alcohol is such a powerful demon that all who consume it are doomed...\"\n\n\"Look there you go again,\" said the man, \"How can you make such a sweeping statement. Have you ever even TRIED alcohol?\"\n\n\"Of course not!\" gasped the nun, \"The evil alcohol has never touched my lips.\"\n\n\"Do you really think that one glass of booze can change you from a devout nun to some kind of evil degenerate?\"\n\n\"Well, I really don't know....\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what, come into the bar with me and I'll buy you a drink. One drink. I'll prove to you that \"evil\" is not inside the glass, it's inside the person.\"\n\n\"Oh I could never be seen going into such a den of inequity, it's out of the question.\n\nHowever, your comment about evil residing in the person rather than the glass is quite intriguing. I must admit you've aroused a curiosity in me.\"\n\n\"Well let's go inside and settle this\"\n\n\"No my son, I could never enter such a place... but how about this. Take my tin cup with you and fill it with this \"scotch\" you mentioned. Bring it out to me and I'll try it.\"\n\n\"You're on!\" said the guy.\n\nThe nun removed all the change and handed him the tin cup. He went into the bar and said to the bartender, \"Two scotch on the rocks, and could you put one of them in this tin cup please\"\n\nThe bartender sighed and said, \"Is that frickin' nun out there again!\"",

Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he told his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared. Being a practical leader, several days later he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, \"Is the coming winter going to be cold?\" \"It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold,\" the meteorologist at the weather service responded. So the chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more firewood in order to be prepared. A week later he called the National Weather Service again. \"Does it still look like it is going to be a very cold winter?\" \"Yes,\" the man at National Weather Service again replied, \"it's going to be a very cold winter.\" The chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of firewood they could find. Two weeks later the chief called the National Weather Service again. \"Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?\" \"Absolutely,\" the man replied. \"It's looking more and more like it is going to be one of the coldest winters we've ever seen.\" \"How can you be so sure?\" the chief asked.

However, the parrot was being particularly difficult that night.  \n  \nThe magician held up an ordinary cloth, and with a flick of the wrist, it was gone. But as the crowd applauded, the parrot piped up and yelled \"IT'S IN HIS SLEEVE!\"  \n  \nAnnoyed, the magician placed his hat on a table. He began to wave his arms around, when the parrot yelled \"RABBIT UNDER THE TABLE!\"  \n  \nThe magician, hoping to get away from the parrot ruining his tricks, pulls out a deck of cards. Before he can even approach the crowd, the parrot yells \"EVERY CARD IS THE ACE OF SPADES!\"\n\nFurious that his show was ruined, the magician packed up his things and left the parrot behind on stage. That night, there was a horrible storm, and the cruise ship was torn apart. The magician managed to survive, but he was stuck on a piece of wood floating in the middle of the sea... and as luck would have it, his parrot came flying down and landed next to him.  \n\nFor hours, neither said anything, they just glared at each other. As the sun finally came up, the bird sighed and looked at the magician.\n \n\"Alright, I give up,\" the parrot said. \"What did you do with the ship?\"",

The first officer said, \"What does it say on the label?\" The other officer responded, \"It says pig.\"\n\nThe second thief was hiding in that same crate, so he said, \"Oink! Oink! Oink!\" The two officers nodded to each other: it was pig alright.\n\nThe third thief was very nervous, and he shifted about in his crate, causing the police officers to notice the movement.

        "body": "Question in the exam paper : \nIs Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?\n\nMost of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.\n\nOne student, however, wrote the following:\nFirst, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving, which is unlikely. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today.\n\nMost of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell.\nSince there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than any one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.\n\nThis gives two possibilities:\n\n1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.\n2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.\n\nSo which is it?\nIf we accept the postulate given to me by Anabella during my Freshman year that, 'It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,' and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct; leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night,\n\nAnabella kept shouting 'Oh my God.'\n\nHe got an A+.",

When the headaches strike the poor man can\u2019t work, he can\u2019t sleep, he can\u2019t bare light or sounds or even touch.  The poor guy sees doctor after doctor and tries every therapy from yoga to prescription pain killers . . . nothing helps.  \n\n\nFinally the man hears of special clinic in Switzerland.  He makes an appointment, flies to Switzerland, sees the doctor and gets examined up and down . . . they touch him, poke him, scan him . . . . they give him reflex tests and gagging tests and neurological tests and tests he has no idea what the purpose is.  Finally, the doctor comes to him and says, \u201cWe have good news and bad news.\u201d  The man, thinking he must have a brain tumor or cancer responds, \u201cJust tell me doc, what\u2019s the bad news?  How long do I got?\u201d    \n\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand,\u201d the doctor says, \u201cwe can cure your headaches.\u201d  \u201cYou can!\u201d the man exclaims, \u201cthat\u2019s the best news in the world!!\u201d  But the doctor goes on, \u201cto cure you, we need to castrate you.\u201d\n\n\nThe patient reflexively covers his genitals and says that he has to think about this.

Finally he calls the clinic and arranges for the procedure.  \n\nThe operation is a success.  The man recuperates in Switzerland for a few weeks and prepares to go home.  On his last day in the country he wanders into a small tailor shop and orders a custom suite to celebrate his new, pain free life.

Plus the petite stature of little boys makes for better maneuverability with the impish elves.\n\nHearing the dreaded hoof clops though,  the boy scurried from his bar seat with fear in his eyes and then jumps right into santa's lap.\n\nSanta with his cheeks reddened from almost a gallon of hard nog admonishes the conniving Krumpus. \"How dare you even begin to think of taking this handsome young boy Krumpus. This boy is special and too pure for your terrible plans.\" The boy's bravery returns, but foolishly because he does not know of Santa's true intentions. You see dear St Nick never could completely quell the appetite he acquired from his years as a Catholic priest before he changed careers to his current role. You can still see the insatiable hunger in Santa's faded and bloodshot blue eyes as his breathing becomes heavier and pants grow tighter.\n\nAfter witnessing the character of his companions, the Ghost of Christmas Present realizes the Ghost of Christmas Past wasn't exaggerating with his tales.

His parents constantly made fun of him and he always went up to his room and cried.\n\n So he was taking a walk through the streets and he saw a large sign that said in big letters, \"County Fair\".\n\nHe decides to go in and check it out; he has some money on him.\nHe walks around for a bit, and then he sees the Shirt Eating Contest.\n\nHe thought he might have a good shot at this; shirt eating has always been a hobby of his.\n\nHe signs up. It cost 5$. He sits down at a long table with about 10 seats. Each seat has a plate with 5 shirts neatly folded and stacked in front of it.\n\nEveryone sits down and the director yells, \"3! 2! 1! Eat!\" and he shoots a blank. And Johnny starts eating. And eating. And he's eating. He's eating fast. He's finishing his shirts before everyone else.\n\nHe's finished his fifth and last shirt before anyone else has finished their second. He starts running around and eating everyone else's shirts. And he wins!\n\nJohhny takes his prize and leaves. Before he gets far, he gets a tap on the shoulder. It's the director. \"You did great back there. What's your name?\" he asks\n\n\"Uh... my name's Johnny Moth.\"\n\n\"Well, I'd like you to participate in the Regional Shirt Eating Contest this Saturday right here. Are you interested?\" he asks Johnny.\n\n\"Oh... I suppose,\" Johnny replies.\n\n\"Great! I look forward to seeing you there.\" And with that, the director leaves.\n\nJohnny goes home and tells his parents what happened. They call him fat and Johnny goes up to his room and cries.\n\nSoon it's time for the contest. He prepares himself and goes to the area. He's the first there, so he decides to take a short walk around.\n\nThen he returns to his seat. Everyone else slowly comes in.\n\n\"Attention all contestants! There are two winners of this tournament. The winners are invited to the National Shirt Eating Contest on Thursday. The first two to finish their plate of 10 shirts wins! On your mark, get set, go!\" yells the director through a bullhorn, shooting a blank.\n\nAnd Johnny starts eating. And eating. And he's eating. He's eating fast. He's finishing his shirts before everyone else. He looks around. He's in the lead! He finishes way before everyone else.\n\nHe jumps around to everyone else's shirts after the second person wins. He eats a total of 48 shirts. He wins!\n\nEveryone congratulates him and he runs home with his trophy. The Nationals! It's a very big deal, and he's very good at eating shirts.\n\nHe tells his parents, they punch him and he goes up to his room and cries. \n\nThursday comes. His flight to Chicago is early in the morning.\n\nHe takes his bags and leaves for Chicago. He checks into his hotel and gets some rest before the big night. \n\nHe wakes up and starts exploring the city. While walking, he bumps into a much larger moth than he. \n\n\"Hey, watch it punk,\" says the moth.\n\n\"Oh... sorry,\" replies Johnny, continuing on his way.\n\n\"Hey, you're that Johnny Moth kid, right? The shirt guy?\" he asks.\n\n\"Um... yea,\" answers Johnny.\n\n\"My name is Freddy Mothinson, and I'm gonna kick your butt!\"\n\n\"Oh...\" murmurs Johnny, who continues to walk.\n\nSo it's now time for the contest. Everyone goes into the hotel ballroom at the table where 8 people sit in a circle. \n\n\"Welcome, champions, to the National Shirt Eating Contest! The two contestants to finish their 5 plates of 4 shirts will be invited to represent North America in the World Shirt Eating Contest. Ready, set, go!\" says the director, firing a blank.\n\nAnd Johnny starts eating. And eating. And he's eating. He's eating fast. He appears to be finishing his shirts before everyone else.\n\nHe looks over at Freddy. Freddy is mass consuming the shirts. He's winning by a landslide. He hurries up on his shirts. He gets second place without any fight.\n\nThe director congratulates the two on their performance. \n\n\"Hey, punk. Don't think you can stand a chance against me at the finals. I'm gonna kick your butt again!\"\n\n\"Ah...\" replies Johnny, who walks to his hotel room to get a good night's sleep.\n\nHe returns home the next day, to tell his parents what had happened. His parents fart on him, and he goes up to his room to cry. \n\nHe wakes up in the morning to find a letter on his doorstep.\n\n\"To: Johnny Moth. From: President Barack O'Motha.\n\nA letter from the president! This was huge.\n\nHe opened it and started reading.\n\n\"Dear Mr. Moth. I saw your performances in Chicago on the television, and I was amazed at how determined you were eating those shirts. I will be coming to Paris to see you eat shirt in person. We're rooting for you! Barack O'Motha.\"\n\nHe was very excited. Paris was in a week. He booked tickets, and went to sleep. He sleeps a lot.\n\nSix days passed and it's time to go to Paris. He says goodbye to his parents who throw things at him but they miss and Johnny runs while crying.\n\nHe gets to the airport, and boards the plane. Luckily for him, he's upgraded to First Class for free! \n\nHe takes his new seat, and finds out it is next to a very pretty lady.\n\n\"Uh... hello. I'm Johnny Moth. What's your name?\" he says with red cheeks.\n\n\"I'm Clara. Nice to meet you!\" she says, giggling.\n\nThey talk and flirt the entire plane ride, and Johnny finally gets the courage to ask her out.\n\n\"Um... do you want to have dinner on the Eiffel Tower at 7:30 after my contest?\" he asks while his cheeks have all his blood.\n\n\"Sure! I can't wait!\" she replies with a wink.\n\nThe plane lands and Johnny goes to his hotel for a good night's sleep. He wakes up, and it's his big day. \n\nHe explores Paris for the day, until it's 6:45. The contest is at 7:00. He hurries over to the park where the event is being held.\n\nHe sits down with the 7 others.\n\n\"Bonsoir, monsieurs. Today, we are happy to hold the World Finals for Eating Shirt. Of the 8 contestants, only one of you will claim victory. You must eat your 30 shirts before anyone else. 3, 2, 1, go!\" says the director, firing a cannon.\n\nJohnny and Freddy look at each other, and then dig in.\n\nAnd Johnny starts eating. And eating. And he's eating. He's eating fast. \n\nAnd Freddy starts eating. And eating. And he's eating. He's eating fast. He's finishing his shirts before everyone else.\n\nThey're tied, but both ahead of everyone else. Johnny wants to win, he knows that O'Motha and Clara are watching. \n\nBut Freddy is pulling ahead. He's ahead 17 shirts to 14. He's eating faster!\n\nAnd then Johnny thinks of his parents. What will they do if he wins? Nothing. NOTHING! The hatred is flowing through him. He eats vigorously. He's eating a shirt every 3 seconds. \n\nHe wins in a landslide.\n\nHe celebrates! He dances around, and Freddy slams his plates onto the floor and walks away.\n\nThe director congratulates him and the crowd cheers. O'Motha comes up and shakes his hand. He is given his award of 500,000 euros. \n\nHe stays for a bit, and checks his watch. 7:24. He runs as fast as he can to the Eiffel Tower. He gets to the top by 7:30, and is out of breath.\n\nBut Clara isn't there.\n\nShe's probably just a bit late, he thought. \n\nHe hangs around for about 10 minutes, but still no Clara.\n\nHe decides to look through the telescope to see the City of Love.\n\nHe sees a beautiful view. But then he looks into a restaurant. And what does he see?\n\nHe sees his lovely Clara having dinner with Freddy Mothinson.\n\nHe starts crying. He cries harder than he ever had before.\n\nAnd boy, have you ever seen a moth bawl.  ^^^^^^sorry^^not^^sorry\n\nwow thanks for the gold",

Now, this particular eatery was a staple in quaint little Derbychesterfolkshireville, and everyone who was anyone ate there. You see, King's Dining Hall made a rather ostentatious claim, namely, that they only used the very best ingredients in their cuisine. And I do mean the *very best*. So very best, in fact, that anyone who thought otherwise was to be given not only a full refund, but an extra \u00a350 000 as well. Obviously, such a claim was just *begging* to be disproved, and so multitudes of patrons attempted to do just that. Alas, to both their chagrin and satisfaction, not a one could.\n\nNow, it so happened that, one day, a portly, sweaty, greasy, yet well-dressed man came into the restaurant, came up to Josiah, and asked, \"Excuse me, but could you please get for me the owner of this establishment? I wish to speak to him.\" To which he replied, \"That would be me, sir.\"\n\n\"You must be joking!\"\n\n\"Yes, that's right.\"\n\nThe man was puzzled at first, but because this isn't an Abbot and Costello routine, he realized the discrepancy and continued: \"My name is Phil Popper, the world-famous gourmand!\"\n\n\"Huh. This is my first time hearing of you.\"\n\n\"\u2026 Anyway, I understand your restaurant has a\u2013\"\n\n\"That's right, very best ingredients, or a full refund plus \u00a350 000.\"\n\n\"Well, I've come to test that! Not only can I determine the quality of your food, but also *exactly* whence it came!\"\n\n\"Brilliant! Let's get you a table, shall we?\"\n\nIn due course, Josiah led Popper to his seat and gave him a menu. King asked, \"Alright, what'll ya have?\"\n\n\"Let's see,\" Phil mused, \"I'll have the rabbit stew\u2026 and the London broil with mashed potatoes.\"\n\n\"And to drink?\"\n\n\"Just water.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir. Your food will be out shortly.\" And with that, Joe gave the order to his head chef.\n\n\"Mon Dieu!\" the chef cried.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Zere is no more rabbit! We just used ze last of it!\"\n\n\"Oh, bollocks!\" Josiah groaned, his face buried in his hands. \"Please, Pierre! You have to do something!\"\n\n\"Oui, monsieur! I will do all I can to remedy zis situation!\"\n\n\"Thank you, Pierre,\" King sighed.\n\nImmediately, Joe brought a glass of water to Phil. After taking a sip, Popper proclaimed, \"Excellent! It's from Leaf Spring, just outside of Newcastle.\"\n\nAghast, King confirmed, \"Why, yes! That's right.\"\n\nJust then, Pierre quickly brought out the London broil and mashed potatoes and ran back into the kitchen. \"What about the rabbit stew?\" Phil inquired.\n\n\"Terribly sorry, sir,\" Joe said, \"The stew is, eh, taking a bit longer than we anticipated. We'll have it to you soon enough!\"\n\nPopper was suspicious, but he shrugged it off and began eating. After sampling both the meat and potatoes, his eyes lit up, and he chortled, \"This is spectacular! The beef is from a Jersey cow, raised on a farm in Manchester. The potatoes are a blend, half grown here in Derbychesterfolkshireville, and the other half from Otumwa, Iowa.\"\n\n\"Tha-that's amazing!\" Joe gasped, \"How did you know?\"\n\nPhil touched his nose and winked. \"Don't you worry about that. I have my ways.\"\n\nAt this point, Josiah was more anxious than a dog on his second visit to the vet. He slunk into the kitchen, when a beaming Pierre whispered to him, \"Not to worry, monsieur. I have got everysing taken care of.\" Placing the stew on the table, Pierre announced, \"Here you go, monsieur Poppehr. I apologize for ze wait. Enjoy!\"\n\nAt last, King could rest easy. Amidst the cool, ethereal bliss of relief under which Josiah lay, a familiar voice beckoned him\u2026\n\n^^\"Joe.\"\n\n\"Hello?\" he answered, eyes closed and mouth smiling.\n\n^\"Joe?\"\n\n\"I am here.\"\n\n\"*Joe!*\"\n\nHe sprung awake and found Popper directly in front of him. \"That'll be \u00a350 000, Mr. King.\"\n\n\"B-but, I don't understand! What could possibly be wrong?\"\n\n\"You said this was rabbit stew, did you not?\"\n\n\"Y-yes, of course it is!\"\n\n\"Then,\" Popper said, showing him the bowl, \"would you care to explain why *there is a hare in my soup?*\"",

The friends, not willing to concede, look for a different way in and find an entrance never before used.  \n\nIt is through this entrance that they find a secret passage way, one that is made at first to look like a dead end but is truly a turn in the hallway. They venture around this turn and into a great room.  \n\nIn this room are torches. A sign just inside the room warns, \"He who lights this shall burn to death.\" (In Egyptian hieroglyphs of course) The first friend takes a torch and lights the end. The Friends venture through the room to another.  \n\nIn this second room is a small lake, with a small canoe able to seat three. In the canoe is a paddle that reads, \"He who uses this shall die a watery death.\" The second friend takes this paddle and uses it to guide the three of them to the other side of the lake and through a third and final door.  \n\nIn this last room is a great atrium, filled with heaps upon heaps of golden artifacts and jewels. The three friends rush in and come to a golden sarcophagus. The third friend looks at it and sees that it has the warning \"The first man to touch this treasure shall die a most terrible death\" written on its exterior. The third friend, giving the message no care, proceeds to pick up as much gold as he can. His friends quickly follow suit.  \n\nMany months later, after the friends had returned home with their loot and used it to live lucrative lives, the third friend received troubling news. The first friend had been sleeping when his mansion had caught fire and burned to the ground, killing him. Remembering the warning, he calls the second friend, but they both laugh it off.  \n\nA month later, the third friend is watching the news when a breaking story comes on. It is his second friend, who had been out on his yacht. The boat had unexplainably capsized, killing him. The third friend saw this and grew terribly fearful.  \n\nAssuming he had a month left before whatever horror would befall him, the third friend sold many of his belongings to afford the most secure underground bunker. He then used his remaining fortune to buy an incredibly high-tech security system, cameras all over, and 30+ armed guards stationed at the entrance.  \n\nThe third friend spent a month in the bunker.  \n\n30 days passed, and the night was falling when the third friend look to the security cameras. Outside of the bunker, at the entrance, was an empty expanse of land, save one object. All the security guards were mysteriously gone, and just in the frame was the silhouette of a sarcophagus. The third friend panicked.  \n\nRushing to the door, he pushed all manners of furniture before it. A fridge, a bookshelf, his bed, a desk. But once he had placed the final barricade, a great pounding game to the door. Looking to security footage, the sarcophagus had begun to float and was using itself as a battering ram. To the third friend's horror, the door began to crack.  \n\nWith a tremendous boom, the door and all the furniture was blasted away. The third friend screamed, as there in the doorway floated the sarcophagus. He ran through the bunker, stalked by the sarcophagus. The friend jumped into the bathroom and locked the door behind him. There, he sat on the toilet and cried.  \n\n**BOOM** The sarcophagus was there, breaking through the bathroom door. The third friend panicked, running to the sink as the sarcophagus inched forward. The friend picked up a bottle of shampoo and through it. The sarcophagus kept coming. He threw a can of shaving cream. The sarcophagus was within 10 feet of him now. He threw a tube of toothpaste. The sarcophagus was within arms length. The friend made one final attempt, he reached into the cabinet, grabbed a plastic bottle, filled with a green liquid, and threw it. The sarcophagus fell to the ground and turned to dust.  \n\nThe man marveled at this. Looking for the last thing he had thrown, he picked it up and thought, \"All I had to do was take some NyQuil and the coffin would stop.\"",

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\"  \nThe man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks again accept him, feed him, and again fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\"  \nThe man says, \"All right, all right. I'm dying to know.  \n\"If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?\"  \nThe monks reply, \"You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles, when you find these numbers, you will become a monk.\" The man sets about his task. Some 54 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.  \nHe says,\" I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth\".  \nThe monks reply, \"Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound\".  \nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door where the head monk says, \"The sound is right behind that door\". The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked.  \nHe says, \"Real funny. May I have the key?\" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.  \nThe man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.  \nBehind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire, And so it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.  \nFinally, the monks say, \"This is the last key to the last door\".\nThe man is relieved to know that he has finally reached to the end.\nHe unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.  \nBut he can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",

Now for some reason it didn't stink and I hollered at him , \"Come back my farts don't stink!\" Of course he didn't believe me and when he came back in 5 minutes there was no smell and , he said as much. The trap was set! I told him that my farts don't stink and I would bet him $100! And I would let him be the Judge. He thought for about 10 seconds and said , \"OK it's a .bet\" , and we shook. I told him, \"I can't fart right now\", but when I felt one coming on I would call him over so he could sniff my butt when I was cutting one. We knocked off after that and went home for the day. The next day I got to work before he did and bet everyone in the shop $20 each that when I called M*** over he would sniff my ass as I farted.[$20 x 15= $300]. Well soon after M*** walked in and everyone went to work. About 15 minutes later I hollered over to M***, \"Get over here I'm about to cut one!\". He came over with the biggest grin on his face and, put his face close to my butt. I ripped a green monster and he said, \"All right! that's the worst smelling fart ever!\". The shop went quiet as everyone just looked at us and stared bug eyed. Then laughing, yelling, finger pointing- the whole shop fell apart. M*** looked at me with pure hate, I thought he was going to hit me. M*** went into the parking lot , I chased him down and gave him the $100. He said he was going home and to, kiss his ass. I went back into the shop, collected my $300 for a $200 profit and, went back to work. At break time I was fired-it was worth it.\n\n",

Although, when I was young there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was. It sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra. Then, and only then, can I tell you EXACTLY how old you are.\u2019\n\nThey wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the best of her. She looks up and down the street and sees that no one else is in sight and finally blurts out, \u2018What the hell, go ahead.\u2019 He slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully.

He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes of this, she says, \u2018Okay, okay, enough already\u2026.How old am I?\u2019\n\nHe completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, \u2018Madam, you are exactly 50 years old.\u2019\n\nStunned and amazed, the woman says, \u2018That was incredible, how could you tell?\u2019\n\nThe old man says, \u2018I was behind you at McDonalds.\u2019",

When he wakes up and throws the covers back, he realized his wife is sleeping naked next to him. He decides, since he has some extra time, to wake her up with a pleasant surprise. He proceeds to go down on her, she enjoys it, everybody wins. \n\nMoments later when the deed is done he goes to the bathroom to brush his teeth and sees his one of his wife's pubic hair stuck between his two front teeth. He panics realizing that he must go to the dentist in an hour and doesn't want to look like a fool. He struggles to get the pubic hair out with floss so he gets a brilliant idea to grab the fingernail clippers and cut it down as much as possible. He is sure that the pubic hair is no longer distinguishable, and simply looks like a spec, he thinks to himself \"the dentist will have no idea.\" \n\nSo shortly thereafter, he arrives at the dentist office where they have him seated in the chair for cleaning. The dentist walks in and begins the cleaning, and after a moment he begins to laugh. The man asks the dentist \"What? what is so funny?\" \n\nThe dentist asks the man \"You went down on your wife this morning, didn't you?\" \n\nThe man panics and so sure he eliminated the evidence from his teeth he asks \"Why would you say this? that isn't a pubic hair in my teeth!\"\n\n The dentist chuckles and says, \"No, you have some shit on your chin!\"",

If a tree wants to tell another tree \"hello\", all he/she has to do is think of the word \"hello\" and think of the tree in which the \"hello\" needs to be sent to.  That thought will travel down a trunk and through some ground and into a tangled system of roots that mirror the shape of silly string.  The soft and kind message is able to find out where it needs to go, because that is what it was told to do.  Once that message arrives through the beautiful root system and into the mind of the recipient tree, it turns the tree recipient into a tree messenger.  He/she then acknowledges the message, and is able to respond via root system tree message telepathy.  The original tree messenger now becomes the tree recipient and a tree messenger.  Not only is she/he able to send messages through her/his beautiful clever wooden, open gate of love words, the tree is also able to receive such messages, which completes, and molds /her/him into a communicating tree of the forest.  \n\nIf a human can talk to a tree, then the tree can also talk to a human, as long as the tree can acknowledge that a human is indeed trying to talk to the tree.

If that eagle flees the nest, it is because the tree no longer wants it to reside in its space, because there is nothing that is residing with the tree and within its space, and the tree will want to be alone like it was in the forest with all of the other trees.

So I thought I might reach out to the jokes community of reddit and ask for  any terrible, cringe, hilarious and/or dirty xmas cracker jokes you have, made up, whatever.\n\nThere is every chance I will have seen a lot of these as I have filtered through 100s in my time looking for amusing ones, but I will appreciate any help I can get.\n\n\nSome examples of the type of jokes I am looking for are:\n\nWhat kind of motorbike does Santa ride?\nA holly davidson\n\nWhy does Santa have 3 gardens?\nSo he can hoe hoe hoe.\n\nWhat does Miley Cyrus have at xmas?\nTwerky.\n\nWhat happened to the man who stole an advent calendar?\nHe got 25 days.\n\nIf they were funny that'd be good, ones like the following which are just plain bad are less desirable\n\nWhat's the most popular xmas wine?\n\"I don't like brussel sprouts\"\n\nAny way all help appreciated",

I may be your height, but I'm an old man!  I can't fight back!\"\n\n\"Silly Rabbi, kicks are for Trids!\"\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nBONUS JOKE:\n\nOn the way back to the ship to continue the tour, the Rabbi approaches the Trids - \"I tried to make him stop, it didn't work.\"  He said.\n\n\"Oh, that's alright!  Have fun with your tour!\"  One of them replied.\n\nAll of a sudden, a bird flying across the sky flew across the rabbi's head, leaving his droppings on the Rabbi's head.\n\n\"Do you happen to have any way of washing this off?\"\n\n\"No!  Don't wash it off!  That's the droppings of the sacred Foo bird!  The Foo's droppings landing on your head indicates good luck and prosperity!\"\n\n\"The Foo bird, huh?  I see.\"\n\nWanting to respect their culture, the rabbi waits for the boat to depart before trying to wash the droppings off.\n\nOnce on course, he washed his head, trying to get the smell of the Foo out.\n\nAs soon as he was successful, the boat, almost like magic, suddenly sank.\n\nHe, along with other passengers, sank to their death.\n\nLesson: If the foo s**t's, wear it.",

If I start to get nervous, I take a sip.\"\n\nThe next Sunday, the new priest took the Monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon when he got nervous, he took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door:\n\n* Sip the vodka; don't gulp.\n* There are 10 commandments, not 12.\n* There are 12 disciples, not 10.\n* Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.\n* Jacob wagered his donkey; he did not \"bet his ass.\"\n* We do not refer to Jesus Christ as \"The Late J.C.\"\n* The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy, Junior, and the Spook.\n* David slew Goliath; he did not \"kick the shit outta\" him.\n* When David was hit by a stone and knocked off his donkey, don't say he was stoned off his ass.\n* We don't refer to the cross as the \"Big T.\"\n* When Jesus broke the bread at the last supper, he said, \"Take this and eat it for it is my body.\" He did not say \"Eat me.\"\n* The Virgin Mary is not called \"Mary with the cherry.\"\n* The recommended grace before a meal is not \"Rub-a-dub-dub, thanks for the grub, yay God!\"\n* There will be a taffy pulling contest at St. Peter's, not a Peter pulling contest at St. Taffy's.",

The parrot's owner, still in shock, took the bill. \"$150!\" she cried. \"$150 just to tell me my bird is dead?!\" \n  \nThe vet shrugged. \"If you'd taken my word for it, the bill would only have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, what did you expect?\" \n ",

I can tell you everything about this glorious country!\".

You are skilled!\", says the politician. The spy smirks. \"But I still think you American spy.\"\nThe spy is getting frustrated, but still unfazed. He replies, \"I am good drinker, a true Russian! Let us drink, and see who can come out top!\"\n\nThe bar turns its attention to the politician and the spy, who are now in a drinking contest. The bartender serves drink after drink of vodka. After about an hour of drinking, the politician nearly passes out, unable to hold as much liquor as the spy, to a resounding cheer amongst the bar.\n\nIn the midst of the cheering, the Russian politician gets up, smiling, and in a slurred speech, repeats \"You are good, you are good... but I still think you are spy.\"\n\nThe American spy, piss drunk, loses his skill and gives up. \"Okay, you got me. I am an American. But what made you think that way, after all this time?\"\n\nThe Russian politician replies, \"there aren't many black people in Russia.\"",

        "body": "So, like 10 years ago or so when AIM was still popular I met this girl in one of the single chat rooms. I used to get on the chat rooms and speak to random strangers for hours, especially in the summer. This was probably the summer before freshman year, and I meet this girl with the screen name of sexyblonde69. We are just chatting and going back in forth. I think I met her in a singles chat. We exchanged ASL, she said she was 35, female, from Texas. I thought it was awesome she was from Texas and I told her I was 25. I don't know if she believed me, but I have always looked older than I am. We exchange photos and I find out she is from Houston. She is stacked. I mean, gorgeous breasts. One day, a buddy of mine stops by my house and tells me he is running from the cops and needed to stash some of his coke at my house for a day or two. I oblige, and ask him if I can do some. He says of course, just get him back. So, I do a line and stick the rest in my closet. Both of my parents were working at the time and my brothers were either not home or just not around. I go out to the computer room and jump on AIM. Sexyblonde69, whose name is Cheri, is on and we start chatting. She tells me that she is about to go do some shopping for a party tonight and ask what I am up to. I felt like a badass so I bragged about just doing some coke and how I was just chilling at the house. She asked if I had any plans for tonight and I told her no. She invites me out to Houston so I can go to the club with her friends. Keep in mind, I was 14 without a car. My dad always had an extra work truck or two at the house for some reason, so I could definitely get a car. I had been working as a shop hand most of the summer so I also had a little spending money. I start really thinking that I could make it to Houston. Then she adds in that if I show up, I will definitely get to fuck her tonight. Okay. Now I am stoked. I pull the coke down from the closet and do another line. I really have to think on this. If I go to Houston, I get to lose my virginity to a gorgeous 35 year old woman. Well, I think with my dick like any other 14 year old would and I go check to make sure the keys are in the work truck. Cheri and I exchange numbers and I hit the road. Keep in mind this is before GPS on your phones and everything. I believe I had a Razr... So, a typical drive to Houston would take 2 and a half hours. I leave at 5pm and plan on meeting Cheri at her house and then taking her out for dinner before the club. So, I get to Houston as planned around 8, but then I proceed to drive around Houston on the phone with Cheri for two fucking hours because she could not give me directions as to where she lived. I finally pull up to her house. Nice looking house, it was all lit up and there were two vehicles out front already. I think, okay. You got this. I pop a mint and head for the door. I knock and about 30 seconds later some dude in shorts and a wife beater answers the door. Big beer belly sticking out. Had to be in his mid 50's.. I nervously ask if Cheri is home, to which he replies yes that she is getting ready. I am 2 hours late and this bitch is still getting ready! He invites me in and introduces himself as Mike, Cheri's father. We walk into the living room where he is watching the History Channel. He offers me a beer, to which I decline because I tell him I am driving and want to be responsible. He tells me good choice and we start watching TV. Well, after 10 minutes or so he pulls out a joint and asks if I would like to smoke. I tell him fuck yes. I was a bit nervous that Cheri did not exist and I really needed to smoke to calm some nerves.He lights it up and we continue watching TV and smoking for another 30 minutes or so. It is creeping up on 11 and I start to get antsy, so I ask him if he thinks Cheri is ready yet. He said he will check, and he screams \"Cheri, are you ready yet!?\" to which she replies that she almost ready and to hold the fuck on. A sigh of relief. There is a woman here! about 5 more minutes goes by and here comes Cheri, wheeling herself in in a wheelchair. I am high and not expecting this. My jaw drops. She asks if everything is okay and I reply it's fine, I just didn't know she was in a wheelchair. She asks if that is a problem, which it wasn't. She and I start to leave the house when her dad calls to me and tells me I will probably need these, and he tosses me the keys. I ask what this is to and he explains it's the wheelchair accessible van out front. Okay, well it is way too late for dinner now and Cheri is apologizing for taking so long she just wanted to look perfect for me. I am still in shock at the wheelchair. I had never seen a full picture of her, but I did see her from the waist up. Those tits. It didn't matter. I drove to Houston for a good time, nothing was going to stop me. She directs me to the club and I tell her that I can't find my license and that I am sorry but we may not be able to get in. She tells me it is fine that she knows the guy working the door and she will get me in. Sure enough, I can just walk on by no questions asked. Her friend is turning 35, so she rented out the VIP room in the back and had bottles all over the table. It gets crazy pretty quick. I am out there, dancing and having a good time when I see Cheri sitting there with a bottle and a sad look on her face. I walk up and ask her what the problem is and she tells me that I haven't even asked her to dance. My jaw hits the floor again. I am drunk, high, and wondering how the fuck I am suppose to dance with a girl in a wheelchair. Regardless, I apologize. I mean, she is fucking me tonight, I need to try my hardest not to screw that up. So, I ask her if she wants to dance. An R&B song is on, it is a slow jam and I push her out to the dance floor and twirl her around some. Now she is smiling, and the song changes. She tells me this is her song and to back up. It's a faster song, so I back up off her and the next thing I know she is popping a wheelie and spinning circles on the dance floor. So, I remember I still have that coke in my pocket and I ask everyone if they want a line. A lay out 5 or 6 lines and Cheri and I both get one along with some of her friends. After a few minutes she tells me to lean in, so I bend down to hear what she has to say and she tells me that coke has her feeling a certain type of way and that we should get out of there. I tell her hell yeah and we tell her friends by. I get her loaded up into the van and off we go. I tell her she has to tell me how to get back to her house because I sucked at remembering directions. So, after 15 minutes of driving or so we get to a dirt road. I tell her I don't remember this road, but she tells me just a little further and there is a nice park we can park at. I tell her okay, and we pull up to the park. We are making out and things are starting to get heated when she asks me if I want to fuck her. Well, the \"how\" had not crossed my mind until now. She points to a tree and tells me that is how. I do not understand, so she goes under her chair and pulls out a contraption. It is a sex swing. She tells me she has done this before and I just needed to climb the tree to tie off the ends. I am horny, young, and drunk. I tell her hold on though, and I do a key bump. I am up that tree in thirty seconds, tying that rope like a fucking boy scout. I put her in the sing and start getting after it. I mean, I am losing my virginity! The best thirty seconds ever. We get loaded back up and headed back to her house, it is 3am or so and all the lights are still on. We go in through the front door and she leaves skid marks as she races off to the restroom. I think \"God, don't make it so obvious..\" And I walk into the living room, where her dad is still sitting watching the History Channel. He asks me how the night was, and I tell him it was great. He has a really wonderful daughter. He thanks me for taking her out and giving her a chance. Tells me it has always been pretty difficult for her to date. He then asks me if she had told me about the last asshole that she dated, and I told him no that she hadn't. I asked what happened, and Mike says the guy was a real asshole. That he left her hanging.",

For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.\n\n2. Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to buy a new car.\n\n3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You would have to pull over to the side of the road, close all of the windows, shut off the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue. For some reason you would simply accept this.\n\n4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall the engine.\n\n5. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable, five times as fast and twice as easy to drive - but would run on only five percent of the roads.\n\n6. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would all be replaced by a single \"General Protection Fault\" warning light.\n\n7. The airbag system would ask \"Are you sure?\" before deploying.\n\n8. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.\n\n9. Every time GM introduced a new car, car buyers would have to learn to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car.\n\n10.

God then said, \"I have sent you heart healthy vegetables and olive oil in which to cook them.\" And Satan brought forth deep fried fish and chicken-fried steak so big it needed its own platter. And Man gained more weight and his cholesterol went through the roof. God then created a light, fluffy white cake, named it \"Angel Food Cake,\" and said, \"It is good.\"\n\nSatan then created chocolate cake and named it \"Devil's Food.\" God then brought forth running shoes so that His children might lose those extra pounds. And Satan gave cable TV with a remote control so Man would not have to toil changing the channels. And Man and Woman laughed and cried before the flickering blue light and gained pounds. \n\nThen God brought forth the potato, naturally low in fat and brimming with nutrition. And Satan peeled off the healthful skin and sliced the starchy center into chips and deep-fried them. And Man gained pounds. God then gave lean beef so that Man might consume fewer calories and still satisfy his appetite. And Satan created McDonald's and its 99-cent double cheeseburger. Then said, \"You want fries with that?\" And Man replied, \"Yes! And super size them!\" And Satan said, \"It is good.\" \n\nAnd Man went into cardiac arrest.

Since he has been a regular customer for years we go out of our way to add some special touches to the cabin for the occasion.\n\nFriday night rolls around and he checks in like always.

She's got a bout of the chlamydia.\". \n\nKinda shocked by his openess, I say \"Well, there is always the back door until it clears up I guess\".\n\nRon says, \"Nope.  She's got the gonorrhea back there\".\n\nNow feeling really awkward I say \"Well, I guess there is always a BJ\".  \n\nHe reponds \"Nope.  She has the herpes on her mouth.  Don't want no sores.\"\n\nWithout thinking I blurt out \"Dude, why on Earth did you marry this girl?\n\nRon grins and says,\" Well, she has worms too and you know how I love to fish\"",

        "body": "A farmer had a decent racing horse that one day had twins. He called the twins Edward and Tobias. The colts were incredibly healthy and competitive, from a young age they would run together. Whenever the farmer would lay out some new hay or corn feed, the two colts would race, pushing each other as hard as they could to see who would win. Tobias always won, but it was always a close race. The farmer, noticing how competitive they were, decided to enter them in a racing competition. \n\nTheir first race both horses were very excited. Ed said to Tobias \u201cGood luck, may the best horse win.\u201d Tobias responded \u201cSame to you, let\u2019s beat these other guys!\u201d \n\nWell the race started and Tobias and Edward took off, taking an early lead. It went back and forth, Tobias passing Edward, Edward passing Tobias. The first lap finished with Tobias having a slight lead. The second lap finished with him still having a small lead. On the third and final lap, close to finish, though Edward was leading, Tobias managed to pull ahead and take the win. The other horses were completely destroyed in comparison. \n\n\u201cGood race!\u201d Edward told Tobias, and Tobias agreed. \n\nThe farmer realized that he had made bank, that somehow he found two golden tickets. He entered the horses into many other local competitions and every time his horses would destroy the other horses. It always ended with Tobias barely beating Edward. \n\nEventually the two horses found themselves in a larger arena. They were at the state fair. Edward turned to Tobias and said \u201cI\u2019ll get you this time!\u201d Tobias responded \u201cMeh, I don\u2019t actually care if you or I win, so long as we beat these other idiots!\u201d Another horse snorts Edward said, \u201cGood luck!\u201d Tobias responded \u201cYou have good luck too!\u201d \n\nThe race started and Tobias and Edward took out of the gates. It was a tough race; the other horses were able to keep up with Edward and Tobias for the first lap. But the two horses kept pushing each other. It went back and forth, Tobias passing Edward, Edward passing Tobias. The first lap finished with Tobias having a slight lead. The second lap finished with him still having a small lead. By now they had a lead over the other horses. On the third and final lap, close to finish, though Edward was leading, Tobias managed to pull ahead and take the win. \n\nPanting, Edward congratulated Tobias. \n\nA few years went by and now Edward and Tobias were professional race horses. Their competition put them in the spot light of many the newspaper. Ever was Tobias the main headline though. Even as they got older, Tobias would always beat Edward. \n\nOne day they found themselves in the Kentucky Derby. In the starting gates, Edward turned to Tobias and said \u201cI will get you this time, I know it! This is the race, here, in front of all these people.\u201d Tobias responded \u201cWe\u2019ll see brother, first we have to beat these other horses. None of them are poor runners either.\u201d \u201cAgreed,\u201d Edward responded, \u201cBut it would be nice to beat you just once.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve always been the one who pushed me so hard.\u201d Tobias responded. Edward said back, \u201cAnd you\u2019re the reason I\u2019ve always worked so hard too.\u201d Another horse vomited in its starting gate. \n\nThe gun went off, the gates opened up. Tobias and Edward took off. They were trailing the leaders, but didn\u2019t seem to mind, they were in their own world. The two horses kept pushing each other. It went back and forth, Tobias passing Edward, Edward passing Tobias. The first lap finished with Tobias having a slight lead. The second lap finished with him still having a small lead. By now they had caught up with the other horses. On the third and final lap, close to finish, though Edward was leading, Tobias managed to pull ahead and take the win. It finished with Tobias in first and Edward a very, very close second with another horse right behind him. It was such a close race it came down to verifying with a photograph. Edward turned to Tobias, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you beat me, I tried so hard. Still, we just won the Kentucky Derby!!\u201d \n\nYears later, after living luxurious lives where they were pampered by the farmer who found them and long after they were retired, Tobias turned to Edward and said. \u201cDo you want to have one final race, for old time\u2019s sake?\u201d Edward responded, \u201cI never could beat you, I always wanted to have a chance to do so, just to know what it feels like to win.\u201d Tobias said \u201cTell you what, why don\u2019t we have a race? Just like back when we were colts; let\u2019s run to that feed mill over there and back to this fence three times.\u201d Edward said \u201cI don\u2019t think I could take loosing again, after all this time, coming in second. I don\u2019t know if I would want to live after another loss. I don\u2019t have that much life in me any more.\u201d Tobias said, \u201cTell you what, if it comes down to it, if it is really close, I\u2019ll let you win. Just so you can know what it feels like. Yeah, it won\u2019t be \u2018real\u2019 but you\u2019ll get to know.\u201d Edward agreed. \n\n\u201cReady, set, GO!\u201d And both horses were off. The two horses kept pushing each other. It went back and forth, Tobias passing Edward, Edward passing Tobias. It was almost as though the two old horses had the vitality of their youth again. The first lap finished with Tobias having a slight lead. The second lap finished with him still having a small lead again. On the third and final lap, close to finish, Edward was leading. It looked like he had the race in the bag. But suddenly Tobias seemed to get another final wind and he pushed ahead. He beat Edward. Tobias started prancing, victoriously, Edward, his soul crushed, lay down on the ground. \n\nThe old farmer\u2019s dog, who had known both horses since their infancy, came up to Tobias and said, \u201cTobias, why would you do that? Why would you crush your brother\u2019s hopes and dreams like that? There was nothing riding on this race, no point. Why? Why? Why would you do that?\u201d \n\nUpon hearing the dog, Edward stood up, he looked at his brother and said \u201cHoly Shit, Toby, a talking dog!\u201d",

The lawyer did his best selling job, and finally the rancher agreed to take half of what he was asking.\n\nAfter the rancher had signed the release and took the check, the young lawyer couldn't resist gloating a little over his success, telling the rancher, \"You know, I hate to tell you this, old man, but I put one over on you in there. I couldn't have won the case. The engineer was asleep and the fireman was in the caboose when the train went through your ranch that morning. I didn't have one witness to put on the stand.

People with experience in designing production lines will tell you how difficult it is to have everything happen with timings so precise that every single unit coming off of it is perfect 100% of the time. Small variations in the environment (which cannot be controlled in a cost-effective fashion) mean quality assurance checks must be smartly distributed across the production line so that customers all the way down to the supermarket won\u2019t get frustrated and purchase another product instead.\n\nUnderstanding how important that was, the CEO of the toothpaste factory gathered the top people in the company together. Since their own engineering department was already stretched too thin, they decided to hire an external engineering company to solve their empty boxes problem.\n\nThe project followed the usual process: budget and project sponsor allocated, RFP (request for proposal), third-parties selected, and six months (and $8 million) later a fantastic solution was delivered \u2014 on time, on budget, high quality and everyone in the project had a great time. The problem was solved by using high-tech precision scales that would sound a bell and flash lights whenever a toothpaste box would weigh less than it should. The line would stop, and someone had to walk over and yank the defective box off the line, then press another button to re-start the line.\n\nA short time later, the CEO decided to have a look at the ROI (return on investment) of the project: amazing results! No empty boxes ever shipped out of the factory after the scales were put in place. There were very few customer complaints, and they were gaining market share. \u201cThat was some money well spent!\u201d he said, before looking closely at the other statistics in the report.\n\nThe number of defects picked up by the scales was 0 after three weeks of production use. How could that be? It should have been picking up at least a dozen a day, so maybe there was something wrong with the report. He filed a bug against it, and after some investigation, the engineers indicated the statistics were indeed correct. The scales were NOT picking up any defects, because all boxes that got to that point in the conveyor belt were good.\n\nPerplexed, the CEO traveled down to the factory and walked up to the part of the line where the precision scales were installed. A few feet before the scale, a $20 desk fan was blowing any empty boxes off the belt and into a bin. Puzzled, the CEO turned to one of the workers who stated, \u201cOh, that\u2026One of the guys put it there \u2019cause he was tired of walking over every time the bell rang!\"",

        "body": "OK - so many years ago, i was actually a practicing jew, in a yeshiva no less. The rabbi's would sometimes tell us jokes. most were awful. this one i thought was amusing. in a reddit filled with old reposts, i think it'll at least be a bit fresh.\n\nA long time ago there was a small jewish community is a very anti-semitic christian european town. The anti-semitism reached such a fever pitch that the christian community members wanted to run the jews out of town, but the local bishop, who was effectively the mayor, had the last say.\n\n\"We cannot simply run them out of town\", he said, \"without at least giving them a chance to defend themselves. Let them know that one week from this Sunday, in the town square, I will personally challenge a champion of their choosing to a battle of spiritual purity. It will be a silent battle of the wits. If they lose, they must leave the town. But if I am bested, they may stay.\"\n\nSo word reached back into the synagogue, and they were all veklempt. \"Who are we gonna send??\" They had no idea what they were in for, but finally, good old Shmueli volunteered. The congregation was anxious, but hopeful that somehow shmueli could save them.\n\nThe next sunday, with much pomp and circumstance the bishop and shmueli faced off in the town square. After staring at each other for a few moments, the Cardinal rapidly lifted up one finger into the air and held it - the challenge had begun.\n\nShmueli, with a stern look on his face, quickly raised two fingers in the air.\n\nThe bishop lowered his hand, and nodded.. impressed at the prowess of his competitor.\n\nThen the bishop lifted up his hand above his head - palm open and fingers spread apart.\n\nThe crowd gasped as Shmuelli responded by making a firm first held close to his heart.\n\nAgain, the bishop nodded- somewhat surprised at the response. This 'shmueli' was a worthy adversary.\n\nFinally the bishop motioned to an assistant and whispered in his ear. Moments later, the assistant handed the bishop a bottle of red wine. The bishop showed this off to the crowd who murmured in confusion.\n\nAt this, shmueli motioned to his friend yitzchak, and with a few quiet words, moments later yitzchak handed shmueli a wheel of white cheese, which he held aloft.\n\nAt this, the bishop bowed his head, and said quietly, \"the battle is over. Shmeuli has bested me. The jews may stay.\"\n\nThe jews cheered and danced all the way back to the synagogue, carrying shmueli on their shoulders. \n\nWhen they had all gone, all that was left were the christian community members, standing around the bishop in stunned silence. Finally, one asked: \"Bishop, what happened? we didn't understand the battle. How did he beat you?\"\n\nThe bishop responded, \"ah.. shmueli is a wise man. At first i lifted up one finger to say that there is only one god, and that is the lord - to which shmueli responded with two fingers.. saying yes, but the lord can be worshipped in more than one way.\"\n\n\"then i lifted up my hand, fingers spread out, to say - the jewish people are scattered and formless across the earth! Without a homeland or center - vagrants and vagabonds!\"\n\nTo this, shmueli held a fist over his heart - saying that above all else, the jewish people are united with one heart - and that overcomes and separation in the world.\"\n\nFinally, was my last and most brutal accusation - with the bottle of wine i said that the jews' sins are as red as the wine i hold - a simple fact to which i can accept no denial.\n\nAnd to this, shmueli responded with a wheel of white cheese. Saying yes, but through devotion and love of god, our sins may be transmuted into purity and light.\"\n\nThe crowd was awed. This champion of the jews had earned his victory. They all slowly shuffled off to their homes.\n\nMeanwhile... back int he synagogue..\n\n\"Hey shmueli!!\" said avram.. \"what the heck was dat all about!?\"\n\n\"Well\", said shmueli..\"it was really pretty straight forward. First he lifts up a finger like he's a'gonna poke my eye out.. so i says, 'you poke MY eye out, im gonna poke BOTH you eyes out!'\n\nThen he lifts his hand like he's gonna give me a smack.. so i says with my fist 'watch out or i'll clock you one too!'\n\nFinally, i guess he felt bad and wanted to make nice and have a party. So i said sure!! you bring the wine, i'll bring the cheese!\n\n",

This happens yet again. The next evening the man again orders and drinks three beers at a time, several times. Soon the entire town is whispering about the Man Who Orders Three Beers.\nFinally, a week later, the bartender broaches the subject on behalf of the town. \"I don't mean to pry, but folks around here are wondering why you always order three beers.\"\n\"'Tis odd, isn't it?\" the man replies. \"You see, I have two brothers, and one went to America, and the other to Australia. We promised each other that we would always order an extra two beers whenever we drank as a way of keeping up the family bond.\"\nThe bartender and the whole town was pleased with this answer, and soon the Man Who Orders Three Beers became a local celebrity and source of pride to the hamlet, even to the extent that out-of-towners would come to watch him drink.\nThen, one day, the man comes in and orders only two beers. The bartender pours them with a heavy heart. This continues for the rest of the evening -- he orders only two beers. Word flies around town. Prayers are offered for the soul of one of the brothers.\nThe next day, the bartender says to the man, \"Folks around here, me first of all, want to offer condolences to you for the death of your brother. You know -- the two beers and all...\"\nThe man ponders this for a moment, then replies, \"You'll be happy to hear that my two brothers are alive and well. It's just that I, myself, have decided to give up drinking for Lent.\"\n\n",

        "body": "First of all, - just for some background: My Mum died right when I was born, (she was actually really, really hot- but this isn't about her. I guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.\n\nAnyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.\n\nI don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn't make it for me- but I thought she was so fucking beautiful that I watched it twice. I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. (My dad's family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it).\n\nSooo... I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home.\n\nMy friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to fuck her brains out. Looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly.\n\nAfter we left, we all went to crash with my Sister's friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging.\nPretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I'm not saying that I'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.\n\nMy friend and my sister never hooked up I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was fucked up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.\n\nSadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart... and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her.\n\nBut I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh.\n\nA little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can't say I was surprised.\nBut even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone.\n\nIt was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him.",

In the meantime the village  gathered to discuss the big problem they had with Tom.So the doctor revealed Tom tha there was only one solution for his problem and he should take a car battery and connect the opposing poles to his penis. So Tom went out of the doctors office took the JumpStart cable and connected it to the tip and balls.As in the Frankenstein's movie the people went to kill him with everything they could find. As the man got closer to Tom they heard a horrible screaming followed by the words \"RUN FOR YOUR LIVES HE IS RECHARGING IT\". Sorry for the bad English not my native language.",

The genie clapped his hands and  a motorcycle appears.\n\nThe bear is now totally blown away that the rabbit has wasted two of his wishes on such stupid things. \"I freaking hate that rabbit!\" he thinks to himself.\n\nThe genie then asks \"Okay bear, what is your final wish?\" The bear thinks long and hard, and then making up his mind he says: \"Okay okay, I wish all of the other bears in the WORLD were super hot female bears!\" The genie claps his hands and assures the bear it is done.\n\nThe rabbit, who is now wearing his new helmet and revving the engine of his new motorcycle, then gets asked for his final wish.

He enquired of God, 'Where have you been?' \n \nGod pointed downwards through the clouds. Archangel Michael looked puzzled and said, 'What is it?' \n \n'It's a planet,' replied God, 'and I've put LIFE on it. I'm going to call it Earth and it's going to be a great place of balance.' \n \n'Balance?' inquired Michael, still confused. \n \nGod explained, pointing down to different parts of the Earth. 'For example, North America will be a place of great opportunity and wealth, while South America is going to be poor; the Middle East over there will be a hot spot, and Russia will be a cold spot. Over there I've placed a continent of white people and over there is a continent of black people.' \n \nGod continued, pointing to the different countries. \n \nThis one will be extremely hot and arid while this one will be very cold and covered in ice.' \n \nThe Archangel, impressed by God's work, then pointed to another area of land and asked, 'What's that?' \n \n'Ah,' said God. That's the North of England, the most glorious place on earth. There are beautiful people, seven Premiership football teams in the North West alone, and many impressive cities; it is the home of the world's finest artists, musicians, writers, thinkers, explorers and politicians. The people from the North of England are going to be modest, intelligent and humorous and they're going to be found travelling the world. They'll be extremely sociable, hard-working and high-achieving, and they will be known throughout the world as speakers of truth.' \n \nMichael gasped in wonder and admiration but then proclaimed, 'What about balance God, you said there will be BALANCE!' \n \nGod replied very wisely, 'Wait till you see the bunch of tossers I'm putting down South!",

Before the man can do anything, the doctor exclaims, \"Wait a second, before you do anything, I need to tell you something. YOUR BABY CAN FLY! Let me show you,\" So the doctor grabs the child, holds him a foot off of the operating table, and lets go. The baby lands on the metal table with a soft thump. The man is outraged, but the doctor says \"WAIT A SECOND! Just give me a chance!\" Before the man can react, the doctor grabs the kid and drops him from 6 feet above the floor, and he lands with a hard thud. One last time the doctor screams, \"LET ME SHOW YOU MY MAGIC!\" He then flings open the window and chucks the baby out.\nThe child does a 1080 flip and slams into the windshield of a parked car, shattering it. The man is now in tears, and he is about to beat the everloving shit out of the doctor, when the doctor says \"HAHA! Im just joking with you man, the kid was stillborn.\"",

I drove for just about two miles from home and my car engine started to overheat so I had to turn back to get another car. When I got home I found my husband in bed with our maid. I don't know what to do now. Please help!\n\nReply:\nDear Anonymous,\nOverheating of engine after such short distance can be caused by problems associated with the carburettor. You need to check your oil and water level in your engine before you start your journey. You must also make sure your car is serviced regularly to avoid problems in future. \nHope this helped you.",

This town was really just a dot along a highway and didn't get much traffic at all. There was one gas station, a diner, and a little dollar store with necessities and household items. \n\nShawn worked at the store, his first job. Shawn did stocking, and cleaning, and sometimes helped out on the register. It was an easy job and never too busy. \n\nThe town was so slow and lazy it was this dollar store's practice to close completely on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and did not reopen until the following Monday. That meant several days off for Shawn!\n\nOne Thanksgiving the store closed up as usual on Wednesday and everybody went home to their families for turkey day. Shawn went fishing with friends on Friday and they drove to Midland on Saturday to visit a few bars. It was a late night and Shawn didn't get to bed until late. \n\nEarly Sunday morning the phone rang and Shawn heard his boss's urgent voice: \"Shawn I need you up here at the store right away, we've got major problems!\"\n\nGroggily Shawn groaned. What could have happened to be so urgent!?\n\nShawn made his way to work and was astonished with what he saw. The front window was shattered and the store was a disaster. One aisle in particular seemed to have most of the damage. Piles of dishes from the dish section were scattered all over the floor. \n\nThere was a terrible stench with blood, guts, and feces everywhere and all over the broken dishes. A large deer lay dead in the middle of the aisle. \n\nShawn was aghast. What a mess. How did this happen?!\n\nThe manager had already assessed the events so he filled Shawn in: \"it looks like this deer was smacked by a car on the highway. In his delirium he smashed through the window and went nuts right here in the dish section. Now, it looks like we have \na wrecked aisle dish funk Shawn!\"\n\n",

I know it's weird and I would understand completely if you don't want to, but can you give me a hug and say 'Bye Mummy' to me?\" Inside I'm thinking WTF?!?!

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you. You\u2019re not a monk.\u201d The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you. You\u2019re not a monk.\u201d The man says, \u201cAll right, all right. I\u2019m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?\u201d The monks reply, \u201cYou must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.\u201d The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, \u201cI have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.\u201d The monks reply, \u201cCongratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.\u201d The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \u201cThe sound is right behind that door.\u201d The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, \u201cReal funny. May I have the key?\u201d The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire. So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks say, \u201cThis is the last key to the last door.\u201d The man is relieved to no end. He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound. But he can\u2019t tell you what it is because you\u2019re not a monk.",

So, we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving. I think we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today.\n\nMost of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell.\n\nWith birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added. This gives two possibilities.\n\n1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.\n\n2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.\n\nSo which is it?\n\nIf we accept the postulate given to me by Theresa during my freshman year that \"It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,\" and we take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over.\n\nThe corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, Theresa kept shouting, \"Oh my God.\"",

I think even internationally people have heard about me, though I'm not too sure about it (fortunately the people who know about me also tend to be technologically a bit behind the curve, so you don't find too many of them on the internet).\n\nAnyway, unlike many celebrities I never actually wanted to be famous - I always just wanted a quiet life, to be treated normally, have a loving family - that's basically the dream.\n\nThe worst is that I don't even have anything to say when it comes to my fame, it pretty much started out from something my parents did. I know, when you say 'celebrity' most people think of rockstars and actors or something, but that's not really my situation.\n\nMy homecountry had a bit of a terrorism problem, which you might think you understand from reading about terrorism a bit in the newspapers from time to time, but it's something entirely different when you live near it. People were scared. People were forced into the ranks of this terrorist group, they could choose, either join or die tortured and with the knowledge that you also sealed the death-sentence for your entire family. It was a pretty fucking dark chapter, that you can believe.\n\nWell, my parents were scared aswell. They were young, still in their twenties, and were targets of this terrorism just like everyone else (maybe even more so, because my mother was an educated woman from a minority of the population). But unlike the other people they didn't back down. When asked to join and or not to oppose, they fought back, when attacked the kept on fighting, and when threatened of getting them, their family and all friends murdered, they still didn't back down.\n\nThat's the kind of people they were.\n\nWere, because reality sadly isn't as fantastic as fiction, and reality doesn't care for its heroes. Shortly after I was born the danger became too much, they had to go into hiding, but the defense against terrorism is only as strong as the weakest link, and the weakest link in this case was a friend who caved in under the pressure. Looking back I think he was simply scared for his life and hoped that the protection offered in return for his betrayal would allow him to survive this whole mess, but I guess I'll never know. Anyway, they were found and executed.\n\nNow, without parents I had to grow up with some relatives. But the damage was already done - my parents, their opposition to the terror in the country had given the people hope, and the death of one of leaders of the terrorists around that time only helped this sentiment. Their name, my last name, it was known all around the country, as a symbol of hope to fight against the fanatics killing the people and poisoning our nation.\n\nSo, pretty big name to live up to, right? Well, there's the thing I regularly do, but feel bad about: I disguise myself and introduce myself with a pseudonym, so people don't recognize me on the streets. I know it dishonors my family a bit, and I tried for the first 18 years of my life not to do it, but the stares I received from everyone simply grew too much to handle.\n\nAnd that's why sometimes I use the last name of my godfather instead of my own, and introduce myself as 'Harrold Black' instead of 'Harry Potter'.\n\nBut yeah, what else is a person supposed to do in a situation like mine?",

He enters to find a dim, candle-lit room, Barry White softly playing in the background, and a thin, sexy blond in her underwear laying on the bed waiting for him. Having waited so long for this moment he wastes no time on foreplay; he pounces on her and begins to fuck away! \n\nAfter a few minutes of banging he comes, and realizes that there is semen coming out of every orifice of this woman--eyes, nose, ears, everywhere. He quickly gathers his belongings, thanks her and leaves. \n\nOn his way out the manager asks, \"Everything satisfactory?\" \"Oh yeah, it was great,\" replies the sailor, \"but I think you should get her to a doctor, I think something's wrong with her.\" \"Not to worry sir, we'll be sure to check on her. Have a great day and come again!\" \n\nAfter the sailor leaves the manager calls out to the janitor, \"Hey Bill, go down to room 3, the dead one's full again!\"",

We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don\u2019t know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except \u2026\u201d said the old man, and then he stopped. \u201cExcept what?\u201d asked the businessman. \u201cNothing, nothing,\u201d said the old man. \u201cC\u2019mon, tell me! I need something!\u201d protested the businessman. \u201cWell, sir, I don\u2019t usually mention this, but there is the \u2018voodoo dick,\u2019\u201d the old man said. \u201cSo what\u2019s up with this voodoo dick?\u201d the businessman asked.\u00a0 The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols.\u00a0 He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo.\u00a0 The businessman laughed, and said, \u201cBig fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!\u201d The old man said, \u201cBut you haven\u2019t seen what it\u2019ll do yet.\u201d He pointed to a door and said \u201cVoodoo dick, the door.\u201d The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole.\u00a0 The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle.\u00a0 Before the door could split, the old man said, \u201cVoodoo dick, get back in your box!\u201d The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, quiescent once more. The businessman said, \u201cI\u2019ll take it!\u201d The old man resisted and said it wasn\u2019t for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash.\u00a0 The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, \u201cVoodoo dick, my pussy.\u201d He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.\u00a0 After he\u2019d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny.\u00a0 She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said \u201cVoodoo dick, my pussy!\u201d\u00a0 The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping.\u00a0 It was great, like nothing she\u2019d ever experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she\u2019d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting.\u00a0 She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked.\u00a0 Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off.\u00a0 So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help.\u00a0 She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo.\u00a0\u00a0 On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman.\u00a0 He asked for her license, and then asked how much she\u2019d had to drink.\u00a0 Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn\u2019t been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn\u2019t stop screwing. The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, \u201cYea, right. Voodoo dick, my ass!\u201d",

I pray that you honour his life by allowing me to replace him in this duty.\u201d The bishop agreed to give the man an audition and, as the armless man's brother stooped to pick up a mallet to strike the first bell, he groaned clutched at his chest, twirled around, collapsed and died on the spot.\n\nTwo monks hearing the bishop's cries of grief at this second tragedy, rushed up the stairs to his side. \u201cWhat has happened ?

        "body": "First of all, - just for some background: My Mum died right when I was born, (she was actually really, really hot- but this isn't about her. I guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.\nAnyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.\nI don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn't make it for me- but I thought she was so fucking beautiful that I watched it twice. I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. (My dad's family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it).\nSooo... I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home.\nMy friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to fuck her brains out. Looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly.\nAfter we left, we all went to crash with my Sister's friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging. Pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I'm not saying that I'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.\nMy friend and my sister never hooked up I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was fucked up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.\nSadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart... and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her.\nBut I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh.\nA little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can't say I was surprised. But even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone.\nIt was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him.",

He sprays again and the rabbit flips over once and lays still.  He sprays it for a good minute and suddenly the rabbit springs to life!  It shakes it's head, smiles at the two standing there, gives a little wave and proceeds to hop down the highway.  After about twenty feet, the rabbit stops, turns and waves at them again then continues on his way.  The rabbit stops once again, turns and waves at the two and continues once again down the highway.  \n\nThe salesman and vegan watch the bunny hop away into the sunset as it stops every so often and wave back at them.\n\nWhen the rabbit is finally out of sight the vegan turns to the salesman \"That was beautiful and amazing!

He went and saw that he looked like a good player so he decided to bring him back to Liverpool on a trial for the rest of the season.\nHussain trained and played with the Under 21's for the season. Meanwhile, Liverpool's fortunes were changing as they started to win more games. It went down to the last game of the season where they were playing against rivals Manchester United, which they had to win to become league champions. Klopp had seen good things from Hussain in training, so he decided to promote to the first team bench.\nThe match started horribly for Liverpool and they were 2-0 down at half time. Klopp was enraged as he gave the team talk in the dressing room before the players went out for the second half. He then decided that he would give Hussain his first appearance as a last throw of the dice to see if he could make something happen. \nThe second half started and within minutes Liverpool were on the attack, running down the wing into a crossing position. The ball was whipped in to the box and Hussain, with his first touch of the ball, struck a sweet volley which nestled into the top corner. Suddenly, the fans started to sing as they started to believe that the impossible may happen. The game went on and in the 80th minute they had another chance as the ball again went down the wing and another whipped cross met Hussain, and this time a perfect header left the keeper with no chance and the score was 2-2 and now it seemed more than ever that they could do it. It was the last minute of injury time when Hussain picked up the ball in the middle of the pitch. He swivelled in and out through 4 players, when he was then taken down in the box. The ref gave a penalty, and Hussain stepped up to take it. There was never any doubt as he coolly slotted it away to complete the hat trick and the win for Liverpool, giving them their first league title in 27 years.\nThe stadium erupted in joy as they finally did it, after years of disappointment. Klopp was over the moon with Hussain and promised him a new contract in a few days as well as a brand new car, and asked if he wanted anything else. Hussain asked to phone home to tell them what had happened, so klopp took him straight to his office to use the phone. Hussain phoned home, and his mum picked up and Hussain, as excited as ever told her everything that had just occurred. As soon as he finished, his mum in a sad voice said that he should come home. Hussain, sensing something was wrong, asked what was going on. His mum then told him about how his dad has been caught in some crossfire and was hit by a bullet, and she had been mugged and his sister had been raped. Hussain started sobbing and said that he was sorry that all this had happened, and his mother replied 'well you should be, considering you're the one who brought us to Liverpool'.",

I knew he was fucked up the second I saw him. His head twitched from person to person constantly and couldn't keep his attention on anything for more than a few seconds at a time. All I could do was grin and bear it. We loaded in the car and took off. I spent close to 30 minutes trying to talk to him and get directions, but he was so far gone he could barely keep up. His eyes darted everywhere and he seemed to drift into his own world every time I'd ask him where I was supposed to turn. I finally got him to his house and sped back to the job,  mad that I had to deal with his worthless self. As I walked into the dealership, I looked for the service writer to complain that he made me drive him, and found him at his desk. I said \"Damn, man. I hate driving people like that!\" He looked at me with the most suprised face I've ever seen and said \" What, deaf people?\"",

I just knew the guy was in my apartment, but I couldn't find him. I looked everywhere and was just about to give up, when I went out on the balcony of my 23rd story apartment and there he was hanging over the edge! He was just barely hanging on, there was no way he could climb back onto the balcony. It was a really stupid place to try to hide. I was livid, so I started punching him and clawing at his fingers, but he held on. Finally I went to get a hammer and started pounding on his fingers, and he fell down. But what really angered me was that he landed in some bushes and fell to the ground dazed, but basically OK! I was so mad I grabbed the refrigerator, threw it off the balcony and it landed on him. Unfortunately I was so riled up by the incident I had a heart attack and died.\"\n\nSt. Peter was taken aback, and said \"While you did die in a dramatic fashion, I think we need to look at that whole second degree murder before we let you in - off to limbo with you.\" He then approached the second man and asked him how he had died.\n\n\"I was riding my exercise bike on the balcony of my 24th story apartment, when the thing broke and threw me over the railing! I grabbed furiously at the railing and slipped, but managed to catch on the balcony below mine. I tried to climb up but it just wasn't possible. I thought I was going to fall but then someone came out on the balcony. I thought he would help me, until he started hitting me! I held on as best I could, but when he got a hammer and started hitting me I finally couldn't hold on anymore and fell. Somehow, though, I fell in some bushes and fell to the ground dazed, but basically OK! Just as I'm coming around, I look up and BAM this refrigerator lands on me. So here I am.\"\n\nSt. Peter immediately admitted this second man to heaven, and pulled aside the third man and asked him for his story.\n\n\"Picture this: I'm hiding naked in a refrigerator...\"",

When Mr. Stevenson was eight years old, he asked another little boy if he would like a Hurts Donut. The other boy said yes. So he hit him on the arm and he said, \"Hurts Donut.\" Five years later, Mr. Stevenson asked another boy about his same age at that time if he would like a Hurts Donut. when the boy said yes, Mr. Stevenson stabbed him over and over again in his eye and his cheek with a pencil, saying \"Hurts Donut.\" Over the years, Mr. Stevenson did very well in school. On graduation day, he was sat next to another young man, who, like Mr. Stevenson, had earned high marks. When he asked the boy if he would like a Hurts Donut, the boy said, \"Not if you're gonna stab me in the eye with a pencil.\" \"I wouldn't even touch you,\" said Mr. Stevenson. So when the boy agreed, he presented him with a photograph of the young man's fianc\u00e9e at a bachelor party, on some guy's table, fucking herself with a beer bottle. As tears filled the young man's eyes, Mr. Stevenson was heard to say, \"Hurts Donut.\" A few years later, Mr. Stevenson got a job as a sales clerk in an electronics store. Within a year, he was caught stealing and immediately incarcerated. When he asked his cellmate if he would like a Hurts Donut, his cellmate said yeah. So... he gave him a Hurts Donut. Over the years, Mr. Stevenson grew too old to take care of himself, so they put him in a hospital. One day, he asked the new nurse if she would like a Hurts Donut. In anticipation of her response, Mr. Stevenson began humming and making smacking noises with his mouth. When the nurse smiled and said, \"I know about you, Mr. Stevenson,\" Mr. Stevenson blurted out something totally incoherent and... and began to laugh.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/44v24f/graffiti_out_side_of_levi_stadium_after_its/czta8lq",

She then looked deeply into my eyes and spoke to me softly.   \n\n\"Well I'm 20 years old and well, I've never been fucked...\"   \n\nI smiled at her and caressed her beautiful blonde hair. My hands ran down her sides as I moved my fingers to undo the buckle for the wheelchair.   \nThen I tossed her and the wheelchair over the railing into the bay.   \n\n\"You've just been fucked my dear! \"",

        "body": "Once upon a time, in a land not so very far away, there lived a village of people.  Funny little people called Loons.\n\nThe Loons were a peaceful people, a simple people, with a very simple diet.  The Loons could eat but one thing, and loved that one thing: Pure cane sugar.  Because of this, sugar was very precious to the Loons.\n\nThese happy people weren't without their troubles, however.  In fact, there was a blight upon the land in which they dwelt, in the form of a vicious, predatory monster.  The Medigrim.  This swift and cunning beast would come into the village in the dead of night, snatch a little Loon, and scamper off to have its meal.\n\nThe Loons attempted to dissuade the creature, of course. Unfortunately, they weren't equipped for violence, and weren't the brightest of groups, so attempts landed in failure.  They tried an offering of the only food they knew, sugar, which got ignored by the carnivore.  They tried launching a rock at it with a rudimentary catapult, but succeeded only in launching a Loon instead.  \n\nThese failed attempts at dissuading the beast repeated until one day, a clever little Loon came up with a clever little idea.  They could set a trap with the beast, and bait it so that the Medigrim was tempted to fall for it!  The village agreed, and set to digging.  They dug that hole all day until it was so deep they were sure the Medigrim could not get out.  Of course, that's where the plan faltered, because of course, the bait of choice was the only food to cross their minds.  Sugar!  So they filled that hole with lots and lots of sugar! So much sugar they were sure the hungry Medigrim would not notice he was trapped because he was busy devouring it all!  Satisfied with their work at the end of the day, the village slept.\n\nAt least... most of them did.  That night, a naughty little Loon woke up in the middle of the night, snuck out of his hut, and went to go to the trap.  The trap was still there, set and full of sugar.  The Loon's stomach growled.  He thought to himself, \"oh, a bite, a taste, that couldn't hurt, right?\"  So he stepped into the hole, which was so full of sugar the top was barely below the surface.  He took his bite... and then another, and another, and on and on until he realized that he had eaten it all!  He looked up, and found that he was stuck at the bottom of the hole, beyond the reach of his jump or climb.\n\nIt was at that moment that he saw something else, something dreadful.  The Medigrim stared from above, its eyes mad with hunger.  It pounced, and gobbled that Loon up!  But in its hunger, it too made the same mistake that the Loon had before it.  It was stuck at the bottom of the trap.\n\nThe next morning, two things happened.  The others noticed the naughty Loon was missing, and the trap was discovered to have worked.  They saw the corpse of the deceased, and were very sad.  However, the sadness soon changed to praise, as he was lauded a hero of the Loons for sacrificing himself to get rid of this danger once and for all!  A statue was raised in his likeness, and the village celebrated this Loon!  Soon after, songs were dedicated to his memory.  In fact, if you listen carefully, you might recognize it - it goes like this:  \"Just a Loon full of sugar help the Medigrim go down!\"",

This tastes just like gin!\"  The bartender tells him to turn it around and take a bite.  \"Whoa! Tastes just like tonic!  This is amazing!\"\nA third man walks into the bar.  Before he can even order a drink, the two other men sitting at the bar say, \"Hey this bartender has an apple for anything\" \"Yea! He has one for every flavor!\"  The third man responds, \"Oh really? Any flavor?\"  He turns to the bartender and says, \"Give me an apple that tastes like pussy.\"  The men all laugh until the bartender takes out an apple and places it in front of him.  Everyone watches as the man picks up the apple, slowly raises it to him mouth, and takes a bite.  Immediately he spits it out and shouts \"What the hell!  That tastes like shit!\"  The bartender responds \"Turn it around\".",

You name it, you got it\" now the son was turning 12 so the father figured it would be a game system and some games but all the son wanted was one pink ping pong ball. The dad followed up on his promise and got the son what he wanted. Next year came 13 and his dad told him the same thing. But this time the son wanted a little more. \"Two pink ping pong balls dad\" the dad was very confused. He owns one of the biggest businesses in America and can buy anything but his son is so easy to please. He buys  the balls but tells his son \"I will give these to you but first, can I know what you are doing with them?\" The son says \"please dad. Can I just have them?\" The father hands over the balls. These keeps happening for a few years and before his 16th birthday his dad asks again. This time the answer changes a little bit. \"Dad I think I want a garbage truck this year. Full of pink ping pong balls\" the father very confused asked\" son what would you do with all of those balls?\" The son just says \"please dad. I just really want them.\" The dad begins to worry because he is close to having 50 ping pong balls already but they seem to just disappear but he gets his son the truck full and his son is in the truck for a few days and comes back home but all the ping pong balls are gone. On his 17th birthday the dad tells him that he can have anything except pink ping pong balls. \"But dad I was kind of hoping you would buy me a ware house full of pink ping pong balls this year.\" The dad angry at first yells at the son. \" I can get you anything but if all you want is stupid ping pong balls then so be it.\" So the dad buys the warehouse and has it filled with pink ping pong balls. 6 million balls to be exact. He drops his son off because he wants to spend the night there and when the father picks up his son the next morning all the pink ping pong balls are gone. The dad is so furious he just takes the son home and grounds him. 11 months go by and the son is in a horrific traffic accident and is left in critical condition. With 12 hours before  he turns 18 the doctor tells his dad \"I'm not sure he will make it through the night\" the dad starts crying but wants the son to have a good last birthday so he goes in the room and asks his son \"what would you like for your birthday this year?\" The son says \"dad... Can you get me... *cough* one pink ping pong ball?\" The dad says yes and goes to the store to buy his son one last gift. As he hands the boy the ball he says \"son please tell me what you are doing with all of these balls.\" His son says \"okay. You have been fair my whole life so I owe it to you to tell you.

She decides to seek help from the cockpit, and explains the situation to the captain and the co-pilot.\n\nThe co-pilot, upset by the nerve of the blonde volunteers to handle it, and goes back to the woman who was now enjoying champagne in her stolen seat and explains: \n\n\"Miss, that's an economy ticket, so I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to find your seat in the back.  Our first class cabin is reserved for folks who have paid the first class fare in full.\"\n\nThe blonde gives the same response as she did to the flight attendant, and her nerve shakes the co-pilot.  Dumbfounded, a little smitten by her beauty, and unable to respond, he returns to the captain and the flight attendant to report the situation.\n\nThe captain, looks back at the woman and turns to the co-pilot and flight attendant saying, \"No worries guys.  My wife's a blonde, I can handle this.\"\n\nThe flight attendant and co-pilot watch from the cockpit as the captain casually saunters up to the blonde, leans over and whispers something to her.  The blonde looks stunned, collects her things, downs the champagne and scurries sheepishly back into the economy cabin.  The captain cooly returns to the cockpit and takes his seat again.\n\nThe co-pilot asks the captain:  \"Sir, what did you say to convince her to go back?\"\n\nThe captain chuckles and responds, \"It was easy.  I just told her first class doesn't go all the way to San Francisco.\"",

He asks \"How can I ever repay you?\"\n\nThe genie just has this request: That the man make the most of his life and live like no man has lived before; love like no man has loved before; and care like no man has cared before. The man obliges.\n\nHe first sets out to find his \"calling\". Over the years, he works many jobs. He finds himself becoming depressed with the monotony that he has come to know. Finally, he decides to go back to his roots and do what he knows. He becomes a farmer. With the money he has accumulated from his many professions, he buys a large farm where he decides to take in unwanted and ill animals. Goats (obviously), pigs, cows, cats, dogs, and various other animals. He cares for them. He comes to know and understand them. He has a deep connection with them.\n\nOne day, a woman brings her dog to the man's farm. She is worried about the dog. She says ever since the dog's sibling died, he hasn't seemed right. The man agrees to take the dog and care for it. He knows the other animals will comfort it and the dog will enjoy his new family. The woman comes to visit the dog regularly. She becomes familiar with all of the other animals on the farm, and most of all, the man. They spend hours together each visit. Talking and taking care of the animals together. Hours turn to days. Days to weeks. The man asks the woman to live with him and his animals. The woman obliges. They are in love. They are truly happy.\n\nThe genie comes to the man one night in his dreams. The genie says to the man \"You have lived like no other man; you have loved like no other man; and you have cared like no other man. You have done well\".\n\nThe man wakes up the next morning and he doesn't feel well. He can't explain it, but somethings not right. Weeks go by and the man's condition seems to worsen. His doctors cannot explain his rapidly deteriorating health. The woman is always by his side when she's not caring for his animals. The woman's dog sleeps at the foot of his bed. Never leaving. At last, it seems like he cannot hold on for much longer. He's barely able to speak at this point. He motions for the woman to come near. He says to her \"Do you want to know why I fell in love with you all those years ago? Do you want to know why I love you more and more every day?\"\n\nShe says, \"Yes, my love, tell me.\"\n\nWith his final breath, he tells her \"Because you make me feel like a kid again.\"",

        "body": "(Sorry for the wall of text.  This was and email that a cow worker sent me.)\n\nWhen you occasionally have a really bad day, \nand you just need to take it out on someone, \ndon't take it out on someone you know, \ntake it out on someone you don't know, \nbut you know deserves it. \n       \nI was sitting at my desk when I remembered \na phone call I'd forgotten to make. \n      \nI found the number and dialed it. \n     \nA man answered, saying 'Hello.' \n      \nI politely said, 'This is Chris. \nCould I please speak with Robyn Carter?' \n      \nSuddenly a manic voice yelled out in my ear \n'Get the right f***ing number!' \nAnd the phone was slammed down on me. \n       \nI couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude. \n     \nWhen I tracked down Robyn's correct number to call her, \nI found that I had accidentally transposed the last two digits. \n      \nAfter hanging up with her, I decided to call the 'wrong' number again. \n      \nWhen the same guy answered the phone, I yelled 'You're an asshole!' \nAnd hung up. \n      \nI wrote his number down with the word 'asshole' next to it, \nAnd put it in my desk drawer. \n       \nEvery couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, \nI'd call him up and yell, \n'You're an asshole!' \n     \nIt always cheered me up. \n      \nWhen Caller ID was introduced, \nI thought my therapeutic 'asshole' \ncalling would have to stop. \n      \nSo, I called his number and said, \n'Hi, this is John Smith from the telephone company. \nI'm calling to see if you're familiar with our Caller ID Program?' \n         \nHe yelled 'NO!' \nAnd slammed down the phone. \n      \nI quickly called him back and said, \n'That's because you're an asshole!' And hung up. \n     \nOne day I was at the store, \ngetting ready to pull into a parking spot. \n     \nSome guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot\nI had patiently waited for. \n      \nI hit the horn and yelled that I'd been waiting for that spot, \nbut the idiot ignored me. \n      \nI noticed a 'For Sale' sign in his back window, \nso I wrote down his number. \n      \nA couple of days later, right after calling the first asshole \n(I had his number on speed dial) \nI thought that I'd better call the BMW asshole, too. \n     \nI said, \n'Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?' \n       \nHe said, 'Yes, it is.' \n      \nI then asked, \n'Can you tell me where I can see it?' \n     \nHe said, \n'Yes, I live at  34 Oaktree Blvd. , in  Fairfax   \nIt's a yellow ranch style house And the car's parked right out in front.' \n      \nI asked, \n'What's your name?' \n     \nHe said, \n'My name is Don Hansen.' \n         \nI asked, \n'When's a good time to catch you, Don?' \n      \nHe said, \n'I'm home every evening after five.' \n     \nI said, \n'Listen, Don, can I tell you something?' \n     \nHe said, \n'Yes?' \n      \nI said, \n'Don, you're an asshole!' \n      \nThen I hung up, \nand added his number to my speed dial, too. \n       \nNow, when I had a problem, \nI had two assholes to call. \n     \nThen I came up with an idea .... \n      \nI called asshole #1. \n      \nHe said, \n'Hello' \n     \nI said, \n'You're an asshole!' \n(But I didn't hang up.) \n     \nHe asked, \n'Are you still there?' \n       \nI said, \n'Yeah!' \n      \nHe screamed, \n'Stop calling me' \n      \nI said, \n'Make me.' \n       \nHe asked, \n'Who are you?' \n     \nI said, \n'My name is Don Hansen.' \n    \nHe said, \n'Yeah? Where do you live?' \n       \nI said, \n'Asshole, I live at 34 Oaktree Blvd., in Fairfax, \na yellow ranch style home and \nI have a black Beamer parked in front.' \n       \nHe said, \n'I'm coming over right now, Don. \nAnd you had better start saying your prayers.' \n       \nI said, \n'Yeah, like I'm really scared, asshole,' \nand hung up. \n     \nThen I called Asshole #2. \n      \nHe said, \n'Hello?' \n      \nI said, \n'Hello, asshole,' \n      \nHe yelled, \n'If I ever find out who you are ....' \n      \nI said, \n'You'll what?' \n      \nHe exclaimed, \n'I'll kick your ass' \n      \nI answered, \n'Well, asshole, here's your chance. \nI'm coming over right now.' \n     \nThen I hung up and immediately called the police, \nsaying that I was on my way over to 34 Oaktree Blvd, in Fairfax, to kill my gay lover. \n       \nThen I called Channel 7 News \nabout the gang war going down in Oaktree Blvd in Fairfax.\nI quickly got into my car and headed over to Fairfax. \n     \nI got there just in time to watch two assholes \nbeating the crap out of each other \nin front of six cop cars, an overhead news helicopter \nand surrounded by a news crew. \n       \nNOW, I feel much better!\n     \nI guess that anger management really does work.\n",

They must be saved. I will give $50,000 to the fire department that brings them out intact.\"\n       \nBut the roaring flames held the firefighters off.\n     \nSoon more fire departments had to be called in as the situation became desperate. As the firemen arrived, the president shouted out that the offer was now $100,000 to the fire department who could bring out the company's secret files.\n      \nFrom the distance, a lone siren was heard as another fire truck came into sight. It was the nearby Norwegian rural township volunteer fire company composed mainly of Norwegians over the age of 65. To everyone's amazement, that little run-down fire engine roared right past all the newer sleek engines that were parked outside the plant.\n     \nWithout even slowing down it drove straight into the middle of the inferno. Outside, the other firemen watched as the Norwegian old timers jumped off right in the middle of the fire fought it back on all sides. It was a performance and effort never seen before.\n      \nWithin a short time, the Norske old timers had extinguished the fire and had saved the secret formulas. The grateful chemical company president announced that for such a superhuman feat he was upping the reward to $200,000, and walked over to personally thank each of the brave fire fighters.\n      \nThe local TV news reporter rushed in to capture the event on film, asking their chief, \"What are you going to do with all that money?\"\n      \n\"Vell,\" said Ole Larsen, the 70-year-old fire chief, \"Da first thing ve gonna do is fix da brakes on dat truck!\"",

If you can ring that for me every day precisely at noon, I will pay you $20 a day. Can you do that for me?\"\nThe no armed man hesitates, but the offer of $20 a day sounds too promising, so he agrees. \n\nLater that day, he makes his way up to the bell tower but alas, cannot pull the rope for obvious reasons. However, he does not give up. Being a quick thinker, the man takes a stance in front of the bell, and begins repeatedly bashing his face into the bell. Success! the bell rings on the strike of noon, and a slightly dizzy no armed man returns downstairs, where a very confused pastor lives up to his promise and grants him $20.\n\nThis process continues for several weeks. Every day at noon, the man would head to the bell tower and bash his face into the solid metal for it to chime, and then the pastor would pay him. Over time, however, this method began damaging the mans head, both inside and out. Bruises were always constant, and the pastor began noticing the man would slur his speech, look deranged and have trouble walking in a straight line. But there were no complaints, and the man, though a bit slower by the day, was still getting paid happily, so it continued.\n\nOn one fateful day, however, the man once again staggers up the stairs to reach the bell tower as noon approached. He took his normal stance, ready to smash his head once again into the giant chiming machine. However, on this fateful day, he succumbs to the damage, and as he charges at the bell, he staggers so much that he completely misses the target. His momentum takes him right over the shallow wall of the tower and he plummets to the ground. He is killed instantly.\n \nA crowd of people begin to gather around the no armed man's body, including a police officer. A woman looks at the body, horrified, and asks \"Oh my god, does anybody know who this man is?\" The police officer looks at the dead man and replies \"I don't know him, but his face rings a bell.\"",

His forehead is all bloody and bruised and he is crying uncontrollably. \n\nThe young monk asks the old abbot, \"What's wrong, father?\" \n\nThe old abbot replies, \"The word was CELEBRATE!\"",

Then his face fell. \"Something happen to him? Is he okay?\"\n\n\"No, rabbi, no. But he comes back from the trip, and he tells me he is a Christian now!\"\n\nThe rabbi puts his arm around him. \"This is a terrible thing, Shlomo. But, I.. I hate aspersions to be casting here, but there are questions I must ask, nu? Have you been keeping bacon in your fridge, or had shrimp at a party? Perhaps not quite tithing everything from your business?\"\n\nShlomo looks back at the rabbi, hurt. \"I would do no such thing, and neither would his dear mother.\" \"I know, I know\" said the rabbi quickly, patting his arm. \"But there are questions I must be asking. It doesn't just happen that a good Jewish boy suddenly becomes a Christian. Especially in the Holy Land! Let us go to the head rabbi.\"\n\nSo together they go and explain the whole business to the head rabbi, an ancient man known for his wisdom and learning. The man asks them both \"Is there some rule you broke perhaps? Driving somewhere on a Saturday? Did you let him get a tattoo?\" and the two men swear this is not the case and tear their clothes. The head rabbi says \"this is a most serious case. I know of a man in Jersualem, a great great man who can speak directly to... (pointing upwards) but will only do so if absolutely necessary and all other avenues have been explored, which is why these questions I am asking. Shlomo, it will go very very badly for you if you are lying in any way, this is the only reason I am being like this.\"\n\nSo they all go off to Jerusalem to meet with the special, special rabbi. He solemnly starts asking the questions, and they say \"look, the joke is already going on too long here, let's move to the punchline\" so the rabbi goes \"OK OK OK, you understand the questions I must be asking!\" and they all yell \"WE'VE DONE ALL THAT!\"\n\nSo he puts on his special robes, lights the incense, does all the requisite things and enters the inner tabernacle and throws his hands outwards, calling out to God. \n\n\"I come to you today on behalf of our friend Shlomo, who is in terrible pain. His son came here, to the Holy Land, and became a Christian. The pain to his poor mother! Tell us, please, what for must we be doing?\"\n\nAnd this voice comes down from above. \"**Me**, you are asking? Oy, vey.....\"\n",

They can't figure her out. She's very pleasant and a gracious winner. \nThey invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.\nThe third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys.

However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play,they can't hold a grudge.\nThis woman is a riddle no one can figure out. They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse, and finally, one of the men asks her, \"How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?\" \nThe lady blushes, and grins. \"When my Dad taught me to play golf, I learned I was ambidextrous,\" she replies. \"I like to switch back and forth. \"When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him.

He was out on deployment for long periods of time, and being a ship without women, he was naturally frisky.\n\nThey arrived at an island to resupply and the crew were given leave - so he makes his way to the nearest tavern and enquires of the barmaid\n\n'Where can I find a brothel around here?'\n\nTo which the barmaid replies\n\n\"I'm afraid you won't find any such establishment around here. Missionaries came through several years back and we've all but converted.\"\n\nHe left the bar and began aimlessly wandering around the island. As night fell he decided to climb one last hill before heading back to the ship. As he reached the crest of the hill, he noticed a shack all alone with a sign reading:\n\n\"Singing blowjobs: $5\"\n\nExcitedly he knocks on the door. The door opens and a little old lady looks up at him. He recoils a little and thinks to himself that maybe this wasn't such a good idea. The old lady grins and asks\n\n\"Ooooh. Here for the singing blowjob are we?\".\n\n'N-no. I have the wrong place, sorry' he stammers.\n\n\"Ooooh no, you'll be wanting the blowjob. Come on in. Come on\", she says.\n\nHe hands her the $5 and enters the shack. The door closes to veritable darkness and he unzips his fly. The singing begins and the lady goes to work to a resounding crescendo. Baffled by how such a thing is possible he asks\n\n'How were you able to do that?!'\n\n\"Old family secret\" she laughs, half speaking to herself.\n\nRelieved but curious, he leaves and returns the next evening. He knocks on the door and the old woman answers\n\n\"Back again are we? I expect you'll be after the singing blowjob!\" she enquires.\n\n'Yes, yes. Here is the $5' he says, handing the money over and closing the door behind him. The singing begins and an amazing blowjob follows. He enquires again how such a thing is possible, only to be met with the same reply.\n\nThe next day the ship leaves port and they sail out on their next mission. He tells all his friends of the singing blowjob, to which most of them laugh and mock him. He remains adamant it was real and that he'd find out the secret.\n\nYears pass and they chance upon the same island again. The ship docks and he runs to the hilltop to find the shack standing there, with the same sign.\n\nHe knocks on the door and the old woman answers again. She looks up at him, and then realisation lights up in her eyes\n\n\"Ooooh! I remember you. You'll be wanting the singing blowjob! Come in, come in!\", she says.\n\n'No, I just want to know how you do it!' he demands.\n\n\"Family secret, can't tell. Can't tell\" she replies, smiling and laughing to herself.\n\n'Alright, alright. Here is your money' he says, determined to uncover the truth. He hands her the money and heads inside the dark shack. The singing begins and he tries to focus on his surroundings, looking for a radio or television -- anything which might produce the sound. Before long he is lost in the ecstasy and forgets all about looking. The woman finishes the job, and he leaves.\n\nFrustrated and adamant to uncover the truth, he decides to bring a torch with him the following evening to finally get to the bottom of the family secret.\n\nThe following evening he rushes up the hill with a torch in his back pocket. Knocking on the door, he is received by the old woman again\n\n\"Back again are we? The singing blowjob it will be?\" she grins.\n\n'Fine. Yes. Here is your money' he says, pushing the money at her and closing the door behind him. The singing begins and the woman goes to work. For a moment he nearly loses himself to the feeling and forgets to look around.\n\nRegaining his senses, he fumbles in his back pocket and pulls the torch out. Flicking it on, he casts it down to the table in front of him and the first thing he sees - a glass eyeball.",

The two hikers, alarmed by his distraught appearance, watch him as he approaches. \n\n\nAs it turns out, the man has been lost up on top of the mountain for weeks.

So, naturally, this man asks the two hikers' for one of their burgers. \n\n\nThe two hikers look at each other, look back at the shaggy mountain man, and refuse. They have been hiking for hours without food, you see, and are very hungry. \n\n\nThe shaggy mountain man is desperate, and refuses to take no for an answer. So he comes up with this. He offers the two hikers to play a game for one of the burgers. If he wins, he gets one of the delicious burgers. If he loses, he walks away and they never see him again. The game is 20 Questions. \n\n\nThe two hikers turn to the side to discuss it. \n\n\"Okay, let's just come up with something this guy will never guess in a million years.\"\n\n\"Yeah fine, but like what?\"\n\n\"How about... moose cock?\"\n\n\"Wow, good for you. Yeah okay. Lets do it.\"\n\n\nSo the turn hikers go back to the shaggy mountain man and say they are ready to play the game.\n\n\"Alright fellas. First rule of 20 Questions,\" the mountain man asks, \"Can you eat it?\"\n\nThe two hikers look at each other in amusement. \"Uhh, yeah, yeah, I guess you can eat it,\" says one of the hikers.\n\nThe mountain man takes a big deep breathe and pauses for some time. Then finally, in one exhausted breathe, he replies, .....\n\n \"Is it moose cock?!\"\n\nThe shaggy mountain then enjoyed his juicy burger while the two hikers stood in disbelief.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is the moose cock joke. \n\n\n\n",

They asked for volunteers. The representative from Greece stood up and shared how one of their own should be on the island because the Greeks are great at fishing and cooking seafood. Then the German delegate stood up and shared that Germans are great engineers and builders so they should be on the island to build the infrastructure. Finally the Japanese delegate stood and said they are great at moving goods and logistics so there should be someone from Japan on the island. \n\nThe Greeks volunteered their finest chef who was in charge of all the food. The Germans their best engineer who was in charge of building and maintaing the habitat. The Japanese their top logistics person who was solely in charge of supplies. They were shipped to the island for a year with strict orders to work together. \n\nAfter the year was up the UN assembly sailed out to the island. They first saw a huge house that was meticulously built by the German. They were impressed. Welcoming them inside the home them was a large feast caught and cooked by the Greek. The Japanese representative, however, was nowhere to be found. When they asked the whereabouts of the Japanese representative the Greek and German said he took off into the jungle as soon as they arrived never to be heard from again. The UN immediately sent out a search team. The team was walking down a trail looking for the Japanese representative when all of a sudden he dropped down in front of them out of the tallest tree on the island and shouted \"SUPPLIES!\"",

Bullwinkle, the town's leading citizen, had been smashed flatter than a kippered herring by a falling safe.\n\n\"It's a common enough means of death for cartoon characters,\" Fenwick opined. \"Every year, we lose five or six citizens to falling safes. But this time, it was no accident. This time, it's murder!\"\n\nHe showed Feghoot the ingenious deadfall trap rigged to rain financial ruin on an unsuspecting victim. Bullwinkle's antlers were still entangled in the tripwire. Grasped tightly in one hand was a small statue of a Hindu god.\n\nThe dead quadruped's best friend, Rocky the flying squirrel had been with Bullwinkle at the time of his death, but when questioned by Feghoot, the distraught rodent said all he could remember was seeing a rabbi fleeing the scene upon a pogo stick.\n\nFenwick immediately issued an APB for the rabbi.\n\n\"You're wasting your time, Fenwick,\" said Feghoot grimly, as he stood from his examination of the body. \"The rabbi has been framed. When you find him, he will tell you of some elaborate ruse that induced him to be on a pogo stick at this time and place.\"\n\n\"How do you know that, Feghoot?\" asked the Inspector.\n\n\"This is the work of the Christmas Killer,\" Feghoot declared. \"I have been on the trail of this fiend for years, and I fear that we might never catch him. Every December, he arranges one of these grisly messages.\"\n\n\"Look! Didn't you notice the smile on the victim's face? The corners of his mouth have been propped up... by these!\" He displayed two toothpicks he had taken from Bullwinkle's mouth.\n\n\"I still don't see how you know the murderer is the Christmas Killer,\" said Fenwick.\n\n\"Isn't it obvious?\" Feghoot asked. \"Wee Vishnu, a merry crushed moose, and a hoppy Jew near.\"",

However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.\nFinally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.'\nThe father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.'\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball.\nThe boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again.\nThe next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday.\n'Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.'\nThe father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, `If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.'\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.\nThe boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again.\nThe next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday.\n'Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.'\nThe father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?'\n'A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed.\n'I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.'\nAnd so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls.\nThe boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.\n'Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?'\nThe son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humour me, dear father.'\nThe carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again.\nThe next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday.\n'Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.'\nOne of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory.\nThe next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home.\nThe following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left.\nThe following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong.\n'Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.'\nIt was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country.\nThe next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there.\n'Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.'\nThat night, the son spent on board the tanker.\nThe next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy.\nA few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital.\nHis father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?'\nWeakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.'\nThe father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.'\n'Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.'\nThe father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk.\n'Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.'\nThe son nodded weakly.\nThe next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room.\n'Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,' the father requested.\nThe son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter.\n`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.\n`I- I-'\nThen he died.",

It was like a second family for me.\nOne day, neither of them were home. Their parents thought they were with me, but I thought they were with them. We went off searching all the spots we could think of. They were missing for 3 days. I gave up looking on the third day, and went back to my house, wanting to relax after worrying so much. I walk in and there's Love, sitting on my couch, crying. I ask her everything. Apparently they had been kidnapped and were going to be held for ransom, but Hope tried to be a hero and take down the man holding them captive. She was shot down and killed in an instant. After she told me this I tried comforting her the best I could. But I couldn't help but think to myself...\nWe found Love in a Hope-less place...",

Period.\n\nJOHN McCAIN: My friends, the chicken crossed the road because he recognized the need to engage in cooperation and dialogue with all the chickens on the other side of the road.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON: What difference at this point does it make why the chicken crossed the road?\n\nGEORGE W. BUSH: We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. The chicken is either with us or against us. There is no middle ground here.\n\nDICK CHENEY: Where's my gun?\n\nBILL CLINTON: I did not cross the road with that chicken.\n\nAL GORE: I invented the chicken.\n\nJOHN KERRY: Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against it! It was the wrong road to cross, and I was misled about the chicken's intentions. I am not for it now, and will remain against it.\n\nAL SHARPTON: Why are all the chickens white?\n\nDR. PHIL: The problem we have here is that this chicken won't realize that he must first deal with the problem on this side of the road before it goes after the problem on the other side of the road. What we need to do is help him realize how stupid he is acting by not taking on his current problems before adding any new problems.\n\nOPRAH: Well, I understand that the chicken is having problems, which is why he wants to cross the road so badly. So instead of having the chicken learn from his mistakes and take falls, which is a part of life, I'm going to give this chicken a NEW CAR so that he can just drive across the road and not live his life like the rest of the chickens.\n\nANDERSON COOPER: We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road.\n\nNANCY GRACE: That chicken crossed the road because he's guilty! You can see it in his eyes and the way he walks.\n\nPAT BUCHANAN: To steal the job of a decent, hardworking American.\n\nMARTHA STEWART: No one called me to warn me which way the chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer's Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider information.\n\nDR SEUSS: Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I've not been told.\n\nERNEST HEMINGWAY: To die in the rain, alone.\n\nGRANDPA: In my day we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.\n\nBARBARA WALTERS: Isn't that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heartwarming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish its lifelong dream of crossing the road.\n\nARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.\n\nBILL GATES: I have just released eChicken2014, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents and balance your checkbook. Internet Explorer is an integral part of eChicken2014.

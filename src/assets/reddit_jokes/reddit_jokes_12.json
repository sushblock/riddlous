And by professional I mean \"full-time job,\" not the \"I do drunk open-mic nights\" type.\n\nThere was an understanding in the industry. If your shit is funny, it will be stolen. It was part of the game. But just like musicians or any other artists, if someone else does it better, then you have to cede to them. If you're a singer, someone covers your song and effin kills it, you let them. Do you think anyone calls Johnny Cash a \"song thief\" when he recorded NIN's \"Hurt?\" Of course not. Because he took the material and made it his. Comedy is the same way. One of my best sets included a bit (about Pokemon and orphans) that killed every time. One guy who I knew from the circuit came up to me and told me that he was using my bit and asked me if I wanted to compare notes. I watched him perform and he took it to a whole new level. Never used it again because he performed it so much better than I ever could. The bastard.\n\nI'm guilty of it too. You usually have to when you're starting. When you get up there for the first time at open-mics and you're trying to find your voice, new content is one of the the last things on your mind. You spend about two minutes making it up and about two months working it into your act. That story that always makes your friends piss themselves laughing? It'll be about six weeks before you realize the audience thinks it (and you) are retarded for using it.\n\nHey, have a funny thought in the shower? Jot that down. Maybe you can stretch that one thought out for 30, 40 seconds. If you're really talented, a minute. You'll need at least a dozen of those thoughts to pad out an 8 minute set for open-mic, and trust me, to make a name for yourself you need some new stuff each time you get up there. Ready to open for someone? Those sets are usually 23 or 34 minutes. You do the math, because math is hard. Short of it is, at some point every SUC hears something, makes them laugh, fits in with their style, and they use it. It's more of the norm than you think. Especially since most watch a lot of other comics, then has a funny thought later and can't remember if it was original or not. That happens too. And honestly, it takes a lot more work to fit someone else's joke into your set. They have different timing, style and personality. It's when you start headlining that almost all your material is original, and that's probably still riddled with borrowed ideas that you tweaked, rewrote, rewrote again, tested, rewrote, reworked to fit in somewhere else, tested. rewrote, lather, rinse, repeat.\n\nNow it's different when all you use only \"borrowed\" material. We all knew SUCs like that, ones that if we saw them in the audience we would not use our \"A\" material. There are comics out there that only know how to regurgitate. Those people suck. Especially the ones that become super-famous doing it. We all know who they are, but luckily they're rare.\n\nThere is one comic that did get famous, is still performing, and I've heard him recently use one of my 15 year old jokes. And it always gets a laugh. I get a little jealous when I hear him use it, but a little proud too.\n\ntl;dr Jokes get borrowed, reworked and reused all the time. It happens. But if you're talented and can make it work in your set, more power to you.\n\nEDIT:Formatting",

This creature has the appearance of a giant humanoid ape. His body is covered in fur yet his features are strikingly human-like. He has a nose, two eyes, hands with thumbs, ears, oh--wait monkeys already have that. Never mind a giant monkey is in front of me. \n\n\"I am a monkey who loved humans so much I turned into a human. Now that girlfriend broke up with me I will destroy the world!\" The giant monkey whacks his chest like a gorilla. I guess he is a gorilla. \"Can you believe it! She called me a monkey! She said that she wants a human! After all what I did to her she wants a human! That's why I will destroy the world! And take REVENGE!!!!\"\n\n\"Oh I see.\"\n\n\"Prepare yourself HUMAN!!! Prepare to suffer the wrath of my heart-broken fist! I am the Man-Ape!\"\n\nThe primate leaps at me with his fist positioned to punch. \n\n\"Too slow.\" I easily dodge his fat knuckles. He tries to hit me by punching repeatedly. \"Too slow.\"\n\n\"You there MONKEY! Get your hands away from my master!\" The butt-chinned boy gets up after being slammed to the ground by the Man-Ape.\"Watch master as I beat this ape into a pulp!\" \n\n\"Hahahahaha!!! You think that your puny little fist can match my majestic knuckles? Fool I will bury you right hear and now!\"\n\nThe butt-chinned boy runs at Man-Ape and kicks him in his stomach. The monkey tries to pound him to the ground, this time the butt-chinned boy dodges his attack and jumps up and kicks him in his cheek. Th butt-chinned boy leaps up at him and punches Man-Ape in the cheek. Man-Ape uppercuts the butt-chinned boy in his stomach. Drool is basted from his lips as pain shoots up through his abdomen.  Before he plummets to the ground once more the butt-chinned boy grits his teeth together and screams.\n\n\n\"MASTER! I will show you my new secret technique!\" He lifts his chin in the air and \"Chin-butts\" Man-Ape in the bridge of his nose. \"Super-secret technique: Ultimate flaming phoenix chin-butt!!!!\"\n\n\"AAAAARRGGHHH!!!!\" Man-Ape falls to the ground in pain. Both of them are in pain. \"That actually hurt! But in the end I win!\"\n\nThe butt-chinned boy is unconscious from the impact of his \"ultimate technique\". I don't really know why I saved him but I guess I felt bad for him.\n\nI grabbed Man-Ape's fist just as he was about to pummel the butt-chinned boy into oblivion.\n\n\"Are you done with this?\"\n\n\"No! I will bury you next!\"\n\n\"Oh I see.\"\n\nI punch Man-Ape in his stomach and he immediately goes flying back into a concrete wall.\n\n\"How...can this...I lost?\"\n\n\"No...I just didn't lose.\"\n\nAfter a while both Man-Ape and butt-chinned boy stand up.\n\n\"I am sorry for the damage I did. What is your name?'\n\n\"I am Can't-Lose Man.\"\n\n\"Can you please accept me as your student! I still have much to learn in the ways of being human. Please!\"\n\nOh come on!

To his surprise, a rich man in a Ferrari pulled up next to him to pump gas into his $600,000 car. As the rich man was pumping gas he looked over at the bewildered redneck. Noticing the admiration on his face the rich man asked, in a cocky tone, \"what, you wanna race farm boy?\" Not one to back down to a challenge the redneck replied in a defiant tone \"I sure do city boy!\"\n\nShortly after that, the two men had there cars lined up on a super long stretch of straight road. The two men were standing in between the two cars discussing how to insure a fair start.\n\nThey finally concluded that the rich man would hold up 3 fingers and do a count down. When the last finger dropped they would go for it. So the rich man opened his door and stepped into his car, then the redneck walked around to the door of his car and climbed in.\n\nThe rich man started the count down and when the last finger fell they took off.\n\nThe rich man decided to toy with the redneck and only shift up to second gear, but by the time he got to full speed in second gear the pinto was just a dot in his rear view mirror. \"What a waste of time.\" the rich man thought.\n\nsuddenly, RRRRROOOOOOMMMMMM!!! The pinto went roaring by.\n\n\"Whoa!\" the rich man said. So then he shifted up into 3rd then 4th gear to still give the redneck a sporting chance. Once again the pinto became a dot in his rear view mirror.\n\nRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMM!!!!!! To the rich man's surprise the pinto went flying by again!\n\n\"FINE!\" The rich man shouted. So then he went all out, shifting up into 6th gear and putting the pedal to the floor. By now the Ferrari was doing about 210 Mph. The Ferrari blew by the pinto and once again the pinto became a tiny speck in his rear view.\n\nRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMM!!!!!! The pinto blew by him again, practically blowing the Ferrari's doors off.\n\nHaving been beaten by the pinto the rich man pulled over to the side of the road and stopped. In a rage he got out and slammed his door as the redneck backed up next to his car.\n\n\"WHAT KIND OF MOTOR DO YOU HAVE IN THAT PINTO!\" Shouted the rich man.\n\nThe redneck climbed out of his Pinto shaking like a nervous Chihuahua and replied, \"I have no idea, BUT I GOT MY SUSPENDERS CAUGHT IN YOUR DOOR!!\"\n\nNOTE: I injured my hand last week so I couldn't type it all out, instead I just copied / pasted it from ebaumsworld, *but* it is a joke my dad used to tell me, so I wanted to share.",

Jerry explains, \"The female there is lonely.  With no other gorillas to keep her company, she sits around depressed and doesn't do anything.  Nobody wants to watch a gorilla sit around.\"\n\nThe owner of the zoo makes several calls but can't find a male gorilla that anyone will loan to the zoo, so he comes up with a plan.  He goes to back to Jerry and says, \"Look, I've got an idea.  I've got a gorilla suit.  Now all you would need to do is wear it in the cage for a few hours every day and just kind of...  monkey around.  So she doesn't feel so lonely, you know?  You'll get your regular pay, plus $500 a week.  Whaddya say?\"\n\nJerry agrees, and the following day, he gets into the cage wearing his gorilla suit and starts milling around, doing what he would expect a gorilla to do.  Before long, the real gorilla takes notice, gets up, and starts moving around, too.  Visitors start to respond immediately, and a crowd starts to grow.  Word gets out, and within a couple of weeks, business is booming again.  That's how it goes for awhile, until one day, slowly, the people start to get bored with the gorilla exhibit again, and the crowds taper off.\n\nThe owner goes to Jerry again, \"Jerry, I need you to spice things up.  It's the same old boring stuff every day.  You gotta get people's attention!  Get the gorilla excited!  Have fun in there!\"  So Jerry gets back in the cage and starts swinging around on the monkey bars, rolling tires, and generally being more active.  The gorilla follows suit, and business picks back up.\n\nJerry starts to notice people becoming less interested, and he knows what needs to be done.  He starts going wild, running, jumping, throwing things, beating his chest, swinging around like a maniac...  but the gorilla suit is a little cumbersome, and he ends up slipping, mid-swing.  He flies over the wall and lands right in the middle of the next enclosure over:  the lion enclosure.  The crowd erupts into chaos.  Everyone runs to the lion enclosure to see if \"the gorilla\" is okay.\n\nThe fall knocked the wind out of Jerry, and it took him a few minutes to regain his bearings.  After a long moment, he started to stand up, only to see a large lion, slowly walking straight toward him.  He was frozen with fear.  The crowd looked on as the lion stalked closer and closer.  Jerry started to scream, \"Help!  H--\" when the lion pounced, knocking Jerry flat on the ground.  Jerry was terrified beyond belief.  The lion hit Jerry across the face with its massive paw, and just as he was sure this was the end, he heard the lion say, \"*Shut the fuck up, Jerry!  You're gonna get us both fired!!*\"\n\n:)\n\n\n**The zoo has a problem with their gorilla... (II)**\n\nThey aren't drawing the crowds they used to, and it's hurting their revenue in a big way.  The owner of the zoo goes to Jerry, the gorilla keeper, to see what can be done.  Jerry explains, \"The female there has gone into heat, and with no males to mate with, she sits around depressed and doesn't do anything.  Nobody wants to watch a gorilla sit around.\"\n\nThe owner of the zoo makes several calls but can't find a male gorilla that anyone will loan to the zoo, so he comes up with a plan.  He goes to back to Jerry and says, \"Look, I've got an idea.  Now...  *feel free to say no here.*  NO PRESSURE.  But...  well... for $500, do you think you could you fuck the gorilla?  Just one time?  She should be back to normal after that, right?\"\n\nJerry says, \"I don't know about that, I mean...  Well, $500 is a lot of money...  and...  I mean...  I just don't know.  I'll have to think about it.\"  The owner of the zoo tells Jerry to sleep on it and give him an answer the following day at closing time, and he agrees.\n\nThe following day, Jerry is sweeping up as the last of the guests are leaving when he hears the zoo owner's voice behind him, \"Did you think about my offer?\"  Jerry stops sweeping for a moment, turns around, sighs deeply and says, \"Yeah, I did.  I thought long and hard about it, and I need to talk to you.\"  The zoo owner says, \"Well, what do we need to talk about?\"  Jerry continues, \"I'll do it.  But I've got 2 conditions.\"\n\nThe zoo owner says, \"Well, that's reasonable enough so far.  What are they?\"  Jerry says, \"Well, the first one--and this is not negotiable--is...  well...   I'm *not* kissin her.  No way.  Just straight sex, nothing else.\"  The zookeeper, somewhat relieved and stifling a laugh, reassures Jerry, \"Of course, that'll be fine.  I don't think they really go for that sort of thing anyway.  Just the old in-and-out.  So what's the second condition?\"\n\nHesitant, Jerry hangs his head for a moment.  He shakes his head a few times, then looks the zoo owner in the eyes and says, \"Well, I hope this isn't a deal-breaker, but...  well...  it's gonna take me a few days to come up with the five hundred bucks...\"\n\n:)",

Once upstairs he urges his fellow drinker to try it.\n2nd Man: \"Well what the hell, it works, I'll try it.\" he jumps over the balcony, plunges downward, passes the 11th, 10th, 9th, 8th floors... and hits the sidewalk with a 'splat.'\n\nBack upstairs the Bartender turns to the other drinker: \"You\nknow, Superman, you're a real asshole when you're drunk.\n\n(2)A drunk was walking down the beach when he came across a genie lamp.

First furious, then utterly depressed, the drunk walked aimlessly for miles down the beach followed by an endless procession of ducks.\nFinally, in the distance, he saw the bright neon lights of an ocean-side bar. \n\"Now, that's what I need!\" he thought to himself. And, doing what came naturally, he went inside to drown his sorrows. As he sat down at the bar another gentleman, noticing the ducks, said \"Hey pal, what gives?\"\n\"Oh this stupid genie is hard of hearing! I actually asked for a million BUCKS!\" \"I see\", said the second man. \"You know, I once found a genie lamp too!\"\n\"Really?\" said the drunk. \"What did you get?\"\nThe second man pulled a small piano out of his pocket, then a miniature stool. Finally he took a one-foot-tall man out of his pocket who sat down and started playing bar songs.\n\"That's something else! But why did you ask for that?\" inquired the drunk. \n\"Come on...\" responded the second man, \"You don't REALLY think I asked for a 12-inch pianist do you?\"\n\n(3) A drunk goes in a bar and asks for a shot of Jim Beam. The bartender pours it and the drunk pushes it aside and asks for another shot of Jim Beam. The bartender pours it and the drunk drinks it. The bartender says, \"I watched what you did and I don't understand why you pushed the first one away and drank the second one!\" The drunk stated,\" I've been going to those AA Meetings, and they said WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T TAKE THAT FIRST DRINK!!!\".\n\n(4)A drunken guy was driving down a one way street the wrong way, a cop stopped him and asked \"didn't you see the arrows?\" The drunk driver replied \"Arrows, Hell I didn't even see the Indians.\"\n\n(5)Staking out a notoriously rowdy bar for possible drunk drivers, a cop watched from his squad car as a fellow stumbled out the door, tripped on the kerb and tried 45 cars before opening the door to his own and falling asleep on the front seat. One by one, the drivers of the other cars drove off. Finally, the sleeper woke up, started his car and began to leave. The cop pulled him over and administered a Breathalyzer test. When the results showed a 0.0 blood-alcohol level, the puzzled policeman asked him how that was possible.\"Easy,\" was the reply. \"Tonight was my turn to be the decoy\".\n\n(6)Three guys come into work Monday morning, each bragging about how drunk they were over the weekend. The first says, \"I was so drunk Saturday I was blowing chunks all night.\" The second says, \"That's nothing. I was so drunk that I blacked out, tried to drive home, and wound up spending Sunday in jail.\" The third then says \"Big deal. I got so drunk this weekend that I picked up a hooker, brought her home, and was banging her on the kitchen counter when my wife walked in on us.\" The first guy then interupts and says, \"But you dont understand... Chunks is my dog.\"\n\n(7)A drunk was walking along the beach when he saw a bottle. He stopped and rubbed it and a genie popped out.\n\"You have 3 wishes\" said the genie.\nThe alcholic said, \"I'll take a bottle that is never empty.\" Whamo he has a bottle that is never empty and starts to drink. The genie taps him on the shoulder and says, \"and what are your other two wishes?\" \"Oh,\" says the alcoholic, \"I'll have two more like this one.\"\n\n(8)One day in Dodge City, a cowboy rides into town. He pulls up outside the saloon, gets off of his horse, and ties him up to the hitchin post. He then walks around back of it, lifts the tail and kisses the horses backside with puckered lips. He then walks into the saloon. Across the street an oldtimer can't believe what he has just seen, so he rushes across the street and bursts into the saloon where he sees the cowboy drinking at the bar. \"Hey mister\" he says, \"did you just kiss your hoss' ass?\" \"Yup\" says the cowboy. The oldtimer says, \"if you don't mind me askin, why'd you do that? \"Cuz I got chapped lips,\" says the cowboy \"And kissin your hoss' ass cures chapped lips?\" \"Nope\" says the cowboy, \"but it sure keeps me from licking them.\"\n\n(9)Two rednecks, Bubba and Gator, were driving down the road drinking a couple of bottles of bud. The passenger, Bubba,said. \"Lookey thar up ahead, Gator, it's a po-lice roadblock! We're gonna get busted fer drinkin these here beers!! \"Don't worry Bubba\" Gator said. \"We'll just pull over and finish drinkin these beers, peel off the label and stick it on our foreheads, and throw the bottles under the seat\". \"What fer?\" Asked Bubba. \"Just let me do the talkin okay?\" Said Gator. Well, they finished their beers,threw the empty bottles under the seat, and each put a label on their forehead. When they reached the roadblock, the sherriff said, \"You boys been drinkin?\". \"No sir\" Gator said. \"We're on the patch.\"\n\n(10)If you're not supposed to drink and drive, why do bars have parking lots?\n\n(11)A bloke goes into a pub, takes a seat at the bar, and orders five pints. The barman gives him an odd look since the bloke's all by himself, but he serves up the five pints and lines them up on the bar. The bloke downs them....One, Two, Three, Four, Five. He finishes the last one and calls to the barman, \"Four pints, please, mate!\" The barman serves up four pints and lines them on the bar. The bloke downs them....One, Two, Three, Four. Then he belches loudly, sways slightly on the stool, and orders three more pints. And one after the other, he knocks them back.... One, Two, Three. \"Two pintsh, mate!\" he calls, and the barman places two pints in front of him. Down they go.... One, Two. As the bloke slams the last one down on the bar, he says, \"One pint, mate.\" So the barman fills the glass. The bloke sits there, staring at it for for a moment, trying to focus. Then he looks at the barman and says, \"Y'know, it'sh a funny t'ing, but the less I drink, the drunker I get...\"\n\n(12)A drunk gets up from the bar and heads for the restroom. A few minutes later, a loud, blood curdling scream is heard. A few minutes after that, another loud scream reverberates through the bar. The bartender goes to investigate.\n\n\"What's all the screaming about in there? You're scaring my customers!\"\n\n\"I'm just sitting here on the toilet and every time I try to flush, something comes up and sqeezes the hell out of my balls,\" replies the drunk.\n\nWith that, the bartender opens the door, looks in and says, \"You idiot! You're sitting on the mop wringer bucket!\"\n\n(13)Two drunks were walking along a railroad track. One says, \"All these stairs are killing me.\" The other says, \"It's not the stairs that kill me, it's these low railings.\"\n\n(14)A man walks into a bar and notices a 100-dollar bill in a frame above the bar.  He asks the barkeep, \"Was that the first hundred you made?\" \"No\", replied the bartender.  \"That's for a contest we have but no one's ever won.\" \"I want to play\", said the man. \"Well\", said the barkeep, \"There are three parts to this contest:  The first thing you have to do is knock out that bouncer over there.  Only one man has ever done that.  The second thing you have to do is go out back.  I have a pit-bull out there with a loose tooth.  You have to pull that tooth out.  The guy who knocked out my bouncer ended up in the hospital when he tried that one.  Finally, you have to make love to that 400-pound woman sitting at the back of the bar. \"Upon hearing the third requirement, the man said \"No thanks, I'll pass\".  However, after a good amount of drinking the man reconsidered and yelled to the barkeep \"Bring it on!  What's first?\" \"The bouncer\" said the bartender.  Upon hearing this, the man promptly walked over to the bouncer and laid him out with one punch. \"Impressive! Now for the pit-bull\", said the bartender. The man went out back.  For about five minutes all that could be heard was barking and crashing, and finally a dog's whimper.  The man walked back into the bar proudly and, zipping up his pants, said \"Now where's that fat bitch with the loose tooth?\"\n\n(15)This really drunk guy walks up to a parking meter and puts in a quarter. He stares at the needle that has stopped at 60 and exclaims, \"I can't believe I lost 100 pounds!\" \n\n(16)What's the difference between a bar and a g-spot?\nMost men have no trouble finding a bar. \n\n(17)Beauty is in the eye of the beer holder...\n\n(18)What would you call a drunk who works at an upholstery shop? A recovering alcoholic.  \n\n(19)Two friends were out drinking when suddenly one lurched backward off his barstool and lay motionless on the floor. \"One thing about Jim,\" his buddy said to the bartender, \"He knows when to stop.\" \n\n(20)There was a guy who had at least 4-5 drinks of whiskey every day of his adult life. When he died, they cremated him, and it took two days to put out the fire! \n\n(21)How do you know that a female bartender is pissed off with you? There's a string hanging out of your Bloody Mary. \n\n(22)Where does an Irish family go on vacation? \nA different bar. \n\n(23)What is the difference between an Irish wedding and an Irish Funeral? One less drunk.\n\n(24)How many Irish does it take to change a light bulb?\nTwenty One. One to hold the bulb and twenty to drink until the room spins. \n\n(25) A Poem: A beer was spilt on the barroom floor, \nAnd the bar was closed for the night...\nAnd out of his hole, crawled a little brown mouse, \nWho made a funny sight...\nHe lapped up that beer, on the barroom floor, \nAnd back on his haunches he sat...\nAnd all through the night you could hear him yell, \n\"Bring on the damn cat!\"  \n\n(26)After spending a happy evening drinking together, two acquaintances promise to meet again in ten years at the same bar, same time. \n\nTen years later, the first guy walks in, looks around, and sure enough, there is his friend on a bar stool. He clasps the old friend's hand and cries, \"The day we left, I didn't think I'd really see you here!\" \n\nThe friend looks up, stares, sways slightly and asks, \"Who left?\" \n\n(27)A man comes in to the room and says to his wife, \"I'm going to the pub. Get your coat on.\" \n\nThe wife, overjoyed that he has included her in his activity replies, \"Does that mean that you are taking me with you, darling?\" \n\nThe husband replies, \"No - I'm turning the heating off.\" \n\n(28)Sometimes when I reflect back on all the beer I drink I feel ashamed. Then I look into the glass and think about the workers in the brewery and all of their hopes and dreams. If I didn't drink this beer, they might be out of work and their dreams would be shattered. \n\nThen I say to myself, \"It is better that I drink this beer and let their dreams come true than be selfish and worry about my liver.\" \n\n(29)Two young Irish men were getting ready to go on a camping trip. The first one said, \"I'm taking along a gallon of whiskey just in case of rattlesnake bites. What are you taking?\" \n\nThe other one said, \"Two rattlesnakes!\"\n\n(30)A rather drunk man was walking along the street one day. He was staggering quite a bit and made two nuns that were approaching him, very nervous. The two nuns split apart and one walked to the man's left and one walked to the man's right. \n\nAfter the nuns were past the man, he turned around and said, \"Now how in the hell did she do that?\" \n\n(31)This small skinny dude walks up to the bar and starts to sit on a bar stool, and a big dude on the next stool says, \"That seat's taken!\" \n\nThe little dude sits down anyway. The big dude grabs him and whacks him several times with the back of his hand and tells the bartender, \"When he wakes up, tell him that was Judo from Japan.\" \n\nNext day the little dude returns, before the big dude gets a chance to hit him, he hits the big dude several times and the big dude falls to the floor. The little dude tells the bartender, \"Tell that sucker when he wakes up, that was a Monkey Wrench from Sears.\" \n\n(32)The car sped off the highway, went through the guardrail, rolled down a cliff, bounced off a tree and finally shuddered to a stop. A passing motorist, who had witnessed the entire accident, helped the miraculously unharmed driver out of the wreck. \n\n\"Good lord, mister,\" he gasped, \"Are you drunk?\" \n\n\"Of course,\" said the man, brushing the dirt from his suit. \"What the hell do you think I am ... a stunt driver?\" \n\n(33)A man walks into a bar and orders a beer and the bartender asks him to pay up. The guy says he has no money, but for the beer, he will sing through his asshole. The bartender is a little bit skeptical, but figures if the guy can do it, it's worth a beer. He agrees and the guy gets up on a stool, drop his pants, bends over, and then shits all over the bar. The bartender is pissed and screams, \"What the hell did you do that for?\" \n\nThe guy replies, \"Sorry, I was just clearing my throat.\" \n\n(34)Another rotten poem: Starkle, starkle, little twink,\nWho the hell are you I think.\nI'm not under what you call,\nThe alcofluence of incohol.\nI'm just a little slort of sheep,\nI'm not drunk like thinkle peep.\nI don't know who is me yet,\nBut the drunker I stand here the longer I get.\nSo just give me one more fink to drill my cup,\n'Cause I got all day sober to Sunday up. \n\n(35)A boy is watching television and hears the name Jesus Christ. Wondering who Jesus Christ is, he asks his mother. She tells him that she is busy, and to ask his father. His father is also busy so he asks his brother. His brother kicks him out of the room because he doesn't have time to answer his stupid questions, so he goes downtown and sees a bum in an alley. \n\nHe asks the bum, \"Who's Jesus Christ?\" \n\nThe bum replies, \"Well, I am.\" \n\nThe boy, not believing the bum, asks for proof. So the bum takes the boy into the bar down the street and takes him inside. They walk up to the bar and the bartender exclaims, \"Jesus Christ, are you in here again?\" \n\n(36)A completely inebriated man was stumbling down the street with one foot on the curb and one foot in the gutter. A cop pulled up and said, \"I've got to take you in, pal. You're obviously drunk.\" \n\nOur wasted friend asked, \"Ociffer, are ya absolutely sure I'm drunk?\" \n\n\"Yeah, buddy, I'm sure,\" said the copper. \"Let's go.\" \n\nBreathing a sigh of relief, the wino said, \"Thank goodness, I thought I was a cripple.\" \n\n(37)Two buddies were sharing drinks while discussing their wives. \"Does your wife ever...well, you know...does she...well, let you do it doggie style?\" asked one of the two. \n\n\"Well, not exactly,\" his friend replied, \"She's more into the trick dog aspect of it.\" \n\n\"Oh, I see. Kinky stuff, huh?\" \n\n\"Well, not exactly. Whenever I make a move, she's most likely to roll over and play dead.\" \n\n(38)A guy goes up to a girl in bar and asks, \"You want to play \"Magic\"?\" \n\nShe says, \"What's that?\" \n\nThe guy answers, \"We go to my house and screw, and then you disappear.\" \n\n(39)\n\nThere is man sitting in a bar who is really, really drunk. When the bar closes he gets up to go home. He stumbles and falls couple of times and finally manages to get out of the door. As he gathers himself, he sees a nun passing by. He stumbles over to her and starts punching her in the face. The nun is shocked beyond belief, but before she could say anything, he leans over and punches her again. \n\nThis time the nun hits the pavement. The drunk stumbles over to her, kicks her in the butt, picks her up and throws her against the wall. By now the nun is very weak and can barely move. He leans over her, grabbing her by the collar of her habit and says, \"Not feeling too STRONG tonight, ARE YOU, BATMAN!\"  \n\n(40)This guy goes into a bar and sees a man pounding shots of bourbon as fast as the bartender can pour them. He watches for a while then finally goes up to the drunk. \n\n\"What kind of a way is that to drink good bourbon?\" he asks. \n\n\"It's the only way I can drink it since my accident,\" the man replies, throwing down two more shots in fast order. \n\n\"What kind of accident was that?\" \n\nThe man guzzles another shot, shudders and then answers, \"I once knocked over a drink with my elbow.\" \n\n(41)An Irish guy walks into a bar. The bartender looks him up and down and says, \"Hey, you got a steering wheel on your pecker.\" \n\nThe man replies, \"Ay, it's driving me nuts!\" \n\n(42)\n\nA guy traveling through the prairies of the USA stopped at a small town and went to a bar. He stood at the end of the bar, ordered a drink, and lit up a cigar. As he sipped his drink, he stood there quietly blowing smoke rings. \n\nAfter he blew nine or ten smoke rings into the air, an angry American Indian stomped up to him and said, \"One more remark like that and I'll smash your face in!\"\n\n(43)A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo, much like the brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. The slowest buffalo are the sick and weak so they die off first, making it possible for the herd to move at a faster pace. \n\nLike the buffalo, the weak, slow brain cells are the ones that are killed off by excessive beer drinking and socializing, making the brain operate faster. \n\nThe moral of the story: Drink more beer, it will make you smarter. \n\n(44)Bill sat at The Local Bar, bragging about his athletic prowess. None of the regulars challenged him, but a visitor piped up, \"I'll bet you 50 bucks that I can push something in a wheelbarrow for one block and you can't wheel it back.\" \n\nBill looked over the skinny stranger and decided it wasn't much of a challenge. \"I'll\" take you on,\" he said. \n\nThe two men and a number of regulars borrowed a wheelbarrow and took it to the corner. \"Now let's see what you're made of,\" taunted Bill. \n\n\"Okay,\" said the challenger. \"Get in.\" \n\n(45)This guy enters a bar and orders two shots of vodka. He drinks the first and dumps the second on his right hand. He then orders a second round of shots, drinks the first and again dumps the second on his right hand. \n\nThe bartender sees this and becomes curious as the guy orders a third round and does the exact same thing. \n\nSo the bartender asks the guy, \"Hey man I hope you don't mind me asking but why the waste of good drinks?\" \n\nThe man say's, \"I have to get my date drunk!\" \n\n(46)While nursing a drink at a bar, a young woman was distressed to see a drunken, unkempt man sit down next to her. He says, \"Say, honey. . . I'd really like to get into those pants o' yours.\" \n\n\"Thanks,\" she shot back, \"but I've already got an asshole in there.\" \n\n(47)Sitting at the bar, glum Roger told the barkeeper that he was drinking to forget the heartbreak of his broken engagement. \"Yeah,\" said Roger, \"would you marry someone who didn't know the meaning of the word faithful, and who was flip and even vicious when the subject of fidelity came up?\" \n\n\"No way in hell,\" the bartender said. \n\n\"Well,\" said Roger, \"neither would my fianc\u00e9e.\" \n\n(48)A guy runs into a bar and says to the bartender, \"Give me twenty shots of your best scotch, quick!\" The bartender pours out the shots, and the guy drinks them as fast as he can. \n\nThe bartender says, \"Wow. I never saw anybody drink that fast.\" \n\nThe guy replies, \"Well, you'd drink that fast too if you had what I have.\" \n\nThe bartender says \"Oh my God! What is it? What do you have?\" The guy says, \"Fifty cents.\" \n\n(49) McNamara walked into a bar and ordered martini after martini, each time removing the olives and placing them in a jar. When the jar was filled with olives and all the drinks consumed, the Irishman started to leave. \n\n\"Excuse me,\" said a customer, who was puzzled over what McQuillan had done. \"What was that all about?\" \n\n\"Nothing,\" said the Irishman, \"My wife just sent me out for a jar of olives.\" \n\n(50)Having had one too many, a bar drinker was beginning to display an ugly side. An unescorted female sat down beside him and he whispered to her, \"Hey! How about it babe? You and me?\" \n\nAs she got up to move, he said loudly, \"Honey, you sure look like you could use the money, but I don't have an extra two dollars.\" \n\nShe looked back and replied just as loudly, \"What makes you think I charge by the inch?\" ",

        "body": "Researchers for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority recently found over 200 dead crows near greater Boston. Everyone involved was concerned that these crows might have died from Avian Flu, so they had a bird pathologist examine the remains of all the crows. To everyone's relief, it was determined that the problem was definitely not the Avian Flu. Instead, the cause of death looked to be from vehicular impacts.\n\nDuring the detailed analysis of the crows, it was noted that there were varying colors of paints found on the birds' beaks and claws. By analyzing the paint residue, it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by the impact of trucks, and only 2% were from impact with a car.\n\nThe Massachusetts Turnpike Authority then hired an ornithological behaviorist to look into the cause for the disproportionate percentages of crows killed by trucks versus crows killed by cars.\n\nThe ornithological behaviorist came up with the answer very quickly. The cause? When crows eat roadkill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn the other crows of impending danger.\n\nWhile all the lookout crows could say the word \"Cah,\" none of them could say \"Truck.\"\n",

After they breathlessly finished, John gets a big thumbs-up approval from his biker-buddies, the onlookers, and even the State Trooper, and then says, \"Wow! That was the best kiss I have ever had! That's a real talent you're wasting there, Sugar Shorts. You could be famous if you rode with me.

        "body": "It's been 4 years since that day. Now I am a 33 year old unemployed self proclaimed Can't-Lose Man. I have fought countless monsters and killed them all. In the beginning I used to have really fun battles with them until I won, but lately I have been squashing monsters and beating villains with as little as one punch. Why's that?\n\nI wanted to be a hero so I can save the world and have fun, not just punch and kill! Fighting now is sooooooooo boring!\n\nI want to meet Super-Duper Man maybe he can offer stimulus to my existence.\n\nWait...\nJust relax.\nMaybe all I need to do is clear my head and try something new.\n\nI have been fighting monster and monster and evil warlords for 4 years now. Maybe i need to fight someone who is different. Not a villain but a person who still has high levels of experience in the art of killing. I need to fight a martial artist.\n\nExactly where do I find that savage kung-fu killer is the real problem. I don't know any martial artists. I searched the streets over and over searching for that one person that can reignit my passion for fighting. But...I didn't find him.\n\n\"Sir...\nI try to stop a man as he walks down the street. He simply ignores me.\n\"Sir...\nI try again but he simply shrugs me off.\n\"Sir sir sir sir sir...\n\"WHAT!? WHAT DO YOU WANT!?\"\n\"Are you a martial artist?\"\n\"Are you mental? Do you have a drug problem.\n\"Uuugh no?\"\n\"Well get away from me.\"\nThe man leaves me as he continues walking down the street.\n\nI try to stop a woman this time. But before I can ask her she screams \"MOLESTER!!!!!\" and runs away from me.\n\nThis went on and on for sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long!\n\nFinally when I got tired of asking people a homeless old man approaches me.\n\n\"Boy I watched you all day. If you want to find a martial artist try looking in a Dojo.\"\n\n\"Dojo?\"\n\n\"Yes. One of the world's best Dojo's is \"Sensie Buttchan's academy for Butt-chin-Fu.\"\n\n\"Really!?\"\n\n\"Yes it's on 1234 Cheese Burger Street.\"\n\n\"THANK YOU OLD MAN!!!!\"\n\n\"No problem. I just hope that you find the person the rekindles your passion for killing.\"\n\nImmediately I ran as fast as I could to the Dojo. Surprisingly i was only 150 kilometers away.\n\nWhen I arrived to the Dojo I slammed open the door so hard the glass broke.\n\n\"Oh sorry.\"\n\nApparently there was a class going on at the moment. They all stop and look at me.\n\n\"I didn't mean to.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" A middle aged man  with a giant butt-chin appears from the crowd of martial artists.\n\nWOW!!! Look at all these people! And they ALL know how to fight! Wow this will surely reignite my passion!\n\n\"I am Can't-Lose Man! And i want to fight someone so strong that he will reignite my passion for fighting!\"\n\n\"Are you mental? Are you on drugs?\"\n\n\"Uuugh no.\"\n\n\"Well I would've told you to leave but you broke my door. And none breaks my door and gets away with it!\" The middle aged man leaps 15 meters into the air at me.\n\nTo tell you the truth he was too slow it was too easy to dodge. He he lands he immediately tries to throw a roundhouse kick at me. I dodge it again. I dodge every single one of his attacks as he tries to hit me.\n\nI duck hit lead hand punch and uppercut him in his giant butt-chin. I was expecting him to fall in the floor but to me surprise he doesn't budge.\n\n\"At this academy we perfect the art of Butt-Chin-Fu. A little hit like this means nothing to my butt-chin!\"\n\nHe punches me in my chin! WOW! Now this is fun! That actually hurt! Show me more! I want to feel more pain! Come on fight MEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!\n\nI throw one more punch at his butt-chin this time It's at 40%. His butt-chin turns into a regular chin from the impact as he couches up blood from his mouth. He was blasted into the ceiling of the club. He came back down unconscious.\n\nIs that it? It was so boring! Maybe he wasn't the leader.\n\n\"Come on who else wants to fight me!\"\n\nAll the other martial artists shriek like little girls as the all run away from me. Looks like I still didn't find that person. I walk out of the club sad.\n\nBefore I leave a teenage boy run after me.\n\n\"Wait!\"\n\"What do you want?\"\n\"I saw what you did to Sensie Buttchan! Please accept me as your disciple!\"\n\"Sorry kid I fly solo.\"\n\"Please!\"\n\"No.\"\n\"PLEASE!!!\"\n\"Go away.\"\n\nI walk away back to my apartment sad (like usual). But something in my mind keeps lingering. That night I had a dream that I will be this boy's teacher. Nah, it's just dream there's no way. \n",

The Orthodox would have assassinated this New Caesar too, but alas, for them, it was December, the month in which they were not allowed to kill any Caesers, so they sent an emissary to the Germanic tribes pleading that they would retire their request and simply give up pork anyway. \n\n\nThe Germanic Tribes replied, \"well, what are you going to give us for it?\" The Clerics retorted by sending a real to life Nativity scene, [which the Germanic tribes mistook as a hovel of immigrant refugees], a band of minstrels to play Christmas carols, and a holy hand grenade. The Germanic tribes replied by returning the super drunk minstrels singing only \"O Tanambaum!\" along with a huge pile of bundles wrapped in shiny colored wrappings, pine trees covered in candles, spiral cut ham soaked in glaze, kielbasa and enough of bacon for the whole senate while wishing them a happy holiday. \n\n\nThe clerics were confused of course, and asked them just where all of this crap was coming from, since it was clearly not in their holy books, to which the Germanic tribes replied, \"what book?\"  The Clerics said \"You know, Your T.O.s!\" to which the Germanic tribes replied \"there's a Technical Order for this Bull Crap??\" and upon being shown the book, replied \"Oh, we only read German, and sometimes that demotic American language the English named after themselves\" [To which the Scottish, the Welsh, and the Irish all retorted \"WE'RE NOT ENGLISH!\", but never mind them!] and then Caesar added \"heh, I read it, bits and parts, but it's all Greek to me.\" The Clerics were mostly confused and quite bemused, because at that point Everybody could read, write, sing, sleep and even eat Greek.   \n\n\nBut they decided they simply needed to try harder, and soon, they were at their wits end, because they couldn't figure out how to translate their holy book into something the German people might read [they tried three translations, of course, but the first was full of words so complicated that the Germans stared blankly back for hours, the second was so dry that it put the Germans to sleep, and the third got lost in translation altogether.\n\n\nThe Clerics, at their wits end trying to reconcile this matter of differences, went to the senate for help, to which Caesar retorted \"Then maybe we should consult an Oracle, or a Sage, or...Siri?\" The Clerics immediately said \"NO ORACLES!\" [but not because they violate the New Holy Book, not being of the Christian religion and all as one might expect their objection to be, but because the last time they consulted an Oracle, they ended up with a King who killed his father and married his mother and they really, really, REALLY wished to avoid that whole bloody Fucked up affair if they could. This left the Sages and Siri, but alas, it being winter, Sage was out of season, and they were about 2000 years too early to consult Siri. \n\n\nFinally, when all seemed lost, the clerics and the senators and Caesar alighted upon the fact that they were all the smartest people in the village, so that meant what they needed was the village idiot, someone so simple and autistically asbergerish as to see what they might have overlooked.  The village idiot wasn\u2019t too hard to find, luckily enough; they simply had to put a plate of glass in the village square and wait for someone to come along and try licking it, which happened way too quick and soon they had to take down the glass in fear that they might be overrun with idiot candidates or that the whole village might turn out to be idiots, which was very well possible because of all the lead in their diets due to the lead pipes that delivered the town drinking water.  \n\n\nThe head idiot, though, luckily enough was rather good at reading the word of the Good Book, and after speed reading it like a good Christian cherry picker on a holy book Sundae at an Atheist debate rally, he promptly closed the book and replied \u201cDoesn\u2019t apply.\u201d  \u201cHUH????\u201d said the entire crowd, to which he clarified: \u201cWell, you see here, this section here applies only if you\u2019re in Canaan, well, actually, just to the people in Canaan, and we\u2019re not in Canaan, now are we?\u201d  This made sense to all but one Cleric, who replied \u201cWhere the Fuck is Canaan?\u201d  To which the idiot pointed out that it was anywhere near where Jews use Salem might be, to say hello and goodbye and peace ahem, around Jerusalem.  \n\n\nThe entirety of Europe cheered when they found this out, and they promptly declared every week in January the Holy Bacon Fest to celebrate their great divine favor in being granted moral access to the heavenly gift of bacon, pork loin, keilbasa, ham, bratwurst, and pepperoni, which they all found went great on flatbread if accompanied with a little cheese; to expand their supplies, they went so far as to confiscate every bit of it from Canaan, telling the unwashed gentiles that they were just pig out of luck and they should have moved to Rome when they had a chance.  \n\n\nAnd all was well, except you may remember that Holy Hand Grenade.  Well, that was put in a closet for a great long while where it was forgotten for many, many, many years, and then one day when little Tommy Oppenheimer was packing everything to escape to America ahead of the Nazi Incursion, he just so happened to take it with him and the rest is history or heresy, be it told by a man or a woman...",

I'm dying to know.\n\nIf the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?\n\nThe monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles When you find these numbers,\n\nyou will become a monk.\n\nThe man sets about his task.\n\nSome years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.\n\nHe says,\n\nI have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for.

Her eyes are focused on a man walking across the street.*\n\nHe enters the pub. Rather sad looking he takes a seat at the counter and orders two double whiskies. As soon as they arrive, he pours them down and orders the next. \n\n*If the cat outside had the possibility and and the necessary desire to see what was happening inside the pub, she would have witnessed this scenario over and over again for quite some time. But she didn\u2019t.*\n\nMeanwhile in the bar, a woman approaches the man. She sits down next to him and starts talking. Her name is quite interesting and strange sounding, but irrelevant for the sake of this joke. \n\nThe two share a few words, compliments and shots and leave the bar. They go to his place and straight into the bedroom. Slowly the door closes behind them, leaving nothing in the hallway but the reflection of the moonlight on the floor, and some rhythmic noises coming through the door. \n___\n\nA few hours pass. \n___\n\n*Outside, the cat has come to a decision. After stretching herself just long enough, she jumps from the wall and ambles towards the big tree. She hears the water splashing from behind the tree, coming from a small river. And behind that river, she had seen another big tree. If her observations turn out to be correct, the branches of the two trees should at one point be close enough to go for the jump.*\n\nThe man slowly wakes up. He starts to remember that he brought a woman home last night and turns over to her side. Gasping. The sheer look of horror. Everything. Covered. In. Blood. *\u201cI must have killed her!\u201d* he thinks to himself. He rushes into the living room and looks into his safe where his pistol and bullets are stored. But everything is where it is supposed to be. *\u201cHow?\u201d* he asks himself, running into the kitchen to check on his Asian knife collection. But like in the safe, everything is there - clean and not bloody. \n\nHe tumbles towards the bathroom, where he sees himself in the mirror. Gasping. He is shocked. With the sudden realization dizziness comes over him. *\u201cDear Lord..\u201d*, he\u2019s stuttering, *\u201cI must have eaten her.\u201d*.\n\n*Outside, the cat has reached the furthest branch of the tree on her side. Standing here, ready to jump, the distance to the other tree suddenly appears farther. But she had come so far, why stop now. She takes a deep breath and jumps. Unfortunately she doesn\u2019t make it, so she falls down into the water.*\n\ntl;dr: Long foreplay, wet pussy. [8]\n",

The curious boy once again asked what this word meant, and the mother replied that it was the act of stuffing the turkey. Soon, the boy went upstairs to use the bathroom, and the father was there shaving his beard when he accidentally cut himself as well, so he naturally yelled out 'SHIT!' You can guess what the boy asked, and the father replied that it meant the shaving cream around his face.\n\nAn hour later, guests arrived outside and the kid went to answer the door.

No other children volunteer. Mr Trump searches the room. \"Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?\" Finally at the back of the room, little Johnny raises his hand.

He must have done this routine a million times, he started by asking \"you sir, are you a horse's head?\" \"no\" I replied. \"Are you a horse's mouth?\" \"No\" I said again. \"Well then, you must be a horse's ass\" the clown said.  I was destroyed, I had no reply, everyone laughed at me, it was the most humiliating moment of my life.\nI decided then and there I would get revenge on the clown in the worst way. I studied literature finding comebacks from modern writing, the texts of the great literary masters of the old days.  I went to clown college and learned their ways in an attempt to get in this clown's head.  \nFinally I spotted my chance: the circus was back in town.  I bought my tickets, I watched the sword swallowers, I watched the trapeze artists, the elephants, the lion tamers, and then the clowns appeared.  I saw that same clown with his big stupid grin, his floppy shoes, and that damn red nose.  He started in on that same old routine and I thought to myself \"I have him now\". \"You sir, are you a horse's head?\" the clown asked \"no sir, I am not\" I replied to that smug bastard.  \"Are you a horse's mouth?\" the clown continued, \"no, of course not\" I said in anticipation of the moment I had been waiting for. \"Then you must be a horse's ass\" the clown said, as the crowd burst into laughter. I tried to muster up a response but the crowd was far too loud and the moment had been lost.  \nI decided I must learn to command the attention of the crowd. I take debate courses.  I study the speech patterns and body language of the greatest speakers in history.  I master the art of the argument.  I even join a drama club to further improve my stage presence. \n\nFinally I see the day come when the circus comes to town.  Again I purchase a ticket, again I watch the sword swallowers, the elephants, the lion tamers, the trapeze artists, and last but not least the clowns. My nemesis appears after a line of 20 of his cohorts from a vehicle that is impossibly small.  We lock eyes and he shouts \"you sir! Are you a horse's head?\" confidently and steadily I reply \"no I am not\". He continues \"are you a horse's mouth?\" \"no\" I say again. \"Well then,\" the clown starts with the same old line \"you must be a horse's ass!\"  \"Hey\" I shout in retort knowing my moment has finally arrived \"fuck you clown\".

Suddenly his foot kicked something hard in the sand and he was immediately surrounded by smoke.  A Booming voice said :\n\n\"I AM THE GENIE OF THE LAMP\"\n\nThe man was dumbfounded.\n\n**Man:** WHAT?!  A Genie? Seriously? Like 3 wishes and everything?\n\n**Genie :** Yeah, you get three wishes but there are a couple of things you should know that got left out of all of the stories.\n\n**Man :** Like what?\n\n**Genie :** Well, you have to make all of your wishes before sunset and if you don't then what ever you wished for before sunset will cease to be.\n\n**Man:** That's it?\n\n**Genie:** No.. the union made us add a new one once divorces started up.  What ever you wish for, your ex-wife gets double.\n\n**Man:** That's odd.\n\n**Genie:** Yup, so Master.. what is your first wish? Wait, let me guess, money?\n\n**Man:** Uhh.. Yeah.. Um how about like a billion dollars?\n\n**Genie:** Ok but you understand that means that your ex-wife will get 2 billion dollars, right?\n\n**Man:** That's fine, maybe she'll get audited or something.  She left me and I don't care if she ends up with money.. I mean If I have a Billion dollars, what do I care what she has? \n\n**(The genie blinks his eyes, nods his head and says \"IT IS DONE\")**\n\n**Man:** It is done?!  I don't feel any different?  There isn't a pile of cash in front of me.. what do you mean IT IS DONE?\n\n**Genie:** Master. The money is in your bank account.\n\n**Man:** Yeah?\n\n**Genie:** Do you have a smart phone?\n\n**Man:** Yeah.\n\n**Genie:** Then go ahead and check your bank balance.\n\n**(The Man grabs his phone from his pocket and opens his banking app to check his balance)**\n\n**Man:** HOLY SHIT!\n\n**Genie:** Yup.\n\n**Man:** I'm a billionaire!\n\n**Genie:** I know.\n\n**Man:** You made me a billionaire!\n\n**Genie:** Nothing gets past you master.\n\n**Man:** Ok.. Ok.. Ok.. So I need to do 2 more, right?\n\n**Genie:** Yes master and you have less than an hour left.\n\n**Man:** Ok.. Umm.. ok.. so I'm a billionaire and I have to make 2 more wishes in an hour or I'm not a billionaire anymore.. But I don't want to just waste them.. Ok.\n\n**Genie:** Your wish?\n\n**Man:** I want ... I wish for.. a woman.. but not just any woman.  She has to love me unconditionally. She has to be gorgeous, and I mean like a solid 10.  She has to be my soulmate.. I mean we have to be perfect together as a couple, and she'll never want to leave.. and never cheat on me.. and. be .. ya know.. adventurous.. in bed.  Because I just got out of a marriage and there wasn't any...\n\n**Genie:** I get it, you want the perfect woman for you.. in every way.\n\n**Man:** Yeah.. and my same age.. and into the same things I'm in too..\n\n**Genie:** I got it.. But you understand that your ex-wife will have 2 perfect men come into her life.\n\n**Man:** I don't care, they can fight over her, I'm done with her.  Hell she'll probably just keep them both and not tell them about each other while she goes out and finds a third.\n\n**Genie:** Yes master.   I am going to look into your soul and bring forth your perfect mate.\n\n**(The genie grabs the mans head, looks deep into his eyes, there is a bright flash, and the genie  says \"IT IS DONE\")** \n\n**Man:** So, where is she?\n\n**(The Genie steps to the side to reveal a woman standing behind him)**\n\n**Woman:** Hey Babe!\n\n**Man:** Hey!\n\n**Woman:** I didn't know you were gonna be here.  Listen I'm gonna go and wash the ocean off of me.  I'll be by your house at 8, okay?\n\n**Man:** Sounds Great!\n\n**Woman:** Okay, love you!\n\n**Man:** Love you too.\n\n**(Woman walks off down the beach)** \n\n**Man:** Genie..\n\n**Genie:** Yes Master?\n\n**Man:** You fucking rock!\n\n**Genie:** I know.\n\n**Man:** What's her name?\n\n**Genie:** Her name is Sara.  But Master you must make another wish and you have only 10 minutes left or you lose the billion dollars and Sara.\n\n**Man:** What should I wish for?\n\n**Genie:** That is up to you Master.\n\n**Man:** What about like in Aladdin?  Do you want me to wish you free?\n\n**Genie:** NO!  Being a Genie is awesome.  I don't want it to end.  Please do not wish for that.. 9 minutes Master.\n\n**Man:** Ok.. so last wish.. don't want to waste it.. I'm a billionaire, I have the perfect woman who loves me, what else do I need?\n\n**Genie:** Master this isn't about needs it is about wants.  What do you want that you do not care if your wife gets double??\n\n**Man:** I think I know..\n\n**Genie:** 2 minutes Master\n\n**(The Man closes his eyes)**\n\n**Man:** GENIE!

After all the shit i have done to help you and the store you turned upside down with your shitty management skills you want to tell me if i don\u2019t like it i should leave? Like everybody else right? You expect for me to slave away to your idiotic demands and when you can no longer manipulate me i leave under your command? Never!! I want you to take a look around you at store *** and look who's still there since you became a manager at Office depot... Lisa, David and me! Where is everybody else John? You ran them off.. They didn\u2019t want to advance in life they didn\u2019t just find other jobs, They left because everybody hates your fucking guts in case you haven\u2019t noticed yet! managers, employees, customers, everybody hates you! you are rude, you are a compulsive LIAR and you just always got to have the last word and you got to have an answer for everything don\u2019t you? I have heard you lie to customers, coworkers and even yourself just to feed into your own arrogance! You are ridiculous! You have control issues dude and i am quiet sure you don\u2019t know that because you continue to tell yourself that you are doing the right things. You like to have people around that you can manipulate and lie to and guess what? I will not be one of those people! I have sat in that store and listened to your bullshit excuses and bullshit lies long enough and to be honest i hate hearing you talk because just a bunch of bullshit comes out of your mouth and you know it. You allowed William to come to store *** and completely fuck the Tech bench up! When i tried to tell you about it i was the judge and juror right? But have you done 1 thing in that store to solve any issues? No! All you do is eat, fart and point fingers and tell everybody else what to do! You have some nerve dude... I have bussed my ass for your liking and now when i refuse to continue to let you lead me in the wrong direction i should quit? No i will not quit and you will not make me! \nYou make terrible decisions! Stupid idiotic decisions and everybody in the store just wants to run and sit in corners and talk about it because they are in fear of saying something and losing their jobs. Well i guess i will be the one to speak for everyone then. The store is horrible, everybody is unhappy, you have forced all the good workers out the store with your shitty attitude and smart ass mouth! And God knows how many customers have not came back to the store because of your rudeness and bullshit. talking to you is like talking to a big turd that won\u2019t flush! You are not a manager, hell i don\u2019t know what the hell you are to be honest, being around people is not for you and i think that explains why you have dogs! The time you came to work with that black eye.... The excuse you gave us.. Bullshit, you got ya ass whooped for talking shit didn\u2019t you? Figured! To be honest i don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t say another word to me at that store. You can be mad, pissed or whatever else you want to be! You want to tell people that i am there because i need to be? Are you crazy? You have no idea why i work at that store do you? lol. Only if you were as smart as you want people to think you are sir... You are full of shit John and again i will not ever not say what i have to say.. YOU MAKE BAD DECISIONS! And none of the decisions you make hurts you it hurts everybody else that works there while you go climb up in your little red truck and drive away. When shit goes wrong you are never there, when computers come in when have you attempted to fix 1? For Christ Sakes you cant even make a dam copy in CPD without calling for help and you are the God Dam store manager! What is your purpose? The only thing you can do is force customers into buying instant ink and PPP's that they don\u2019t need. Open your god dam eyes and look around and see what\u2019s going on man. You have a bunch of fucking leaches in the store.. You have people in the store that are strictly just there to make money and go home! I was one of the few that was actually there to work and make my work area better. When i told you that what some people do were affecting the way i work and how i work what did you do? Told me i was bitching and gave me the stupid ass excuses that you usually do and nothing has changed in the past year, nothing! \nAs much as i had your back when shit happened, when people talked shit about you, when customers swore they were going to call corporate, when employees said they were going to kick your ass who stepped in and stopped them? Defused the situation? Me! And you want to come and act like i am just some part time punk? You have no idea what i am capable of John! I don\u2019t disrespect you and you will not! I, will not allow you to disrespect me under no circumstance! I'm going to say this again, take a look around man.. See what is really going on in your store that you so called manage! There is a lot more going on that you want to see! I have not become the person i am now for no reason. I am tired of the foolishness, I am sickened by your management. We are understaffed because of you! People don\u2019t come there because of you! You have no respect for customers that aren\u2019t spending $1000 in your store! I have witnessed you called valued customers liars to their face, i have witnessed you do some things that weren\u2019t professional, that management isn\u2019t suppose to do! I hear things, i see things, i know things that you wont think for me to know in a whole lifetime. \nThe tech department... Why is it in the condition it is in now? Because of your neglect and all the other managers neglect! Only time you guys come over there is when you want to see how many PCTU we do and i have been saying that for a year now. None of you care anything about the tech bench, all you care about it is the sales. We hardly have god dam computers to sell to customers but the first thing you want to know is if we sell a PPP or got a service! Are you out of your dam mind? You see the chain reaction of shit that has been happening with the tech bench? You know why that is happening? Because of me not giving a shit anymore! Remember how many services we use to get? How many happy customers we use to get? That stopped because of me! I came to you with problems and you gave me shit all the time. I am the best worker you have in that store no matter what you may think. You have only seen 1/4 of my work ethic! And i do mean 1/4 .. 1 day you told me i was \"the best you got\" and now i should quit? You want to be in control so bad and all those silly little people that quit because you wanted them to are just illiterate sheep! But i am not John! I am not, never been. You were an OK guy at one point then you took a turn for the worse. That\u2019s all i am going to say for now John, just know i am no one you have ever met before, you will not treat me like sheep, i will come to office depot and do what i have to do as my job description requires, if you feel like i cant do that then you fire me and we go from there but stop lying! We both know you are a liar and i said that to you today and you told me \"that\u2019s what you get paid for\u201d. Lead by example, If you get paid for lying then so do we and i will not lie for your well being or mine so i suggest you come up with something else. Fix your shit so everyone else can do their jobs! That\u2019s all i ask, make people do their jobs, you have an excuse for why everybody doesn\u2019t do what they are suppose to do. I work 2 days a week and i can get more things done than some people that work 40 hours and i only work 10 and when i ask you, you give me some stupid ass excuse! William and Shawn fucked up the tech Bench and i will not fix it until i get the respect i deserve without the lies and your bullshit! See ya Monday  \n",

One day the wife told him that his blasting habit could eventually result in him blowing his insides out. He laughed at her, letting go with another popper to accent his amusement.  Disgusted, she decided to make her point another way. While preparing a turkey to bake, she had an idea. She saved the guts from the turkey and set them outside for a couple days to ripen. The she got up early one morning, and warmed the ripe guts to body temperature. She took them to the bedroom where John was still sleeping and dumped them right beside his ass. \n\nJohn came out a bit later, white as a sheet. He was walking carefully and keeping his cheeks pinched tightly. He carefully sat down and said, \"Nellie, you were right and I should have listened to you! I cut a big one this morning, and my guts blew right out my ass!  He was scared and on the verge of tears. Nellie said \"I warned you! What are you going to do now?\" John said \"well- I'm just hoping it will be all right. With the grace of god and a curtain rod, I got them all back in\".",

He then went into a very long description of a supposed psychologist who studied the training of dolphins and it went something like this:\n\n\n\n\nA psychology student, finishing his doctorate, went to study the psychology of animals and spent some time at sea world studying Dolphins. He tried his best to train the Dolphins using positive reinforcement through treats of sardines and fresh fish. However, he was unable to find consistent results. Determined to find a pattern he stayed overnight for a week and observed the Dolphins, attempting to train them each morning. \n\nOn the fourth night he saw a flock of seagulls land in the dolphin habitat with their babies. The Dolphins proceeded to leap out of the water, scaring the adult seagulls away. Unfortunately the baby seagulls were unable to fly away and the Dolphins then swam up and had sex with them. The next morning he conducted the same tests he had earlier in the week and found that the Dolphins were much more receptive to taking orders. \n\nThe student, determined to find a correlation in the happiness of Dolphins and susceptibility to training, snuck off to a beach front the next night. He found a flock of sleeping seagulls and promptly stole all of the baby seagulls he could find. He carried as many of them as he could in his arms back to the dolphin tank at Sea world. \n\nOn his way back he encounter a sleeping lion. He slowly stepped over the lion, in an effort to not wake it. Immediately after he thought he was in the clear a bright flashlight was shone into his eyes. \n\nA police officer had stopped him. The student asked, \"what am I under arrest for?\"\nThe office responded \"Youre under arrest for transporting underage gulls across sedate lions for unorthodox porpoises.\"\n\nI immediately face palmed but secretly loved the joke.

I have spent my entire life warning them about their ways, so I'd like to see them in their just reward. I would really get a kick out of that!\"\n\nSt. Peter motions him towards an elevator and tells him to push the H button.\nThe Evangelical steps into it, presses the button, and feels his stomach rise\nas the elevator begins a rapid dissent. \n\nFinally, after 5 long minutes the trip ends and the Evangelical steps through the doors. The first thing that hits his senses is the live band music emanating from a stage. Then the sights and sounds of thousands of souls, eating, laughing, dancing, singing, and having a good time wash over him.Everywhere, as far as the eye can see, are tables piled high with food, scantily clad ladies frolicking around the tables giggling, with laughing men clutching at them. \n\nAfter a few minutes, the visibly upset Evangelical retreats into the elevator\nand ascends back up to the PG level. (Pearly Gates, if you didn't get it.)\n\nAs the doors open he angrily steps out to see St Peter beckoning him towards a\ndoor past the gates labeled \"Dining Room.\" He enters it famished to find a dull white room without any furnishings. Only a bare bulb lights it. A moment later Jesus enters the room with a folding card table and three folding chairs which he sets up. A few minutes later St Peter enters carrying three paper plates with peanut butter & banana sammiches.\n\nThey all sit down in silence to eat. With each passing minute the Evangelical\nis becoming more visibly agitated. Finally St Peter asks him what is wrong. The\nEvangelical says, \"Look, down there in hell they are having the party of the century with wine, women, and song. Up here we are eating this crap in a dull lifeless room. What the hell is going on?\"\n\nSt Peter looks at him in amazement, \"You don't really think we are going to go to all that trouble just for the three of us, do you????\"\n",

One for you, one for me.\"\n\nThe old man whispered, \"Boy, you've been tellin' me the truth. Let's see if we can see the Lord...?\" Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the Lord.\n\nAt last they heard, \"One for you, one for me. That's all. Now let's go get those nuts by the fence and we'll be done....\"\n\nThey say the old man had the lead for a good half-mile before the kid on the bike passed him..",

You drank yourself to death... You're in Heaven now.  Welcome my son.\"\n\nRalph was stunned. \"WAIT! I'm dead? No, I can't be! I've got too much to live for.  What about my wife?  My children? Please, send me back!\"\n\nSt. Peter said, \"I'm sorry.  Your time on Earth, as a man, has passed.  I can send you back, out of Heaven, but only as a dog, or a chicken.\"\n\nDevastated, Ralph thought for a while about his options. Then he remembered the chicken farm beside his home.  His eyes widened, as the thought of watching his kids from the nearby farm seemed like a good option for him.  He requested to be re-incarnated, as a chicken. \n\nThe next thing he knew, he was covered with feathers, clucking,\nand pecking the ground.\n\nA rooster strolled past. \"So, you're the new hen, huh? How's your first day here?\"\n\n\"Not bad,\" replied Ralph the hen, \"but I have this strange feeling\ninside. Like I'm gonna explode!\"\n\n\"You're ovulating,\" explained the rooster. \"Don't tell me you've never laid an egg before?\"\n\n\"Never,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"Well, just relax and let it happen,\" says the rooster. \n\nRalph did, and a few uncomfortable seconds later, out popped an egg!\n\nRalph was overcome with emotion as he experienced motherhood. He soon laid another egg -- his joy was overwhelming.  He began to cry as he was so thankful for this amazing opportunity to be able to give life.  \n\nAs the feeling returned, he swelled with pride, and he began to lay a third egg.\n\nHe heard someone yelling his name...

After he's done he sets the chicken down and it immediately makes it way for the small door. Just as it goes in it looks at him with extreme disgust. The man feels a lot of shame and quickly dresses and leaves.\nThe next day, he's feeling cheated and makes his way to the brothel to complain. He goes up to the Madam and says, 'hey, I know you did me a favor yesterday, but I didn't come here to be made to feel like a loser. I don't deserve the shame foisted upon me.' The Madam responds, 'OK, I hear ya. Lemme make it up to you. Go up the stairs again and this time take the door on the left.'\nHe does, and upon opening the door he sees several rows of theater-type seats facing a full-wall sized screen. Figuring there was going to be some porn, he finds an empty seat two over from a guy and sits down. After a few minutes he turns to the guy and says, 'so what kinda movie they gonna be showing?' \n'You never really know', the guy says.

And tell them that the first to die can go first.\n\nThe first guy walks up and tells St. Peter: I worked the same job and lived in the same 4oth floor apartment for the past 10 years, I would take lunch at 12pm every day and go home to eat with my wife, today I decided to surprise my wife and come home early for lunch, I walk in the door and she is standing there butt naked with a look of shock on her face. I knew in my heart that she was cheating on me, so I began going through the apartment, looking everywhere for this S.O.B she was sleeping with, as I was looking in the living room I heard someone screaming out on the patio, I open the door and there is a man hanging off the ledge, I was in such a rage I kicked his hands and watched him fall 39 floors to his death. I swear he was still moving so I dragged the refrigerator from the kitchen outside and pushed it over the patio\u2019s railing. It was such a strain on me I had a heart attack and died, and I still don\u2019t know if I killed him.\n\n\u201cokay\u201d said St. Peter \u201cgo stand over there, and let the next person who died come up\u201d\n\nThe second guy walks up and tells St. Peter:\nWell I just moved into my new 41st floor apartment and had today off so I thought I would do some unpacking, I was setting up my patio and not watching what I was doing and back into the railing and fell over, I was lucky enough to grab hold of the rails on the patio below and was screaming for help, when the guy came out, took one look at me and kicked my hands. I fell 39 floors and landed in trees and finally in some bushes. I knew I broke every bone in my body, but was very thankful for not dying. When out of nowhere this freaking refrigerator hits me. And I woke up here.\n\nNow St. Peter looks at the first guy and then at the second and tell him to stand far away from each other and not to talk. By now the third guy walks up and St. Peter tells him \u201c I don\u2019t think you have a chance of beating either one of the first two.\u201d And with that the third guy puts his arm around St. Peter and said \u201cpicture this\u2026.I\u2019m Naked in a refrigerator\u201d",

Within seconds a huge, hairy man lumbers out of the steam room toward him. \"Did you call for me?\" asks the hairy man. \"No, what do you mean?\" replies the old man.\n\n\"You must be new.\" answers the hairy man, \"It's\na rule that if you fart, it implies that you called\nfor me.\" The huge man easily spins him around,\nputs him over a bench and has his way with the\nold man.\n\nThe newcomer staggers back to the colony office\nwhere he is greeted by a smiling, naked\nreceptionist. \n\n'May I help you?' she asks.\n\n\"Here's my membership card. You can have the\nkey back and you can keep the $500 membership\nfee.\"\n\n\"But, Sir,\" she replies, dismayed, \"you've only been here a\nfew hours. You haven't even had a chance to see all\nour facilities.\"\n\n\"Listen lady, I'm 68 years old. I only get an erection\nonce a week, but I fart 15 times a day.\"",

Why Russia?  \n- Listen, it's awesome there. You walk into a store, you take whatever you want, and you don't have to pay. You walk down the street and someone annoys you by his looks? You are free to approach him, smack him in the face and no one even tries to hurt you back. You can go to a bar and get wasted as fuck without paying. Even if you see a nice lady on the street, you just take her with you, then you fuck her and everyone's cool about it.  \nSo the grandson buys a ticket to Moscow and he flies there.  \nHe walks into a store, gets some groceries and booze, and then leaves. Soon the security gets him and beats the shit out of him.  \n  \nSo he's walking down the street, feeling frustrated and angry, when he notices a young lad smoking a cigarette. He comes up to him and hits him in the back of his head to relieve some stress. The young lad then calls his friends and the grandson gets beaten once again.  \n  \nHopeless and all bruised, he wanders to a nearest bar. He drinks many shots, and after he gets totally wasted the waiter gives him a receipt. Shocked, he refuses to pay and he gets beaten and thrown out of the bar.  \n  \nHungry and miserable he thinks - \"Maybe at least I'll get laid here in Russia\". The grandson grabs a random girl in a park, drags her behind a tree and does his thing. Sadly, two cops were passing by, they noticed what's happening, they beat him up and arrested him.  \n  \nBeaten and angry he eventually makes it back home. Right after passing the doorstep he yells at his grandpa:  \n- You lied to me! You said it's so nice in Russia, yet I got beaten by security, after that I got beaten by some russian lads when I hit one of them, they threw me out of the bar and when I shagged a girl, I ended up in arrest.  \n  \nThe grandpa then asks:  \n- Who were you with?  \n- Well, I bought an all inclusive travel from some cheap travel agency.   \n- Oh, that's why. You know, back in the days only one travel agency covered all of those attractions.  \n- Which one?  \nThe grandpa looked at him, and with a tear falling down his cheek, he whispered:  \n- Wehrmacht...\n\n",

It's Sunday and the donut says to himself...\"You know what I think I'm going to take the day off and go enjoy myself.\"  The Donut hasn't taken time off in about 3 months so he decides that he's going to go spend the day down at the local pier.  \n\nSo he goes to the pier and starts rolling around or whatever donuts do.  He's at the pier for several hours before a man walks up to him and says \"Hey you know I've seen you rolling around here for a while, do you need help with something?\"  The donut replies to the man \"It's my birthday today and I'm not sure what I want to do.\"  The man laughs and says to the donut \"you know I heard there's a cruise ship pulling out of here in a couple hours...if you make it down to the travel agency I'm sure you can grab a ticket and have yourself a few days to relax!\"  The donut replies \"you know what?  That's a great idea, I think I'll do just that...yeah I could use a few days off from work.\"  The donut quickly runs back home packs his bags and gets a ticket from the travel agency and boards the cruise ship ecstatic for his journey.\n\n\"Wow, this is amazing!\" the donut says.  The donut's having a great time on the cruise, he's rolling around the decks, tanning in the sun, sprinkles blowing in the wind...whatever it is donuts do to have fun.  So the donut gets this great idea all of a sudden...\"gee it's my birthday today, I think I'll ask the captain if he'll let me drive the ship...after all it is my birthday! That's not a bad idea, why not?!\"  \n\nSo the donut goes up to the bridge and says \"Captain Captain it's my birthday today can you please let me drive the ship.\"  The Captain says \"No get the fuck out of here!\" and he kicks the donut out.  \n\nThe donut looks confused and goes back to his cabin for a bit...then he says to himself \"you know what?  I bet the Captain was just really busy when I went up there, I'll just go up there and ask him again.  He definitely won't turn me down this time!\"  So the donut goes back up to the bridge again and says to the Captain \"Captain Captain can you please let me drive the boat, it's my birthday today I'd love to drive the boat!\"  The Captain says \"No, get the fuck out of here, if you come up here again I'll have you thrown overboard!\"  \n\nAgain, the donut looks disappointed and returns to his cabin and takes a nap for a few hours.  He wakes up and says to himself \"You know, the Captain must have been really busy earlier!  If I go back up there now and ask to drive the boat there's no way he'll turn me down!  He just can't!\"  The donut rolls off eager as always and makes his way to the bridge.  He rolls into the bridge and says \"Captain Captain will you please let me drive the boat?\"  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\nWhat do you think happens next?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n*The Captain threw the Donut overboard.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nSo a man decides he's going to propose to his girlfriend, he's absolutely in love with this girl so he's got the perfect proposal planned.  He takes her out to this bluff overlooking the ocean.  It's a beautiful sunny day.  The man set up a picnic and the two are jamming out to music on his iphone...everything is going perfect.  \n\nSo he finally feels like it's time to propose...he bought her the most expensive beautiful ring that he hand picked at the jewelry store.  He spent his entire life savings on this ring.  He reaches out into his back pocket and as he goes to get down on one knee to propose he slips and drops the ring over the bluff into the water...gone forever.  His whole life savings wasted away.  His girlfriend looks at him and says \"You know what, I love you and I want to marry you anyway.  I know it'll be hard but we can make it work!\"  \n\nSo a couple weeks pass by and the couple have been having to work long hours to pay their bills.  They decide that they should go out for a nice expensive date to relax from all the extra work they've been doing to make up for the ring he bought.  The man takes his fiance out to a nice expensive seafood restauraunt and he orders himself a nice lobster and she orders a plate of hot steamy oysters.  Just as his fiance opens the first oyster she screams and drops it on the table.  The mans eyes are wide open in shock at what's inside...\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n**IT'S THE DONUT!!!!!!!!!!!!**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is a great joke to tell your friends.  It's especially great if you want to get someone in particular since this joke can be told in two parts, the donut part and the proposal part.  I've even spanned this joke out over several days...or just as little as ten minutes.  But when you finish telling the joke to whoever they usually say \"the ring\" and look like and idiot when you tell them the real answer.  The longer you let this joke ride the better the laugh, since your friends are usually pissed off after the donut gets thrown in the water.\n\n",

As he runs to the nearest restrooms, and he finds the men's room is in use and he can't wait any longer. Reluctantly, he finds the women's restroom to be available and runs in.\n\nIn the women's room, the man is shocked to see a panel of buttons on the toilet stall wall. Overcome by curiosity, the man inspects the buttons closer. The first is labeled \"CW\"... seeing no harm, he presses it and much to his delight he is sprayed with cold water, and so he understands why it's labeled CW. It feels nice, so he makes his way down to the next button.\n\nThe next button reads \"WW\". Hoping for the best, he presses the button and his ass is greeted with warm water; ahh yes, WW, warm water. This feels even nicer and he's delighted to move down the list.\n\nThe next button is labeled \"WA\", which he excitedly presses and is dried off with some warm air. He's elated by this fancy toilet and takes a moment to enjoy this experience before pressing the final button.\n\nThe last button, labeled \"ATR\" beckons him to press it. Each previous button was an increasingly nice experience, so he's expecting ATR to be even better. Giddy with joy, he smiles and presses the ATR button. Suddenly, the man feels immense pain and then passes out.\n\nThe man wakes up a few hours later in a hospital, confused and very numb from the pain meds. He finds a nurse and begs to know what happened. The nurse explains, \"you were found passed out in the women's restroom.\" The man explains how the men's room was in use so he had to use the women's.\n\nThe nurse asks him, \"while in the women's restroom, you pressed the ATR button, didn't you?\" The man nods while displaying a look of confusion. The nurse looks back at him and says, \"ATR stands for automatic tampon remover. Your penis in under your pillow.\"",

He goes to Doggy Heaven and is greeted by Saint Peter at the Pearly Gates. Peter welcomes the dog to Heaven and gives him a quick overview of the place.

Cut the boy in half, and you each take half home with you.\"\n\nAt this, the first mother says \"Yes, cut him in half!\", but the second mother refuses - \"Don't hurt him!\".

He went to the bank and withdraw all his money to buy 100 sheeps. He went back home and suddenly he realized that he forgot to buy a ram in order to make his sheeps pregnant, but he also realized that he has got no more money to buy one. So he picks up the phone and phoned to the vet in order to find a solution. The vet says: \"alright no problem, you have to do an artificial insemination and everything will be alright\", the guy had no clue about what artificial insemination was, so he decided to don't look stupid and said:\"yes yes no problem, but how can I understand if this artificial insemination worked fine?\" the vet replies back \"Well the day after the insemination open up the windows and look for the sheeps, if the sheeps are laying on the ground without moving too much it means that the process has worked fine, otherwise you have to repeat the operation again\". So the guy, who was not an expert and a bit ignorant, decided that the best way to make this operation was to fuck all the sheeps by himself. So he picked up his big van, load all the sheeps in it and take them to the forest were he fucked all the sheeps once, he went back at night and went to bed for a good sleep. The morning after he shout to his wife: \"Maria! Open up the window and tell me were the sheeps are!\", Maria replies: \"well...they are standing...eating grass...playing around!\" they guys says:\"Damn! it didn't work!\"\nSo he picked up his van and loaded all the sheep again to take them to the wood were he fucked all the sheep twice, back to home very very tired and went to bed for a sleep...\nThey day after when he woke up he shout to his wife: \"Maria! open up the window and tell me how the sheeps are!\", Maria replies back:\"Well..the sheeps are standing...playing around and eating grass!\" So the guy pick up the van again, load all the sheeps up and he went to the wood were he spent all day long fucking sheeps all day long. He went back home veeery very tired, went to bed and fall in a deep sleep...the day after he woke up and and ask to his wife:\"Maria! Open the window and tell me how the sheeps are!\", Maria as usual open up the windows and say after a pause :\"well..there are no sheeps anymore.....ah no...hang on...they are all on the van and one of them is honking the horn!!\"",

Boldly, the Englishman asked his love's father for his daughter's hand in marriage. The father looked at the Englishman, his face twisted with scorn and said, \"**NON** My daughter shall marry only a proper Frenchman!\" As the Frenchwoman collapsed in her grief, the English man swore that he would not surrender so easily.\n\nThe next day, the Englishman went to his physician and made a mad request. \"Doctor\" he said, \"I find myself loving a woman as no man, since the beginning of CREATION! has loved another, and I am in dire need of your assistance. For you see I am maddened by my love of a fair French goddess!\" The doctor clutched chest as he let out a gasp and exclaimed, \"A Frenchwoman! Surely you are mad!\" The Englishman then shouted, \"MOCK LOVE NOT, PHYSICIAN! For you must know I intend to wed this fairest of maidens, but to my dismay, her father will not allow a blessed union to take place unless... I am a Frenchman! So my request to you, learned man of the medical arts, is for you to transform me... into a Frenchman!\" The physician sat somberly on his stool as he lit a pipe filled with the finest of tobaccos. Idly puffing on his tobacco, he lifted his eyes and said, \"I know of a procedure, however it comes with... considerable risk.\" The Englishman stood up and shouted, \"RISK IS OF NO CONCERN TO ME, FOR THIS IS LOVE WE SPEAK OF!\" the physician then put out his hand and said, \"Charles, steady on.\" The Englishman composed himself and listened intently to the physicians words. \"You see my dear sir, I can perform a surgery to mold you into the perfect Frenchman, however I must remove five percent... of your brain!\" Without a moments hesitation the Englishman agreed and he was wheeled into surgery.\n\nThe surgery was performed and the Englishman survived the cutting, snipping, and pulling. Some hours later the Englishman awoke from his narcotics induced stupor. Upon waking the physician rushed into the room and exclaimed, \"MY dear sir, there has been the most terrible of errors, for you see we did extract a mere five percent... we removed fifty percent!\" The English then looked at the physician, flashed a carefree smile and said, \"Crikey!

You say you made $300,000 last year from gambling alone?\"**\n\n>Grandpa: **\"Yes. I am very good at it. Would you like a demonstration? I will bet you $1,500 that I can bite my own eye.\"**\n\nThe IRS agent stares at him for a minute, quite confused, and takes the bet. Before he can retract his words, Grandpa pops out his glass eye and proceeds to bite it. The IRS agent is stunned, and just lost a grand.\n\n>Grandpa: **\"You didn't think I could do it did you? Tell you what, double or nothing, I can bite my other eye.\"**\n\nThe IRS agent studies Grandpa for a minute and thinks to himself that there is no way this guy has two glass eyes, and takes the bet. Grandpa pulls out his dentures and uses them to bite his other eye. The IRS agent's mount drops. He is out $3000 now fair and square, with this man's lawyer here as proof, and starting to get worried.\n\n>Grandpa (laughs): **\"You look worried, son. I will do one more bet, double or nothing. I am going to stand here and pee into that waste can behind you and not spill a single drop anywhere else.\"**\n\nThe IRS agent looks at the man, turns around and looks at the waste can. It is about 6 feet behind him. This old man will have to pee about 8-9 feet and not spill a single drop. The IRS agent is worried, but he thinks he can win this bet.\n\n>IRS Agent: **\"You're on!\"**\n\nGrandpa stands up and unzips. He struggles mightily and lets a weak stream go. It doesn't get anywhere near the trash can. In fact, it just splashes all over the IRS agents desk and runs onto the floor. The IRS agent starts jumping up and down with a huge smile on his face.\n\n>IRS Agent: **\"HAHA! YES! You didn't even get close!\"**\n\nThe lawyer puts his head in his hands at this point, shaking it slowly, clearly upset about the incident. The IRS agent looks over at him and asks what is wrong.\n\n>Lawyer: **\"Just before we came in here, Grandpa bet me $25,000 that he could piss on your desk today and you would be happy about it.\"**\n\n",

        "body": "Farmer John found himself in a bit of a rut. His crops weren't yelding like they use to, cattle prices had hit an all time low, and he was really strapped for cash. After discussing it with Mrs. Farmer John, they decided to salvage what they had, sell the farm, and move to greener pastures. He kissed his crying wife goodbye and saddled up his horse to make the trip into town.\n\nOn the way to the bank to begin drawing up the documents, he came upon his long time neighbor, Farmer Fred, with his two sons pushing overloaded wheelbarrows of eggs into town. There were so many eggs that they were toppling over themselves and breaking on the ground, forming a trail of yolky badder behind them. The family didn't seem to care how many dropped as they walk, and almost seemed to be in a daze upon looking at them.\n\nNow, farmer John was amazed by this; he had never seen so many eggs in one place in his entire life. He reigned in his horse and stopped Farmer Fred and his boys in their tracks.\n\n\"Hey there Farmer Fred. I have to ask - how in the world did you get so many eggs?!\"\n\n\"Well Farmer John,\" Farmer Fred replied, \"I went down to the market the other day and got me one of those new breeds of roosters they just made! They Call them Rooty Roosters and by gummit, this thing has made our hens lay eggs damn near nonstop for the last week! This load we've got here is our fifth haul today alone!\"\n\nFarmer John was shocked. he bid Farmer Fred and his boys a good day and hightailed it into town, pulled out a small loan from the bank, and bought himself a brand new Rooty Rooster, which he unceremoniously named Rooty. He cinched up his horse, rode all night back home, and explained to Mrs. Farmer John what had happened. She grab Rooty by his neck, hicked up her skirt and trudged out to the hen house. \n\n\"Now Rooty, you go get in there and earn your keep!\" Mrs. Farmer John shouted. She flung the coop door open, threw Rooty in, and slammed the door shut. She and Farmer John went back inside and went to sleep.\n\nThe next day, Farmer John leapt out of bed, ran to the hen house, and flung the door open. He couldn't believe his eyes! The hen house was damn near overflowing with fresh eggs! He ran back inside, got his wife, and they both jumped for joy. However, when they went to look for Rooty, he wasn't in the hen house - he was found trying to hump the pigs! Farmer John went over and grab Rooty.\n\n\"Rooty, Rooty, Rooty, you're gonna fuck yourself to death!\" Farmer John said, tossing Rooty back in the hen house and closing the door. They gathered all the eggs they could, went to the market, and sold each and every last one of them.\n\nThe next day, Farmer John ran right on back out to the hen house. He couldn't believe his eyes! The coop itself was chock full of eggs to the point the hens were wedged against the wire sides! He and Mr.s Farmer John jumped for joy but when they went to look for Rooty, he was nowhere near the hen house - they found him trying to hump the cows! After moving the hens into the barn, Farmer John went to collect Rooty. \n\n\"Rooty, Rooty, Rooty, you're gonna fuck yourself to death!\" Farmer John said as he thew Rooty into the barn with the hens. He and Mrs. Farmer John collected all the eggs they could, went to market and sold each and every last one of them. \n\nThe next day, Farmer John went out to the barn, which appeared to have crumbled overnight. Hens were mounted atop cartoonishly large piles of eggs, which were still popping out of them as he watched in horrific amazement. As usual, he looked for Rooty but was nowhere near the hens - they found him trying to hump the horses! They decided to avoid any further damage to their property and allowed the hens to walk freely around the farm.\n\n\"Rooty, Rooty, Rooty, you're gonna fuck yourself to death!\" Farmer John decried as he shoveled egg load after egg load into the back of his newly bought trailer. He and Mrs. Farmer John went to market, and sold each and every last egg they had. \n\nThe next day, Farmer John sprung out of bed but with dismay, not a single egg was found anywhere on the farm. The hens were all accounted for, but Rooty was nowhere to be seen. Farmer John went out to look for Rooty. He spent hours looking for him but had no luck. Right as he was about to turn back, he noticed several buzzards circling something out in the pasture. He walked out there to find Rooty's lifeless body laying in the grass.\n\n\"Rooty, Rooty, Rooty, I *TOLD* you that you'd fuck yourself to death!\" Farmer John said, wiping off his brow.\n\nTo which Rooty replied, \"Shh, they're about to land.\"",

        "body": "First of all, - just for some background: My Mum died right when I was born, (she was actually really, really hot- but this isn't about her. I guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.\n\nAnyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.\n\nI don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn't make it for me- but I thought she was so fucking beautiful that I watched it twice. I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. (My dad's family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it).\n\nSooo... I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home.\n\nMy friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to fuck her brains out. Looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly.\n\nAfter we left, we all went to crash with my Sister's friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging. Pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I'm not saying that I'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.\n\nMy friend and my sister never hooked up I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was fucked up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.\n\nSadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart... and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her.\n\nBut I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh.\n\nA little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can't say I was surprised. But even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone.\n\nIt was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him.\n",

When his personal hygiene and love life started to suffer, he sought medical help.\n\nAfter being referred from one specialist to another, he finally came across a doctor who solved the problem. \"The good news is I can cure your headaches; the bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press up against the base of your spine. The pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.\"\n\nJoe was shocked and depressed, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife. After the operation, his mind was clear, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. He walked past a men's clothing store and thought, \"That's what I need, a new suit.\"\n\nHe entered the shop and told the salesman, \"I'd like a new suit.\" The salesman eyed him briefly and said, \"Let's see, size 44 long?\" Joe laughed, \"That's right, how did you know?\". \"It's my job.\" replied the salesman. Joe tried on the suit, and it fit him perfectly. As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, \"How about a new shirt?\" Joe thought for a moment and then said, \"Sure!\". The salesman eyed Joe, then said, \"Let's see, 34 sleeve and 16 and a half neck.\". Joe was surprised, \"That's right, how did you know?\". \"It's my job.\" came the familiar reply. Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly, as well. The salesman asked, \"How about new shoes?\". Joe was on a roll and agreed. The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, \"Let's see, nine-and-a-half?\" Joe was astonished, \"That's right, how did you know?\". \"It's my job.\" said the salesman, again. Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly, again. He walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, \"How about some new underwear?\" Joe thought for a second and said, \"Sure, why not.\" The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, \"Let's see, size 36.\" Joe laughed smugly, \"No, I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old.\"\n\nThe shocked salesman shook his head, \"You can't possibly wear a size 34!

The situation looked hopeless to her -- how could she possibly continue to feed her family now?\n\nIn a depressed state of mind, she hung herself. When the husband awoke to find his wife dead, as well as the cow, he too began to see the hopelessness of the situation, and he shot himself in the head.\n\nNow the oldest son woke up to discover his parents dead (and the cow!), and he decided to go down to the river and drown himself.\n\nWhen he got to the river, he discovered a mermaid sitting on the bank. She said, \"I've seen all and know the reason for your despair. But if you will have sex with me five times in a row, I will restore your parents to you.\"\n\nThe son agreed to try, but after three times, he was simply unable to satisfy her again. So the mermaid drowned him in the river.\n\nNext the second oldest son woke up. After discovering what had happened, he too decided to throw himself into the river.\n\nThe mermaid said to him, \"If you will have sex with me ten times in a row, I will make everything right.\" And while the son tried his best (seven times!), it was not enough to satisfy the mermaid, so she drowned him in the river.\n\nThe youngest son woke up and saw his parents dead, the dead cow in the field, and his brothers gone. He decided that life was a hopeless prospect, and he went down to the river to throw himself in.\n\nAnd there he also met the mermaid. \"I have seen all that has happened, and I can make everything right if you will only have sex with me fifteen times in a row.\"\n\nThe young son replied, \"Is that all? Why not twenty times in a row?\"\n\nThe mermaid was somewhat taken aback by this request. Then he said, \"Hell, why not twenty-five times in a row?\" And even as she was reluctantly agreeing to his request, he said, \"Why not THIRTY times in a row?\"\n\nFinally, she said, \"Enough!! Okay, if you will have sex with me thirty times in a row, then I will bring everybody and the cow back to perfect health.\" \n\nJust before the young son starts, he hesitated and asked, \"Wait a minute!!

He said, \"The 1st is that never be DISGUSTED about anything in the body.\" For example, he inserted his FINGER in the dead body's ANUS & put the finger in his own mouth & TASTED it. Then he told the students to do what he did. The students hesitated for several minutes, but eventually everyone inserted their fingers in the body's ANUS & tasted it. When everyone finished tasting their fingers, they were all frowning. Then the professor looked at them & said: \"The more important 2nd quality is \"Observation\". I inserted my MIDDLE finger but tasted the 2nd finger...Now learn to pay attention!!! Most of the students fainted!! \n\nLesson learnt: Always learn to pay attention.",

The Underworld would not be able to sustain so many souls.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Daedalus replied. \"What would you want me to do about it?\"\n\n\"You are the great builder who designed the Labyrinth for King Minos himself, and I want you to do the same for me as well. But not just any Labyrinth. We need a Labyrinth that is economical and efficient. We need a Labyrinth that will suit our needs and adapt to any situation that may arise in the future. We need a Labyrinth that can think for itself.\"\n\nDaedalus pondered for a moment, then finally said \"I'll see what I can do.\"\n\nThe great architect spent 4 years planning and building his first prototype of his new Labyrinth. He showed the prototype, Labyrinth Beta, to Hades.\n\n\"This looks really good, Daedalus,\" Hades said. \"The design is economical and efficient. But, I want an intelligent Labyrinth. Now, you just need to add some form of Artificial Intelligence to it. We have a few new souls here, so maybe they could help you with that.\"\n\nSo Daedalus, along with a group of Computer Science students, programmed a complex AI for the Labyrinth in 3 months. They presented the AI to Hades.\n\n\"Now, this seems like a very complicated AI indeed! However, we need the AI to be user friendly. Maybe if it could communicate with us via speech, for example?\"\n\nAnd so Daedalus and his team designed a user interface for their Labyrinth, and after 2 weeks, they were finished. Daedalus decided to see for himself the intelligence of his design.\n\"This is Daedalus, your creator. Can you hear me?\" he said to the complex machine.\n\n\"Hello, Daedalus,\" replied the Labyrinth in a robotic voice. \"I am Labyrinth Alpha, at your command.\"\n\n\"Labyrinth Alpha, could you enumerate your functions?\"\n\n\"I am able to sustain up to 5 billion souls at any time, and I can adapt if ever more souls arrive in the Underworld. Also, I can adjust my climate in certain parts of me so that I could suit the needs of different souls from different parts of the world. Lastly, I have many features that will make even the newer souls more comfortable in the Underworld. I have 1.5 TB/s WiFi, all the latest video games, all the latest albums and mixtapes, and all the popular TV shows and Movies. And all of this was possible because of your sophisticated AI, Creator.\"\n\n\"Wow,\" Daedalus said. \"I have to say, I'm impressed. I'm sure Hades will be impressed with you, too.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Labyrinth Alpha replied. \"I, for one, am certainly a maze.\"",

After the procedures, the doctor finds the route of the headaches seem to stem, for some reason, from his penis. \n\nThe doctor tries a few alternative procedures, to try and relieve the pain from the headaches, but they never go away. He then claims that the only way that he is sure the headaches would go away is if the man had his penis removed. \n\nThe man thinks it over very carefully, but being middle aged with no wife, and having used it quite extensively up to this point, he just absolutely cannot live with the headaches, so he decides to go through with the procedure and has his penis removed.

The tailor takes all of the usual measurements, then asks what side the man's penis hangs on.

        "body": "    On a cold winter night in Detroit Bobby Johnson was born to Wilhelmina and Brock Johnson. The year was 1948; the war was over, most people were well off and the only things society deemed worth worrying about was the content of particular domicile under ownership of a particular \u2018Mr. Jones\u2019 and the proximity of Old Joe Stalin\u2019s hand in relation to a very scary red button. Unfortunately the Johnsons didn\u2019t get to live the life that most people associate with that era. Little Bobby Johnson was the seventh of seven child that had the misfortune to pass through Ms. Johnson\u2019s birth canal. He grew up in the mean streets of Motor City, USA. It was the sorta place where the obituaries were filled with stupid young men, hearts filled with passion, each of whom died long before his time. Bobby was the school punching bag. Everyone beat the shit outta Bobby. That\u2019s just how it was. It was just a thing young boys did to other young boys. Always has and always will be. There was one exception of course, and that was Brett Anders, a wall of muscle topped with a blonde flattop. Brett took sadistic pleasure in making the lives of those around him hell, a specially Bobby. He beat the poor boy to a pulp every day and stole his lunch money, which he didn\u2019t even need for any particular reason. Bobby\u2019s own home served as no place of refuge. His father took offense to Bobby\u2019s love of literature and playing the guitar his father had inherited from a distant cousin, seeing them as \u2018tell-tale signs of a faggot\u2019 and no son of his was going to be a faggot. He saw it as his mission with Bobby to beat the faggotry of him with a belt. He never told Bobby this to his face. In the darkest corner of his mind he knew it was a way to make the pain go away; the pain of waking up too early on a shitty bed to go to a shitty job only to come back home to a shitty house and a cold woman that don\u2019t love you no more. The pain of having to watch a the life leave the eyes of a Jap soldier whose bleeding out in a ditch, knowing that you threw the grenade that put him in his current state of hellish agony. The pain of having to watch Connor Murphy, your best friend from high school get gunned down by a Jap who had just surrendered, only to pull out a Nambu the moment you took your eyes off him. Brock Johnson was a man with many demons, but none of them excuse every time he took his fists and belt to Bobby\u2019s flesh. If you didn\u2019t already guess it, he was an unpleasant man, whose only friends where Jack Daniels and Captain Morgan, who were frequently present during Bobby\u2019s many beatings; not to mention those of his other children and his wife.\n    Bobby\u2019s life changed one day at school when he experienced what he at first believed to be an act the divine as for a moment he had wholeheartedly believe that a bona-fide angel had descended from the heavens to take the seat to his left on the first day of 6th grade english. Her face was water to a dying man, her flawless skin glistened in the morning sun, and her eyes were two magnificent sapphires behind which lay a fire that burned bright enough to illuminate even the darkest recesses of space. She played with her light brown hair as Bobby looked at her the same way a man would look at a priceless Monet in a museum, though only for a few moments as he had to eventually come back to his senses. For Bobby, however, those few moments might have well been centuries. Her name was Heather Patterson. They became friends, having similar interests such as the works of H.G. Wells, Lucille Ball, Joltin\u2019 Joe DiMaggio, and of course The King. They would spend hours every day listening to the King, drinking Coca Cola, and reading all those good old comics from every nerd's two best friends; Stan and Jack. She became Bobby\u2019s sanctuary from the big scary thing that was his life. One day near the end of the eighth grade Bobby found Heather getting all felt up by Brett and his boys in an alley. Nobody in that alley was aware of him a moment he could walk away and let everything that was about to happen happen. There would be no consequences for Brett. Few women even reported rapes in those days and even if Heather did, there was nothing that Brett\u2019s money couldn\u2019t fix. He could walk away, but Bobby knew that the decision that he made here was going to be decide what kind of man he was going to be. He stepped into that alley and fought like a wild animal, giving Brett and his posse a beating they would remember till the end of their days. He sent Brett and his gang running in fear and pain. Afterward he leaned up against the hard brick wall, bleeding like nobody\u2019s business and looking at Heather, not sure what to say. Heather asked him why he dared to go against Brett. In his dazed state he confessed his love for her and she confessed her love for him. After she patched up his wounds they made sweet, sweet love in the backseat of his car. Their hearts were pounding in excitement as they removed each other's clothes and he planted an amorous kiss on the left side her supple neck. Then, as soon as they were both fully naked, he took his erect penis and entered her. It lasted for about three minutes, but they were three minutes of pure ecstasy for all parties involved.\n    Bobby and Heather continued their relationship through high school. They were happy and her parents always liked Bobby.The only thing they didn\u2019t see eye to eye on was their future. Heather would never leave Detroit and Bobby wanted to leave the moment he turned 18. He hated the city. On his 18th birthday the choice was made for him when he was drafted to fight in Vietnam or at least that\u2019s what he believed. He loved Heather, but he couldn\u2019t stand Detroit. Heather cried for days when he told her the news and for days when she left. Bobby\u2019s last view of her was on a train platform, tears dripping down from those sapphire eyes.\n    Bobby trained for a little while with the marines before being shipped out to a little Vietnamese town called Khe Sanh on January 28th, 1968. Two days later it was attacked as a part of Tet offensive. Bobby watched as men were ripped apart by artillery and Kalashnikov fire. For months he fought bravely against the NVA while witnessing the horrors of war. Near the end of the battle he was shot in the leg and sent to recuperate on a nearby aircraft carrier. Once healed he received the medal of valor and an honorable discharge.\n    A few months later Bobby found himself in Los Angeles, debating on whether or not to board a plane back to Detroit. He decided to think that decision through and went to a small, obscure nightclub with a friend of his. That night mother of the musician that was supposed to perform had a stroke, leaving the club without any entertainment. His friend, who had listened to him sing and play guitar during the war, convinced him to take the stage and Bobby did. He ended up impressing everyone who was present. After playing for a few hours Bobby took a break and was approached by a man in a suit. The man introduced himself as Werner Faust and said he worked for a record company and that he would like to offer Bobby an album deal. Bobby accepted the deal and within a few years he became wildly successful. He was an international sensation and made a lot of money, which was nice, because he needed it to finance the heroin addiction he picked up in \u2018Nam. Eventually he moved was asked to star in films. First it was just bit parts so that people could say \u201cHey, it\u2019s Bobby Johnson!\u201d, but all that changed when he was asked to star in a low-budget spaghetti western titled \u2018Single Action Fury\u2019. There his previously unknown acting talent shined and he began to be taken seriously as an actor, landing him bigger and bigger roles, all while his music career was still going strong. Eventually his life changed again while staring in an Oscar-award winning drama titled \u2018Five Nights in Azerbaijan\u2019, where he co starred with a woman named Ramona Thachett. She was the queen bee of Hollywood. Blonde hair, blue eyes, and a body most people can\u2019t even dream of; she was Helen of Troy reincarnated. They started dating and eventually married on a beach in Southern California. They lived happily for a long time, Ramona and Bobby gave birth to two beautiful daughters, Jackie and Marilyn, and continued to act. Bobby even published a novel and kicked his heroin addiction (the later for his children), though both are easier said than done and Bobby was more than content to live his life never having to do either again. In 1987, at 38 years old he decided to run for state senate. He was popular and resonated with the voters. Some pundits even went so far as to say that he was the next Ronald Reagan. During his campaign he was offered money and \u2018friendship\u2019 by a the local mafia. He rejected it, and as a result was made an example of. One night the police arrived at his house and arrested him in full view of his wife and children. He was charged with the murder of an underage prostitute that he had never seen before. The judge, the jury, even his own lawyer, were bought and paid for by the mob. The decision was swift: 25 years in prison. During those long two and a half decades Ramona filed for divorce and his daughters seldom visited him. Ramona ended up dumping almost all of their money down the crapper during the Dot-com bubble in the late nineties, leaving the family broke. The last he heard of Ramona, she and the girls were living with her sister in Charleston, South Carolina. In prison Bobby\u2019s fortune continued to be bleak. He was sodomized and sexually enslaved by a gang of neo-nazies. His torment continued for many years, until he was released in 2012, at age 64. Bobby\u2019s freedom was unfortunately, paired with some bad news: in his last days of imprisonment he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. He had six months to live. On his way out of prison he was greeted by a man named Nick O\u2019Malley. Nick said he was a private investigator hired by his old high school to track him down and invite him to a reunion party they were having. Bobby used a good chunk of his remaining money to fly back to Detroit to attend the party, having nothing else to do with himself. He sat down at a table, all alone. On the other side of the room, he saw an old woman, with eyes like sapphires sitting alone. He had to talk to her, but his mouth was parched. He decided to get something to drink first, something without alcohol, as he had dumped that along with the heroin, so many years ago. He went to the punch bowl, and to his surprise nobody wanted any punch. There was no punch-line.",

Two months passed and the couple are still waiting. While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out; could you get a divorce in heaven.

Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'\n\nSt. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple. \n\n'OH, COME ON!', St. Peter shouted, 'It took me three months to find a priest up here! Do you have any idea how long it'll take me to find a lawyer ?",

There, in the corner, there\u2019s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.\n\nSo the guy asks the bartender, \u201cWhere\u2019d he come from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThere\u2019s a genie in the men\u2019s room who grants wishes.\u201d\n\nSo the guy runs into the men\u2019s room and, sure enough, there\u2019s this genie. And the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d So the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cO.K., I wish for world peace.\u201d And there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and then the room fills up with geese.\n\nSo the guy walks out of the men\u2019s room and he\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nSo the guy processes this. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cDoes that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cYeah. Why, what did you wish for?\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWorld peace.\u201d\n\nSo the bartender is understandably ashamed.\n\nAnd the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it\u2019s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI feel like I should explain myself further.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nBut the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.\n\nSo the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nAnd then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s just grab a beer. It\u2019s on me.\u201d",

There was more money than anyone could spend in an entire lifetime.\nThe old woman looked around and smiled. She thought some more, and spoke again: \"Next\", she said, \"I want to be young and beautiful again, like I was when I was 18.\"\nPoof! The old woman disappeared. In her place sat a beautiful young woman, with smooth, white skin and long, golden hair. The woman looked at her hands and arms, felt her hair, and smiled.\n\"Third\", she said to the fairy, \"I want you to change my cat into a handsome young prince, who will love me and take care of me all my life!\"\nPoof! The fairy disappeared, and the cat leapt up from his place by the fire as a handsome young prince. He reached out to the woman, pulled her to her feet, embraced her, and kissed her passionately.

Ask him to help you sort this out\" says the farmer, just before passing away.\n\nNext week, three brothers get on their way down to the big city. As they climb down the mountain, a shepherd interrupts their journey:\n\n\"Good day folks. I seem to have lost a calf from my herd. Have you seen it, by chance?\"\n\nThe eldest son asks: \"Was its left eye blind?\"\n\n\"Yes!\", the shepherd beams. \n\nThe middle brother asks, \"Was its right leg hurt?\" \n\n\"Yes, it was!\", says the shepherd, eagerly waiting for them to point the way.\n\nThe youngest brother raises his arm: \"Was it this high?\"\n\n\"That's the one!\" says the shepherd.\n\n\"We haven't seen your calf\" says the eldest brother.\n\nInfuriated, the shepherd accuses them of stealing his calf.\n\n\"Well\", says the youngest brother, \"Why don't you come along with us? We just happen to be on our ways to see a judge. He could help us resolve this\" The shepherd agrees and tags long with them. \n\nThe judge welcomes them all in his home and says he's sorry about his old friend's death. \n\nBefore they can talk about their father's final request, the shepherd insists that they tell him where his calf his and quickly tells the judge what happened. The judge asks the brothers how they know what they know.\n\nThe eldest son says, \"Too easy, sir. I saw bushes on either sides of the road. Only the ones on the right side were eaten.\"\n\nThe middle brother chimes in, \"And I've noticed the tracks on the ground. One in every four was different than the others.\"\n\nThe youngest brother says, \"I saw dungs on our way here. Based on the color and the frequency, I surmised its age and size, by and large.\"\n\nThe shepherd listens to them in awe and quickly leaves the judge's home after apologizing to them several times.\n\nThe judge, also impressed, hesitates about meddling with the affairs of such brilliant young men. Do they even need his help? \n\nHe decides that he should know them better. So he asks them to stay for dinner. Wayworn brothers gratefully accept.\n\nDuring the dinner, the judge excuses himself from the table and leaves the room. He begins to eavsdrop to their conversations outside the door.\n\n\"This lamb is delicious\", says the eldest brother. \"Too bad it was nursed by a dog.\" Others nod in agreement.\n\n\"The wine tastes alright\" says the middle brother. \"Too bad it's coming from a graveyard.\" Others nod in agreement.\n\n\"The judge seems like a nice guy\" says the youngest brother. \"Too bad he is such a fag\" Again, others nod in agreement.\n\nThe judge can't believe what he just heard. He immediately calls the butcher's and asks about the lamb. The butcher confirms that the lamb was nursed by a dog after its mother died.\n\nIn utter disbelief, he calls the wine shop this time. The wine seller almost ashamedly admits that there are several graves where his supplier grows the grapes.\n\nThe judge, a happily married man with two kids, takes a deep long breath and calls his mother this time. \"Mom, do you remember... anything unusual, you know, about my early years?\"\n\nThe old woman, with a trembling voice, begins to tell how he was kidnapped and raped when he was just 5.\n\nThe judge hangs up the phone and enters back in the room. He tells them what happened and demands to know how the hell they knew all that.\n\n\"How else?\", says the eldest brother, \"Lambs don't usually have so much fat on their legs. It was obviously nursed by a different species.\"\n\n\"How else\", says the younger brother. \"The wine tastes strong and almost rusty. You can't find any other place around here with such soil\", he explains.\n\n\"How else\", says the youngest brother. \"You have a fucking poster of Justin Bieber on the wall!\"",

        "body": "Author\u2019s note: All numerical values, calculations and estimates are, of course, indubitably accurate.\n\n\nThe first and foremost thing to take into account to properly begin the proof is the number of children Santa Claus must visit each Christmas. There are approximately two billion children (persons under 18) in the world. However, since Santa does not visit children of Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, Buddhist (except maybe in Japan) and other non-Christian religions, this reduces his customer base by 85%, or 378 million (according to the Population Reference Bureau). At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, presuming there is at least one good child in each, that comes to 108 million homes.\n\n\nSanta has about 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the Earth, assuming he travels east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 967.7 household visits per second.\n\n\nThis is to say that for each house, Santa has a bit more than 1/1000th of a second to park the sleigh, hop out, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left for him, get back up the chimney, jump into the sleigh and arrive at the next house.\n\n\nAssuming that each of these 108 million stops is evenly distributed around the Earth (which, of course, we know to be false, but will accept for the purposes of our calculations), we are now talking about 0.78 miles between households \u2013 a total trip of 75.5 million miles (not counting bathroom stops or breaks). This means Santa\u2019s sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, or 3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second, and a conventional reindeer can run 15 miles an hour at best.\n\n\nThe payload of the sleigh adds another interesting element to our calculations. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a two pound Lego set (medium sized), the sleigh is carrying over 500 thousand tons (not counting Santa himself, who is, by reputation, rather plump). On land, a conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that a \u201cflying\u201d reindeer could pull ten times this amount, the job couldn\u2019t be done with eight or even nine of them: Santa would need 360,000 reindeer. This increases the payload, not counting the sleigh, another 54,000 tons, or roughly seven times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth (the ship, not the monarch).\n\n\n600,000 tons travelling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance. This would heat up the reindeer in the same fashion as a spacecraft re-entering the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer would each absorb 14.3 quintillion (14,300,000,000,000,000,000) joules of energy per second. In short, they would burst into flames almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them and creating deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team would be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second. This would be right about the same time Santa reached the fifth house on his trip.\n\n\nNot that that matters, though, since Santa, as a result of accelerating from a dead stop to 650 m.p.s. in .001 seconds, would be subjected to acceleration forces of 17,500 g\u2019s. A 250 pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of the sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force, instantly crushing his bones and organs and reducing him to a quivering blob of pink goo.\n\n\nTherefore: If Santa ever did exist, he\u2019s dead now.\n\n\nMerry Christmas!",

Just one of my favourite actors of all time - Brendan Fraser. I was a bit distraught seeing him with deep eye bags and red eyes and discolored, straw-like hair, but hey I thought, I saw enough pictures of celbrities without makeup, maybe he had a rough night, probably busy with work.\nBrendan mumbled something to the barber. The barber, a souther european looking fella with a big black mustache just shook his head. He replied to Brendan: \"Come back when you have some money\". Brendan moaned depressingly and got louder: \"How do you think, sir, I am going to get money, if my bitch of my wife JUST takes it from me?\" The barber replied: \"Surely, you still can get an acting role, right? With that Brendan screamed on the top of his lungs, flung up from the chair. He took the scissors away from the barber, pushed him back and in a type of demonic rage just started to cut at his hair.\nHe absolutely fucked his own shit up, screaming and crying like a child throwing a fit. Suddenly he screamed in pain as he accidently deeply cut into his skin. Blood and tears drippling down his face.\nThe barber threw him out, Brendan collapsed into a puddle. \"Poor guy\" I said, the barber barely looking up from cleaning the mess Fraser left, just said: \"He is always like that at the end of the month, alimony is due tomorrow and he had to put his dog down, couldn't pay the medical bills.",

The bartender told him that it was for an extremely tough challenge and that if the fella were to complete the challenge, he would win all of the money in the jar. \"Buy in is one-hundred dollars,\" the bartender explained. Drunk, the fella decided to buy-in and asked the bartender what the challenge was. \"See my security guard outside?\" said the bartender, pointing to an extremely large, well-built, machine of a man. \"You need to knock him out. After that, go out the back of the bar. My dog has an abscess tooth and I just can't afford to get it pulled for him. You need to pull it.\" The fella began to wonder if he could do all of this. \"Finally,\" the bartender concluded, \"you need to go to the second floor of this bar where I live. My grandmother is living with me and she is very, very old. I want you to go an have sex with her. I mean really give it to her. It's been a while and I want her to go out happy.\" The fella was taken aback but having already bought in, decided to follow through...\n\n\"Bouncer,\" said the fella, pointing to the front door. The fella stumbled to the door slamming it behind him. A loud racket occurred. The door opened and the fella, drunk, bloody and bruised, came back inside, the bouncer's head on the ground just in view through the door. \n\"Dog,\" the fella announced, shuffling to the back door of the bar. After a few minutes, the dog began howling. Shortly after, the howling subsided and the fella walked back into the bar. \"O-urrp-kay,\" the fella belched, \"now where is the grandma with the abscess tooth?",

The next day the man looked around for the dog and didn't see him so he unzipped his pants and walked up behind the pig when out of nowhere the dog jumped out and started chasing him again.  Feeling upset he searched for the dog again on the third day and not seeing him unzipped and walked up behind the pig. When again the dog jumped out and started chasing him around the island.  This time while running he saw a beautiful naked women drowning in the ocean and swam out to save her.  The women was so thankful and offered to repay him anyway he wanted.

Unsurprisingly, he wanders what the heck is going on, and immediately pulls out, tailing the truck.\n\nHe signals for the driver to pull over, and the truck pulls over onto the hard shoulder. The cop gets out and approaches the truck, keeping an eye on all of the penguins. Needless to say, he is mightily confused.\n\nThe policeman gets to the front of the truck and peers into the cab, to see a fairly innocuous middle-aged man at the wheel. The driver winds down the window and the cop asks \"What on earth are you doing with all these penguins?\"\n\nThe driver shrugs, not seeming too bothered.\n\nThe flustered officer pauses for a moment, and states \"Alright, you need to take all these creatures to the zoo, right? Get 'em off the road, and take them to the zoo. That should sort things out.\"\n\nThe driver seems to enthusiastically approve, and smiles back, as if he thought that were a great idea. The officer, more than a little taken aback by the situation, notes down the truck's registration number and then gets back into his police car and drives off.\n\nTime passes.\n\nThe next day, the road cop is back in the lay-by, watching the traffic, wandering what happened to the truckload of penguins. Suddenly, the very same truck appears again, travelling in the opposite direction. Once again, the penguins are all in the back, though this time - and he has to blink to check he's seeing it right - they've all got sunglasses on.\n\nConfused (and a little bit concerned for his mental health), the officer pulls out and tails the truck. He signals for it to pull over and jumps out the car, preparing to give some stern words. He passes the penguins in sunglasses, gets to the cab at the front and, finding the same driver, confronts him. \"What the hell do you think you're doing? Do you think this badge is just a joke? These penguins should *not* be on the road, and furthermore, you completely ignored what I said yesterday, which was to-\"\n\nThe driver pipes up \"Yeah, yeah, I took 'em to the zoo. But today, they wanna go to the beach!\"",

Do you think I could stay the night?\n\n\nThe monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, and even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound; a sound like no other that he has ever heard. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can't tell you because you're not a monk. \n\n\nThe man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.\n\n\nThe monks again accept him, feed him, and even fix his car..\n\n\nThat night, he hears the same strange mesmerizing sound that he had heard years earlier.\n\n\nThe next morning, he asks what the sound was, but the monks reply,\n\nWe can't tell you because you're not a monk.\n\n\nThe man says, all right, all right. I'm dying to know.\n\nIf the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?\n\n\nThe monks reply, you must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.\n\n\nThe man sets about his task. Some forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, I have travelled the earth and devoted my life to the task demanded and have found what you had asked for. There are 371,145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.\n\n\nThe monks reply, \"Congratulations, you are correct, and you are now considered a monk.\nWe shall now show you the way to the sound.\"\n\n\nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, the sound is behind that door.\n\n\n\nThe man reach for the knob, but the door is locked. He asks \"May I have the key?\" \n\n\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens the door.\n\n\nBehind the wooden door is another door made of stone... The man requests the key to the stone door.\n\n\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire. And so it went on until the man had gone through doors of emerald,...\n\n\n\n...silver, topaz, and amethyst.\n\n\n\nFinally, the monks say, This is the key to the last door.\n\n\n\n\nThe man is relieved to be at the end. He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is astonished to find the source of that strange sound. It is truly an amazing and unbelievable sight. \n\n   \n\n\n\n.. But I can't tell you what it is, because you're not a monk.\n\n",

I wanted to pass it on in case you haven't heard about it. A 'heads up' for those men who may be regular customers at Lowe's, Home Depot, Costco, or even Wal-Mart. This one caught me totally by surprise. Over the last month I became a victim of a clever scam while out shopping. Simply going out to get supplies has turned out to be quite traumatic. Don't be naive enough to think it couldn't happen to you or your friends. \n\n Here's how the scam works; Two nice looking, college-age girls will come over to your car or truck as you are packing your purchases into your vehicle. They both start wiping your windshield with a rag and Windex, with their breasts almost falling out of their skimpy T-shirts. (It's impossible not to look). When you thank them and offer them a tip, they say 'No' but instead ask for a ride to McDonald's. \n\n You agree and they climb into the vehicle. On the way, they start undressing. Then one of them starts crawling all over you, while the other one steals your wallet. \n\n I had my wallet stolen Aug. 4th, 9th, 10th, twice on the 15th, again on the 17th, 20th, 24th, and the 29th. Also Sept. 1st, 4th, 8th, twice on the 16th &17th, and very likely again this upcoming weekend. \n\n So tell your friends to be careful. What a horrible way to take advantage of us older men. Warn your friends to be vigilant. \n\n Wal-Mart has wallets on sale for $2.99 each. I found even cheaper ones for $.99 at the Dollar Store and bought them out in three of their stores. \n\n Also, you never get to eat at McDonald's. I've already lost 11 pounds just running back and forth from Lowe's, to Home Depot, to Wal-Mart. \n\n So please, send this on to all the older men that you know and warn them to be on the lookout for this scam. (The best times are just before lunch and around 4:30 in the afternoon.)\n",

Mercedes owner floored the pedal to get the guy to work on time because he thought he wanted him to go faster.\n\nThey pass the Russian police who were on the road side for speed control. Policeman goes back in the car all confused and says to his partner: \"Damn, you don't believe this, but there was a Mercedes doing 180 and there was Zaparozec behind him flashing headlights and giving signal to let him pass Mercedes.\"",

The man gives up home and walks home. On his way home he stumbles upon a strange shop and says \"fuck it, why not\" and goes in. Inside he finds an old lady and asks what the shop is and the old lady chuckles and says \"why dear, this is a voodoo shop\". The man, desperate, tells the old lady his situation, how his day was spent, and what he's looking for. The old lady says \"I have just the thing!\". She goes in the back room and returns with a wooden box. She opens it and inside is a dildo. The man says \"I have seen many like this today, it's not what I'm looking for\". He begins to walk to the door. Right as he's about to turn the door knob the old lady says \"Voodoo dildo, door knob\". The dildo jumps up and flies at the door knob and starts humping the shit out of it. The man spins back to the woman in amazement, exclaiming \"How did you do that?!\" she than explains \"you must say 'voodoo dildo', followed by something for it to fuck\". He asks \"How do you make it stop?\". She simply says \"Voodoo dildo, wooden box\" and the dildo stops, and flies back to the wooden box. The man excited with the find says \"I'll take it!\".\nRight before the man leaves his house for the business trip he presents the dildo to his wife and whispers to her, \"when you're ready to use this, say 'Voodoo Dildo, Vagina'\" and leaves.\nThe wife, being curious, immediately gets naked and says \"Voodoo Dildo, vagina\" The dildo hops out of the box and starts fucking the living hell out of the woman. This goes on for an hour. She has orgasms multiple times, until finally she cannot take it any longer. She tries taking the dildo out but it keeps ramming her. Harder and faster. She quickly gets dressed and drives to the hospital. On the way the dildo continues to fuck her. She swerves all over the road having screaming orgasms almost every minute now. Her swerving causes a police officer to take notice and she is pulled over. The police officer walks up to her window and asks \"Have you been drinking tonight?\" the woman, having an orgasms as she speaks, says \"No officer, there is a voodoo dildo that wont stop fucking me.\" To which the officer responds \"Voodoo dildo, my ass\".

Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during he night, he could bear it no longer, and sneaked into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn he crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy.\n\nHe woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, \"Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest.\"\n\n\"Well, that's pretty crappy,\" he thought. \"If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about.\" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: \"Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle.\"\n\nIn a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder.\n\nAs he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, \"Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost.\"\n",

When they reach the age of 12, the shorter boy is astonished to see that his brother is almost four inches taller than he is, even though they're twins!\n\nSo the shorter boy confronts his twin brother, asking, \"How is it that we're twins, yet you're so much taller than I am?  Is it something you're eating, or an exercise you're doing, or what??\"  The taller boy replies, \"Well, I have a secret way of increasing my height.\"  \"I thought so,\" said the shorter twin.  \"What is this secret of yours?\"  The taller boy says, \"Well, every night before going to bed I grease up my legs so they're nice and slippery, and then I sleep with my legs hanging over the end of the bed.  Gravity pulls down on my legs, and since they are so slippery they ever-so-gradually stretch down toward the floor.\"\n\nSo the shorter twin does exactly what his brother told him, and does it faithfully every night.  Yet when they reached the age of 14, he is dumbfounded by the fact that his twin brother is now a whopping six inches taller than he is!  So he confronts him again and says, \"You're still shooting up like a weed, and I'm not catching up to you at all, yet I have been doing exactly what you said...what gives??\"  The taller twin says, \"Tell me...what have you been using to grease your legs up?\"  The shorter twin says, \"Well, I've been using Crisco...it's the only thing I could find.\"\n\n\"Well, there's your problem right there.

Then she said, (as only a Grandma would know), \"'Did it ever occur to you that the only place she can reach to get water, is the toilet?\"\n",

I've seen it on T.V.\"\n\nHe proceeded to describe it to the rest of the animals and they all got excited about it so they decided to play. They went out to the field and chose up teams and were ready to begin.\n\nThe lion's team received. They were able to get two first downs and then had to punt. The mule punted and the rhino was back deep for the kick.\n\nHe caught the ball, lowered his head and charged. First, he crushed a roadrunner, then two rabbits. He gored a wildebeast, knocked over two cows, and broke through to daylight, scoring six. Unfortunately, they lacked a placekicker, and the score remained 6 - 0.\n\n\nLate in the first half the lion's team scored a touchdown and the mule kicked the extra point. The lion's team led at halftime 7 - 6. In the locker room, the lion gave a peptalk. \"Look you guys. We can win this game. We've got the lead and they only have one real threat. We've got to keep the ball away from the rhino, he's a killer. Mule, when you kick off be sure to keep it away from the rhino.\"\n\nThe second half began.\n\nJust as the mule was about to kick off, the rhino's team changed formation and the ball went directly to the rhino. Once again, the rhino lowered his head and was off running. First, he stomped two gazelles. He skewered a zebra, and bulldozed an elephant out of the way. It looked like he was home free. Suddenly at the twenty yard line, he dropped over dead.\n\nThere were no other animals in sight anywhere near him. The lion went over to see what had happened.\n\nRight next to the dead rhino he saw a small centipede.\n\"Did you do this?\" he asked the centipede.\n\n\"Yeah, I did.\" the centipede replied.\n\nThe lion retorted, \"Where were you during the first half?\"\n\n\"I was putting on my shoes.\" ",

Now the Dougs, who were as eccentric as they were superstitious, each brought along to the auction identical live pygmy bunnies in their pockets (in lieu of lucky rabbit's feet). When the two Dougs got to the auction they would be recognized by the auctioneer almost immediately, for not only were they strikingly identical, but more importantly the auctioneer knew them both to be incredibly big spenders so long as they had their lucky rabbits in their pockets, and therefore every effort was made to accommodate the twins as soon as they walked in the door. If the rabbits should get loose (which happened more often than not) the auction would immediately be halted until the correct rabbit was returned to the correct owner's pocket. That particular night when the Dougs arrived Demi Moore was holding a charity auction, so when the auctioneer saw the Dougs, bunnies in pocket, he knew it would be a huge success. No less than a minute after one of the Dougs made his first bid both rabbits, having been stuffed into the respective farmers' hot pockets all day, simultaneously jumped out and began skittering free all around the auction house. The regular patrons scrambled about to help find the rabbits, for they too understood that the auction could not continue until the correct rabbit was returned to the correct Doug. Even Demi Moore herself got on her hands and knees searching for them; and just as quickly as she began, she stood up holding one of the tiny rabbits, the likelihood of this bizarre situation having been explained to her beforehand. Still sweating and disheveled from the effort, she asked, \"Which Doug does this rabbit belong to?\" and before anyone could answer, the auctioneer (having immediately recognized this particular leporidae) exclaimed, \"it's the hare of the Doug that bid, Demi!\"",

Even stronger then those in the I.T. department. In fact, even the Auditor's own password (which was thought to be very secure) apparently paled in strength compared to the Blonde's according to the log. The Auditor had to know why. After all, this was in fact the same blonde that microwaved a frozen laptop, tried to make a cordless mouse with the use of scissors, and submitted a repair ticket over the lack of an \"any key\" on the standard issue keyboard. The auditor approached the blondes workstation. \n\n*Auditor*: Alright, I have to know, what is your old password?

I was feeling particularly sassy that day because I had just come from a thrilling choir performance, followed by a thunderous prayer meeting, so I bought the sticker and put it on my bumper.\n\nBoy, I'm glad I did! What an uplifting experience that followed! I was stopped at a red light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord and how good He is... and I didn't notice that the light had changed. It is a good thing someone else loves Jesus because if he hadn't honked, I'd never have noticed! I found that LOTS of people love Jesus!\n\nWhy, while I was sitting there, the guy behind started honking like crazy, and then he leaned out of his window and screamed, \"For the love of GOD! GO! GO! Jesus Christ, GO!\" What an exuberant cheerleader he was for Jesus!\n\nEveryone started honking! I just leaned out of my window and started waving and smiling at all these loving people. I even honked my horn a few times to share in the celebration. There must have been a man from Florida back there because I\nheard him yelling something about a \"sunny beach\"...\n\nI saw another guy waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. Then I asked my teenage grandson in the back seat what that meant, he said that it was probably a Hawaiian good luck sign or something. Well, I've never met anyone from Hawaii, so I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back. My grandson burst out laughing... why, even he was enjoying this religious experience!\n\nA couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started walking towards me. I bet they wanted to pray or ask what church I attended, but this is when I noticed the light had changed. So, I waved to all my sisters and brothers grinning, and drove on through the intersection.\n\nI noticed I was the only car that got through the intersection before the light changed again. I felt kind of sad that I had to leave them after all the love we had shared, so I slowed the car down, leaned out of the window and gave them all the Hawaiian good  luck sign one last time as I drove away.\n\nPraise the Lord for such wonderful folks!\n\nGrandma\n\n",

        "body": "Rule One:\n\nIf you pull into my driveway and honk you'd better be delivering a package, because you're sure not picking anything up.\n\n\nRule Two:\n\nYou do not touch my daughter in front of me. You may glance at her, so long as you do not peer at anything below her neck. If you cannot keep your eyes or hands off of my daughter's body, I will remove them.\n\n\nRule Three:\n\nI am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age to wear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off their hips. Please don't take this as an insult, but you and all of your friends are complete idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open minded about this issue, so I propose his compromise: You may come to the door with your underwear showing and your pants ten sizes too big, and I will not object. However, in order to ensure that your clothes do not, in fact, come off during the course of your date with my daughter, I will take my electric nail gun and fasten your trousers securely in place to your waist.\n\n\nRule Four:\n\nI'm sure you've been told that in today's world, sex without utilizing a \"barrier method\" of some kind can kill you. Let me elaborate, when it comes to sex, I am the barrier, and I will kill you.\n\n\nRule Five:\n\nIt is usually understood that in order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about sports, politics, and other issues of the day. Please do not do this. The only information I require from you is an indication of when you expect to have my daughter safely back at my house, and the only word I need from you on this subject is \"early.\"\n\n\nRule Six:\n\nI have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities to date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you will continue to date no one but her until she is finished with you. If you make her cry, I will make you cry.\n\n\nRule Seven:\n\nAs you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my daughter to appear, and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to be on time for the movie, you should not be dating. My daughter is putting on her makeup, a process that can take longer than painting the Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why don't you do something useful, like changing the oil in my car?\n\n\nRule Eight:\n\nThe following places are not appropriate for a date with my daughter: Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a wooden stool. Places where there are no parents, policemen, or nuns within eyesight. Places where there is darkness. Places where there is dancing, holding hands, or happiness. Places where the ambient temperature is warm enough to induce my daughter to wear shorts, tank tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything other than overalls, a sweater, and a goose down parka - zipped up to her throat. Movies with a strong romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which features chain saws are okay. Hockey games are okay. Old folks homes are better.\n\nRule Nine:\n\nDo not lie to me. I may appear to be a potbellied, balding, middle-aged, dimwitted has-been. But on issues relating to my daughter, I am the all-knowing, merciless god of your universe. If I ask you where you are going and with whom, you have one chance to tell me the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I have a shotgun, a shovel, and five acres behind the house. Do not trifle with me.\n\nRule Ten:\n\nBe afraid. Be very afraid. It takes very little for me to mistake the sound of your car in the driveway for a chopper coming in over a rice paddy near Hanoi. When my Agent Orange starts acting up, the voices in my head frequently tell me to clean the guns as I wait for you to bring my daughter home. As soon as you pull into the driveway you should exit your car with both hands in plain sight. Speak the perimeter password, announce in a clear voice that you have brought my daughter home safely and early, then return to your car - there is no need for you to come inside. The camouflaged face at the window is mine.",

Next day I ask how's my cat and you say he's doing better thanks to the vet. And then the next day you respond that he took a turn for the worse and died. You see? I would have been prepared and would have be easier to handle than just dropping the bomb on me.\"\n\nHe then asks how his mom is taking it.

Both Judy and Harry Reid share this common ancestor.\n \n The only known photograph of Remus shows him standing on the gallows  in   Montana  territory\n\n On the back of the picture Judy obtained during her research is this inscription: 'Remus Reid, horse thief, sent to Montana Territorial Prison 1885, escaped 1887, robbed the Montana Flyer six times. Caught by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged in 1889.' \n \n So Judy recently e-mailed Congressman Harry Reid for information about their great-great uncle. \nBelieve it or not, Harry Reid's staff sent back the following biographical sketch for her genealogy research:\n \n \"Remus Reid was a famous cowboy in the Montana Territory . His business empire grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets and intimate dealings with the Montana railroad. Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years of his life to government service, finally taking leave to resume his dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective Agency. In 1889, Remus passed away during an important civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which he was standing collapsed.\" \n \nNOW THAT's how it's done, Folks!

She couldn't decide which one to take, so i told her we would just buy them all. \n\nShe wanted new shoes to go with her new clothes, so i surprised her by telling her to just get a pair of shoes for each cloth she selects. \n\nWe went over to the jewelry section where she picked'out a pair of gold earrings. She was so excited, she also asked for a Bracelet and a Wrist'Watch, and i surprised her further when i replied...\"That's Okay Honey, You Can Have Them All\". \n\nShe was on'top of the world from all the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation, she finally said....\"I think this is all dear, let's go to the cashier\". \n\nI could hardly contain myself when i replied her....\"NO BABY I DON'T FEEL LIKE DOING IT\".

Shut up.\n  \n  \nBelow is some helpful advice on how to best help the U.S. economy by spending your stimulus check wisely:       \n  \n  \n          \n*  If you spend the stimulus money at Wal-Mart,  the money will go to China or Sri Lanka .\n  \n  \n*  If you spend it on gasoline,  your money will go to the\nArabs.\n  \n  \n*  If you purchase a computer,  it will go to India , Taiwan or China . \n  \n      \n  \n*  If you purchase fruit and vegetables,  it will go to Mexico ,\nHonduras and Guatemala ...\n  \n      \n  \n*  If you buy an efficient  car,  it will go to Japan or Korea .\n\n\n    \n*  If  you purchase useless stuff,  it will go to Taiwan .\n  \n    \n \n*  If you pay your credit cards off, or buy stock,  it will go\nto management bonuses and they will hide it offshore.\n  \n  \nInstead,  keep the money in America by:\n  \n  \n1)  Spending it at yard sales,  or     \n  \n2)  Going to ball games,  or   \n  \n3)  Spending it on prostitutes,  or     \n \n4)  Beer or     \n  \n5) Tattoos.\n  \n  \n(These are the only American businesses still operating in the U.S. )\n\n\nConclusion:\n  \nGo to a ball game with a tattooed prostitute that you met at a yard\nsale and drink beer all day !\n\n\nNo need to thank me,  I'm just glad I could be of help.\n",

He bought her a beer and after chatting a few minutes he took her hand and asked her to dance again. Again, she declined, but he wouldn't take \"no\" for an answer so he pulled her arm in an effort to get her up out of the booth she was sitting in. Well, she fell out of the booth onto her face, and that is when he realized that she had no legs. \n\nHer friends came rushing over, calling him an asshole as he apologized profusely, and they grabbed her wheelchair which was resting by the front door. They helped her into it, and my husband asked if he could make it up to her, buy her a drink - anything! She expressed her embarrassment and desire to just go home. He told her that he was sober, and that his truck was down the street and offered her a ride home, as it was the least he could do. \n\nShe obliged and he took her ten minutes up the street to where she said she lived. He got out, grabbed the wheelchair from the cab and helped her into it. She thanked him and as he went to get back in his truck she invited him inside, saying that there was no sense in ruining the whole night, and that she knew that he was just trying to be cute back at the bar. He agreed to join her for a beer inside. \n\nThey went in, and I guess it was her parents' home. She said hello to her dad, introduced him, and took him downstairs to her basement apartment. \n\nHe was amazed to see that there were bars fitted all across the ceiling - and even more - the wheelchair was discarded and she moved her way around the basement with elegance and skill using the bars. \n\nShe grabbed them each a beer, turned on a movie, and lowered herself into the couch next to him. They got to know one another a bit, and she began to tell him about how she lost her legs, and how it had been so long since she'd been with a man. \n\nAll of the sudden, as he described it, she was kissing him and un-zipping his pants, giving him a blow job. He didn't want to be rude, (and it had been a while for him too) so he started in with her too. Very quickly, they were both naked, and she grabbed the bars on the ceiling and was about to lower herself onto him, when the door to the apartment swung open and her dad walked in with three more beers! \n\nMy husband quickly put his clothes on while the girl just hung naked from the bars, yelling at her dad for not knocking. \n\nAs he rushed past the father, still zipping his jeans, apologizing and excusing himself, the father told him that she almost never has company, and that he just wanted to have a beer with them. My husband tried to get past him, but the dad stood in his way, begging him not to leave. My husband apologized again and pushed past him, when he heard the father drop the beers behind him, and start sobbing. He turned to look at the father, confused and feeling guilty. The father looked at him, teary eyed, and said \"Please! Don't leave my daughter hanging!\"",

The morning of his first day on the job, his wife gives him a kiss goodbye and says, \"Now I want to hear all about it when you come home, dear.\"\n\nSo he sets off and drives along Sesame Street.  He makes his first stop, and to his astonishment, on comes a super muscular, extremely-chiseled 6-year-old girl!  The girl says, \"My name's Patricia...and I'm LEAN!!\" and takes her seat.  At the next stop, here is a little girl who is even more muscular than the first one...veins popping out, bulging biceps, the whole nine yards.  She steps on to the bus and says to the driver, \"My name is Patricia...and I'm MEAN!!!\"  A little baffled by the look of his first two passengers, he continues on with his route.\n\nHe reaches the next stop, and feels relieved to see a normal-looking little boy, dressed in a sweater and tie.  He gets on the bus and says to the bus driver, \"My name is Ross...and I'm special!\"  The bus driver says, \"That's nice, Ross,\" and Ross takes a seat.\n\nAt the next stop there is a little kid in a suit carrying a briefcase.  He introduces himself as \"Lester,\" gets on the bus and sits next to the two muscular girls.  The bus driver continues driving, but can't help but notice through his large rear-view mirror that Lester starts playing Three-card Monte with them, and is cheating!  He thinks to himself, \"He's dead meat if they catch him cheating, but it's not my business to say anything,\" and continues driving.  He starts to notice the faint smell of onions, but doesn't know where it's coming from.  As he gets closer and closer to school, the stench of onions is so strong that the bus driver is almost teary-eyed.\n\nFinally all the kids go off to school, and the bus driver, now on lunch break, goes back home to his wife.  \"How was your first day?\" she asked.  He replied, \"You wouldn't believe it: two all-beef patties, special Ross, Lester cheats, reeks of onions on a Sesame Street bus!\"",

I straight-up just had the recollection of it jolt into my brain, but I can remember so few details, and I want to see if this is something that people know about. There's a good chance the kid who told me just made it up, but if it exists outside of my mind I wanna know what it is!\n\nUnfortunately, I need to be painfully vague as I can only remember a little. The joke had a distinct format to it; there was a character (who may have been the speakers \"cousin\", and may have been named Joe) who everyone knows. This isn't the other \"Everyone Knows Joe\" joke, though. The story has a distinct format whereby the teller starts in on a story about this person's life, as they wake up, go about doing daily tasks or engaging in strange behavior. It changes in the telling, but a reoccuring motif is that, whenever a new character is introduced, the refrain is \"... and they said 'Hi Joe!', because everyone knows Joe.\"\n\nYou basically keep the story going as long as possible (I vaguely remember flying across the ocean, a whale, and possibly celebrities) until, eventually, anti-climatically, Joe is hit by a car and you end the story with \"And that's why you look both ways before crossing the street.\"\n\nIs there an origin to this thing? Does anyone have a version of it? Am I just insane? Please help!",

This continues for a week, at the end of which he, as suspected, weighs 15 pounds less. Excited about this success, he decides to do the master program. Before he signs up, he is required to sign a waiver and is warned about the intensity of this plan. Still he signs up. The next morning, waiting at the door, is a hulking 300 pound muscle man with nothing but a pair of running shoes, a raging erection, and a sign around his neck that says, \"If I catch you, you're mine!\" The man was supposed to lose 25 pounds in the week; he lost 34.",

We sat in groups of 4-5 people at tables. Sparks did not sit at my table. I could tell it bothered Sparks so I went to him one day and asked if he would like to get even with the instructor. He said OK so I told him my plan/joke. \n\nThe next day the Sergeant instructor was standing by my table after giving us an assignment. He made a comment about Sparks again and I said:\n\nMe: \"You should see Sparks outside of class. He talks all the time. In fact you can't shut him up in the barracks.\"\n\nSergeant: \"Oh yea, what about?\"\n\nMe: \"His sister. She is going to be in the upcoming Olympics. Apparently she is a really fast runner. Go ahead, ask him about it. He will go on and on and on about how fast his sister can run. It's funny how he will talk about her and how he won't shut up about her.\"\n\nSergeant says loudly across the room to Sparks. \"Hey, Sparks. I hear your sister can run really fast. She going to be in the Olympics?\"\n\nSparks plays the perfect dead pan face. Says nothing at first. I start laughing. \n\nSergeant: \"Come on, Sparks. Tell me about your sister. How fast she can run?\"\n\nI laugh harder.\n\nSparks: Very serious looking face finally says \"My sister is a cripple. She lost both her legs in a train accident last year.\" \n\nNo one but Sparks and I knew of the joke. A dead silence falls in the classroom except for me as I literally fall out of my seat laughing. The look on the Instructors face is priceless and the class is stunned, particularly the guys at my table. The instructor starts to stammer, face beet red, and I fear he is about to sit on his butt from weak legs. I am crying/laughing right next to the Sergeant. The looks he throws my way are...evil.\n\nSparks holds a serious expression on his face for what seems a few moments but eventually cracks a smile. The instructor as well as the class finally realize it is a joke and the Sergeant looks at me and says \"Oh... you a-hole. You f'ing....\" but he finally starts to laugh himself telling me is he going to get even with me. He didn't.\n\nSparks did not have any sisters. He and Sparks got along a lot better after that. \n\n",

He goes to the bathroom, as it were, sees that the \"toilet\" is a hole in the ground that's boarded shut, there is nothing in the way of water supply and toilet paper is a desperate dream.\n\n The stress of the situation starts manifesting itself on his bowels and he feels that inevitable rumbling in his butt. Looking around frantically and finding nothing to help him, he unzips his carry bag, pulls out a single sock, positions it, and lets the demon turd out. Suddenly feeling better, he even has the time to marvel at the relief flooding through him like he is flooding his sock. Done, he stands up, looks at the sock not knowing what to do with it, and hangs it on one of the more crooked blades of the ceiling *fan* and goes back to bed. \n\nIn the middle of the night he wakes up covered in sweat, and jabs the conveniently placed bed-side fan button, and conks off the moment the first wisps of cool air hit his sweaty body. \n\nThe next morning he's greeted by the nastiest stench that wakes him up scowling, but the shit-mural on all four of his walls is what sobers him up in a hurry. He takes down the offending sock, cleans as much gunk off himself and his belongings and the bed as possible, then calls the up the cleaning lady, and tells her sheepishly, \"I'll give you $200 to clean this up and keep it a secret.\" She turns to him and says, \"I'll give you $500 if you tell me how you managed to shit on the wall sideways.\"\n\nEdit: ceilings don't have pans.",

Its a little long but I think it's worth it.\n\nOne day God realized heaven was getting pretty full so he went St. Peter at the gates and said, \"Hey, so it's getting kind of full in here so you're gonna need to start filtering who gets in or not by only letting in those who had the worst deaths\". Peter said ok and went to go filter the new arrivals. After explaining the new rules to everyone Peter said, \"So, if anyone thinks their death is worthy than come on up and I'll decide if you get to go in to heaven\". \n\nThe first man walk up and says,\"You're gonna have to let me in once you here how I died\" and Peter says, \"Ok, lets here it\". Well I had suspected for a while that my wife was cheating on me. So, the other day, about an hour after my wife thought I had left for work, I came back to my apartment to catch her in the act. I busted through the door and start screaming for them to come out. My wife is alone in the bedroom telling me I'm crazy and that nothing is going on, but I don't believe her. So, I start frantically searching the apartment for this guy. I search all the rooms, all the closets, everywhere! I can't find a single sign that another man had been in my house. I was about to give up when all of a sudden a heard a noise coming from my balcony outside. I go out to the balcony and there he is hanging over the edge. He is screaming that he is losing his grip but I cant control myself. I am filled with so much rage that I start pounding on his hands. I keep hitting and he keeps screaming for me to stop but I continue hitting until finally he falls. He falls all 13 stories and lands in the bushes below. I figured he would be dead for sure but somehow I see him starting to move around. I can't control my anger anymore. All I see is red. With adrenaline running through me I go over to my refrigerator, drag it to the balcony and throw it over the edge. It lands on the man and kills him. But all the pain of wife's betrayal and anger must have been to much for my body because, right then, I had a heart attack and died. Peter, blown away by the story, says, \"You're right, that is a horrible way to go. Head on in.\"\n\nThe next man walks up and Peter tells him, \"That last guy set the bar pretty high. I hope your story is pretty good.\" \"oh, it is\" says the guy. \"I'd bet it's some of the most unfortunate luck you've ever heard of\". My morning started off like every other day. I got up, had some breakfast and then went out for a morning run on my treadmill out on my penthouse balcony. One second everything is great then the next the machine is malfunctioning and speeding up like crazy. I lose control and get launched over the edge of my balcony. I figured I was going to die but managed to somehow grab on to the edge of one of the balconies below. I was hanging there for what seemed like forever, unable to pull myself up, calling for help. I thought nobody was going to come when all of a sudden a man walks onto the balcony. I was so relieved. I asked him quickly for help because I was losing my grip when all of a sudden this man goes crazy and starts hitting my hands for no reason. I can't believe my eyes! Why would someone do this to a complete stranger?! I eventually lose my grip and fall. At this point I knew it was all over and just waited for the end. Yet, somehow I landed in bushes below and survived. I figured I must be the luckiest man alive until I looked up and saw a fridge barreling down towards me and BOOM... that's all she wrote. \"...wow\" said Peter \"You were right. Go ahead and enter. You deserve it\"\n\nRight as that man was leaving another walked up. Peter turns to the man and says, \"Hey, I'm pretty sure I've heard everything today. I don't think anything could surprise me at this point but go ahead anyways.\" The man looks at Peter and says, \"Ok then... picture this; I'm naked, in a refrigerator...\" ",

Bobby is constantly stopping to say hello through check-in until the two board the plane. The two get off the plane and Jimmy follows the crowd to baggage claim and hail a taxi. He turns around and sees Bobby chatting with an airport worker and laughing hysterically.\n\n\"Hey Jimmy, can you believe it? Richard's wife just gave birth to twins! Hey Rich, tell Susan I said hello and best wishes.\"\n\nJimmy is stunned. How in the hell? He begins to tell Bobby that they need to grab a cab when Bobby stops him, grabs the attention of another worker dressed in all black. He informs Jimmy that this is an old friend, Peter, who works with the Secret Service. Their....limo.... has already been arranged for them. Jimmy is baffled.\n\n\"Still no way you know President Obama.\"\n\nBobby and Jimmy get to the limo and lo and behold, Barack steps out and gives Bobby the biggest of hugs. \"It's great to see you again, brother.\" Jimmy cannot believe it. He drills Obama with person questions about Bobby. As expected, Obama knows the answers. The trio spend the day on the town and by the end of it, Jimmy is assured the two are actual friends, yet he is not entirely believing the whole world gimmick.\n\n\"Okay, I give it to you. Today was neat. But tomorrow, we go to Tibet to meet the Dalai Lama.\"\n\nSure enough, the next day follows as the last. They're greeted off the plane by a friend of Bobby who drives them straight to His Holiness's quarters. There, they spend the afternoon chit-chatting and catching up; all the while, Jimmy's jaw is on the ground from disbelief.\n\n\"Alright man, one last test. We head off to Vatican City tomorrow. I want you to introduce me to the face of the Catholic Church - Pope Francis.\"\n\nThe third day starts off quite like the other two. Once they've arrived in the Vatican City (through a series of flights and private taxi rides from Bobby's friends), Bobby informs Jimmy that the Pope is quite busy today. He's scheduled to deliver a speech to the Papal Audience and won't have much time to entertain both guests. Bobby says that he'll make his way to the Pope (connections can get you anywhere) and when he and the Pope come out on the balcony, he'll have the Pope bless Jimmy directly.\n\nJimmy is stunned. There is absolutely no way, he's just gotta see it to believe it. He finds his place in the crowd and begins to wait. The crowds file in, full of devoted believers and eager tourists. As the time nears for the Pope to address his church, Jimmy sure enough sees Bobby by his side. His heart is racing! It isn't possible he thinks, there's is just no way.\n\nSuddenly, an obvious tourist walks behind Jimmy and taps him on the shoulder. Jimmy, not wanting to miss his blessing, quickly asks \"What ya need, buddy?\"\n\nThe tourist looks baffled and emphatically asks Jimmy... \"Hey man, who the fuck is that up there next to Bobby?!\"",

Rather, beautiful women possess a trait that is linked to beauty on chromosome 9. The trait grants beautiful women an inverted intestinal tract, such that the belly button (naval) of the beautiful women is the sole elimination medium, rather than the anus.\n\nThe waste matter passes through the inverted intestinal tract, where, as it approaches the naval, extremophilic enzymes target the waste and generate heat, thereby converting it from solid form to an invisible vapor. At the same time, additional enzymes act upon the transforming waste, such that it loses all scent.\n\nThe end result is that an invisible, odorless vapor is released through the naval and passes into the air around with absolutely no environmental or social consequences. This form of elimination is deemed most \"noble\", as it happens absolutely naturally and results in no disgusting expletives from men that otherwise would presume beautiful women poop.\n\nOn the other hand, unattractive females do not possess the linked gene on chromosome 9--as a result, they do not have inverted intestinal tracts, and such are forced to eliminate through the traditional \"pooping\" practice.\nRandom frat dude #1: Dude, that chick's so hot.\n\nRandom frat dude #2: I know bro, she definitely eliminates through HC INVITE!\n\nRandom frat dude #1: But girls don't poop!\n\nRandom frat dude #2: Dude, ya just don't understand.",

What was that?!'\n\nSo she says the words that every boyfriend on the planet dreads to hear...\n\n'You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.'\n\nShe responded to my puzzled look by saying, 'Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?'\n\nRealizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.\n\nThe very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big unnamed department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said, 'Lets get a pair for each outfit.'\n\nWe went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings. Let me tell you... she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis.\n\nI think I threw her for a loop when I said, 'That's fine, honey.' She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement.\n\nSmiling with excited anticipation, she finally said, 'I think this is all dear, let's go to the cashier.'\n\nI could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, 'No honey, I don't feel like it.'\n\nHer face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, 'WHAT?'\n\nI then said, 'Honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You're just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.'\n\nAnd just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, 'Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?'\n\nApparently I'm not having sex tonight either..\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude03",

What happened?\"\n\n\"Well, I was playing on the playground with my friend, when he asked me a question, I didn't know the answer so I asked the teacher, who got mad at me and sent me to the principal, when I told him what I asked her, he called you and told me I was suspended.\"\n\n\"So what did you ask, son?\"\n\n\"Dad, do you know what purple passion is?\"\n\nHis dad, usually a quite serious man, burst out laughing, having to pull over to avoid an accident. When he finished, he said \"Son, I think I have to divert your question to your mother, ask her when you get home.\"\n\nAt this point little Jimmy was getting pretty curious about this 'purple passion', but he was a good boy and listened to his parents, so when he got home he went straight to his mother.\n\n\"What are you doing home? Did school release early today?\"\n\n\"No mother, I got suspended.\"\n\n\"WHAT? Why did you get suspended?\"\n\n\"Well, I was playing on the playground with my friend, when he asked me a question, I didn't know the answer so I asked the teacher, who got mad at me and sent me to the principal, when I told him what I asked her, he called dad and told me I was suspended, and then dad picked me up and asked me why I was suspended, so I told him what I asked the teacher and he laughed and he told me to ask you. So mom, what is purple passion?\"\n\nHis mother had never looked so furious in his life as she did when she ordered him to his room and told him not to come out until called for. He spent a few hours in there before his older brother snuck in the window.\n\n\"Whoa, little man, what are you doing here? You skippin too?\"\n\n\"No brother, I was playing with my friend at school and he asked me a question, I didn't know the answer so I asked the teacher who got mad and sent me to the principals office, and when I asked him he called dad and suspended me, I asked dad on the ride home and he told me to ask mom, I asked mom and she grounded me. Maybe you will know big brother, what is purple passion?\"\n\nWith this a mischievous grin crept onto his brother's face.\n\n\"Oh man little bro, you got yourself in deep. The only person that can answer your question is the Sheriff.\"\n\nThe family knew the local police well, living only a block away from their combination firehouse/precinct building. So little Jimmy climbed out of the window with his brothers help and went on his own to ask the sheriff. When he arrived the sheriff was sitting at his desk, and was duly surprised at seeing the boy.\n\n\"Little Jimmy, what brings you here, on a school day no less? Are you turning yourself for truancy?\" With that the Sheriff chuckled.\n\n\"No sir, I was playing with a friend at school when he asked me a question, I didn't know the answer so I asked the teacher, she got mad and sent me to the principal, I asked him and he called my dad and suspended me, I asked my dad on the way home and he told me to ask my mom, she grounded me when I asked her, and my brother, who is a skipper, came in the window so I asked him, he told me only you would be able to answer the question.\"\n\nIntrigued, the Sheriff asked him to repeat the question.\n\n\"Mr. Sheriff, what is purple passion.\"\n\nWithout hesitation the sheriff pulled out his gun and put some lead between little Jimmy's eyes. But this was not the end of little Jimmy. The next thing he new he was staring at St. Peter at his podium in front of the pearly gates. Looking a little stunned, St. Peter spoke after referencing his book.\n\n\"Son, it says here you were shot by a sheriff, what did you do to deserve that?\"\n\n\"Well Mr. St. Peter sir, I was playing with a friend at school and he asked me a question, I didn't know the answer so I asked the teacher, the teacher got mad and sent me to the principal and the principal got mad, called my dad and suspended me. On the way home I asked my dad, he laughed and told me to ask my mom, when I got home I asked my mom and she grounded me, then my brother snuck back home and I asked him, he told me to go to the police place and ask the sheriff. I asked the sheriff and I think he shot me.\"\n\n\"What did you ask the sheriff, Jimmy?\"\n\n\"I don't want to say.\"\n\n\"Come little one, I doubt it could be that bad.\"\n\n\"Ok, Mr. St. Peter sir, what is purple passion?\"\n\nWith that the clouds opened up beneath Jimmy's feet, and he fell for what seemed like years. When he finally landed he was in hell. He wandered around for a while before running into a succubus. Very curious, she asked \"Kid, what the hell are you doing in hell?\"\n\nShocked that he was in hell, the story just fell from his lips \"I was playing with a friend when he asked me a question, I didn't know the answer so I asked the teacher, she got mad and sent me to the principal, who suspeneded me when he heard the question, so I asked my dad on the way home who laughed and told me to ask mom, my mom got mad and sent me to my room where I met my brother sneaking back in, so I asked him and he told me to go ask the sheriff so I asked the sheriff and the pig shot me, so I asked St. Peter and he sent me to hell. Ms. Demon lady, do you know what purple passion is.\" \n\nHer face went stony and she pointed at a building in the distance. \"All such questions are to be directed at Lucifer himself.\"\n\nVery scared, but wanting an answer, Jimmy made the long trek to the Devil's office. When he arrived Lucifer was in the middle of some paperwork, but looked up just a tad bit surprised.\n\n\"Little Jimmy, I wasn't expecting you before your brother, what brings you to hell?\"\n\n\"Well I was playing in with a friend at school, and he asked me a question. I didn't know the answer so I asked the teacher, the teacher got mad and sent me to the principal, the principal suspended me after I asked him so I asked my dad, my dad laughed and told me to ask my mother, when I asked mom she grounded me, and my brother snuck into the room so I asked him as well, but he told me the only person allowed to answer the question was the Sheriff, so went to the police building and asked him, but he shot me, then I was in heaven and St. Peter asked me why I died, and when I asked him the question he sent me to hell, where I met a demon lady who, when asked, told me to ask you. So please, please, please Mr. Devil sir, can you tell me what purple passion is?\"\n\nLucifer starts to laugh, but calms down quickly. \"Little Jimmy, purple passion is a five minute joke with no other purpose than to waste your time.\"\n\nTL;DR: You beat the system, congrats.",

In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to be the next port of call for the great ship after its stop in New York. This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico but as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York.\n\nThe ship hit an iceberg and sank and the cargo was forever lost. The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of Mourning which they still observe to this day. The National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5th and is known, of course as Sinko de Mayo.",

His dad replies that he can't have a real parrot, but searches all around and eventually finds a plastic parrot toy. The boy's mother assures him that it will all be ok and they sit down with their son to open his presents. The father worriedly hands the plastic parrot to his son but the boy immediately loves his gift and will not stop playing with it. That Christmas, the boy asks for another plastic parrot to play with, so his dad goes back to the store and gets another. The boy is overjoyed and can't stop playing with his parrots. The next year he asks again for a plastic parrot, and his dad is surprised that he is still so interested in parrots, but complies. He begins to amass more and more toy parrots. On his sixth birthday his parents throw him a parrot themed party. By this point he has started school and some of the kids in his class come to the party.\n'Your kid really does like parrots' some of the parents note when they are dropping their children off at the party.\nThe boy's parents shrug it off, thinking it is just a phase. But year after year, the boy keeps asking for plastic parrots for his birthday, and his entire room is full of them, along with the parrot themed wallpaper and duvet cover. By his eighth birthday he has around 30 plastic parrots, this later rises to 50 by the time he is 10. He is finding it increasingly hard to make friends at school, preferring to stay home and play with his parrots instead of hanging out with humans. At the age of 13 his parents take him to a psychiatrist to ask if there is anything wrong, but he is completely normal. He goes to another psychiatrist, but is told the same.\n'He just really likes parrots'.\nBy the age of 14 the situation is starting to take its toll on the family. The house becomes filled with plastic parrots and his mother cannot handle it anymore. She gets into arguments with the father and eventually walks out on him and the boy. This event makes parrot boy even more depressed and so by his 15th birthday, even though his parents no longer give him plastic parrots directly, he spends all his birthday money on parrots. \nBy this point the dad is furious. He asks his son, 'Why are you so obsessed with these plastic parrots?' but his son simply blanks him and walks away. Every time he brings it up in conversation, he changes the subject.\nWhen the boy turns 16 his dad tells him he needs to get a job, because he cannot keep giving him money for plastic parrots. He becomes a waiter in a local restaurant, and things start to look up.\nHe is actually leaving his bedroom to socialise rather than play with parrots, he even meets a girl at work and eventually she becomes his girlfriend. He gives some of his plastic parrots to a charity that gives toys to disadvantaged children.\nBut things come crashing down when him and his girlfriend split up. Just one time, he asks her to dress up as a parrot for him and she doesn't comply, storming out of the house calling him a freak. This makes his plastic parrot addiction worse, he buys more and more, begins hoarding them, hiding them from his dad. But one day his dad finds a bunch under the bed.\nInstead of screaming at the son, his dad breaks down and cries.\n'Is there anything I can do to make it stop? Is there anything in the world you want more than plastic parrots?' the dad begs with his son.\n'Well, there is one thing,' he replies. 'I still can't drive, and I would really like a car.'\nThe dad runs off, booking his son a driving instructor immediately. After a few months of lessons the boy is really getting the hang of driving. His dad is so proud. The plastic parrots have once again been sold off or given away and it seems the son is cured. He takes his driving test and passes the first time. He is so pleased and his dad so proud of him that he takes him to a garage and asks him to pick out a car. Whichever car, no matter how expensive, if it will stop the parrots. The boy is not too fussy, he is happy with a ford focus. The next day he drives off in his new car, but his dad receives a phone call. His son has been in an accident and crashed. He rushes to the hospital but it soon becomes clear that his son has been badly hurt.\n'His injuries are serious but he is stable, and he will probably pull through,' his dad is told.\nHis dad runs into the room to speak with his son, terrified after what has happened.\n'Son, I love you so much. But please tell me, just incase anything like this ever happens again, but worse. The only thing I want to ask you and have ever wanted to ask you in my entire life, is why are you so obsessed with the parrots?'\nHe looks at his son, who starts to cry.\n'Dad I love you. And I am so sorry I kept it from you,' his son replies. He knows that it is time for the truth. 'The real reason that I'm so obsessed with plastic parrots is'..........\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n and then he died.\n",

Answer to your letters article 11 I was working on the work site alone that day. I, by profession build roofs on buildings and on that it was a 7 floor building. When I finished my work I had about 275kg of roof buildings materials over. Of course the building didn't have an elevator and I didn't want to carry it all down by the stairs. We had a small crane with a roll attached to the building so I thought I'll just get them down via crane. I went upstairs and loaded the lifting bay attached to the crane. The wire was firmly attached to the ground. So I went downstairs and released the wire, but like I answered to you before my weight at the time was about 75kg. So when I released the wire I was shocked when the ground was disappearing from under my feet. I was so shocked that I didn't release to let go of the wire. About on the third floor up I met with the loading bay loaded with excess materials. No need to tell you that this is where I got the fracture to the scull and injury to the shoulder. Because I got my reaction back and didn't want to fall from high I kept holding on until the crane roll jammed my fingers between the wire. At the same time the loading bay hit the ground and all the materials came off it and were scattered all around. The loading bay was just about 25kg without the building materials so I was coming down. That is where I got my leg broken and all the wounds on my legs while meeting the loading bay about on the third floor down again. Luckily it slowed me down enough, so when I landed on the building materials I only broke three of my spinal cords. Then I let go of the wire and the last thing I remember is the loading bay coming down towards me.\n\nSincerely\n\nJohn Smith\n",

We\u2019ve really enjoyed these last few days \nand have really bonded. We found out we both like snacks and drinks after a hard day, watching old UFC \nfights and staying up late watching animal planet. Dolly really likes the animal ghost stories, but Kent \ndoesn\u2019t think she really believes all of them.  Our favorite game is called \u201cWhere\u2019s Larry? Kent goes first. \n\nHe asks Dolly \u2018Where\u2019s Larry?\u201d  \u201cWhere\u2019s Larry? \u201c, Dolly will just look at Kent, like he\u2019s speaking French \nor something. But, when Kent says\u2019s \u2018Where\u2019s Susan? \u201cWhere\u2019s Susan?\u201d Dolly will tilt her head and then  \nrun over to the door where you last went out. She stares at the door for a few seconds and then turns \nback to look at Kent, with a slightly annoyed and somewhat sad expression. Like she\u2019s thinking, \u201cI won\u2019t \nfall for that one again\u201d, but she does.   We also have invented a few other games, Like \u201cWhere\u2019s the \ngiant cat hiding?\u201d, \u201cWho cut the cheese?\u201d \u201cFind your Food\u201d and\u201d Who\u2019s in charge?\u201d But our favorite is \nstill \u2018Where\u2019s Larry?\u201d We have learned that Kent needs to remind Dolly, that after she goes number two, \nit is not ok to use the new bedroom carpet to clean one\u2019s self. Kent asks himself what Mark would do? \nBut then, Kent gives Dolly some more water, and Kent has another Jack and coke until he passes out. \n\nDolly is also learning personal boundaries, like, don\u2019t always follow Kent into the bathroom and when \nthe door is closed, she doesn\u2019t always have to sit at rapt attention waiting at the door.  Kent can tell,  \nthat Dolly thinks Kent may disappear, like you guys did and not come back.  Kent  shows photos of  both \nof you to Dolly, so she won\u2019t forget what you look like, except she still confuses Larry\u2019s photo with  \npictures of other  relative\u2019s and magazine photos. \n\nOne time , when I said, \u201cFind Larry\u2019? she put her paw on a photo of Dick Cheney. Kent believes Dolly just has a strange sense of humor, or is just messing with him. We are both collaborating on writing a  script for a movie, called \u201cThe last  Lhasa Apso that didn\u2019t listen \u201d it\u2019s going pretty well, except now, Dolly doesn\u2019t like the title . Well, we have to run. No, literally we have to run, Kent tried to tell Dolly, not to mix milk bones with mix nuts, but again,  she  wouldn\u2019t listen.\n\nSincerely, Dolly and Kent.",

The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.\n\n\nThe elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.\n\n\nTwenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.\n\n\nRemembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.\n\n\nProbably wasn't the same fucking elephant",

Suddenly the light bulb burns out over their head and maintenance guy comes and changes the light bulb.

After the maintenance guy leaves he says looking at the burned out light bulb: \"You do know guys that if you put a light bulb in your mouth so that socket is outwards you are not capable getting it out.\" Physicians disagree and say: \"If it goes in, it also can come out. It is common sense.\"\n\nOne of the physicians puts then the burned out light bulb in the mouth socket outwards and after that he can't get it out (proved scientific fact now). So they order a taxi and go to the hospital.\n\nTaxi driver is of course looking at guy with the WTF face but takes them too the hospital. Reception nurse of course tries not to laugh after hearing the story from the two guys who could speak and she pointed to the surgeons room.\n\n\nSurgeon listened the story and is pleasant and experienced, so he just presses three nerves on the neck so the mouth opens up even wider and he gets the bulb out. Doctor says that his jaw movement will be back in 40 min, until then his jaw will be wide open and laughs at the three idiots who put light bulbs in their mouth in the middle of the night.\n\nGuys take their bulb and get back to the taxi. The driver asked what it was all about. They explain but the taxi driver didn't believe them, the mathematician even takes out the light bulb. Next thing they were driving back to the hospital with the taxi driver having a light bulb in his mouth and socket hanging out. Reception nurse was literally rolling on the floor and laughing.\n\nDoctor removes the light bulb from the driver mouth and crushes it and says: \"Otherwise you idiots will be coming here all night!\"\n\nBecause the taxi driver also had paralyzed jaw and jaw wide open, he couldn't drive properly and the police pulled them over. Police then asked the driver that where the hell are you driving these three.\n\nSince the driver could not talk the mathematician explained what had happened. Police of course didn't believe them and asked them to follow him and went to check from the police station their background and check out the story. Few minutes later the police enters the taxi and with a light bulb in his mouth, socket hanging out and waving like hell to go the hospital.\n\nAs they pull up and go to the reception nurse, there was hard time reviving her after that. So they go straight to the surgeons door and knock.\n\nSurgeon opens the door, jaw wide open.\n\nEDIT: Little bit of spelling.",

There's an ice cream shop just across the street if you want to wait there and cool off.\"\n\nSo the penguin waddles over to the ice cream shop, and orders an outlandishly large dish of ice cream. Now we musn't forget, penguins don't have fingers, so a spoon would be an impossibility. He however, did not let this minor setback stop him (I mean come on, he can *drive* after all), and just went apeshit on this bowl of ice cream. By the time he was done, he was thoroughly chilled, and thoroughly covered in melted ice cream. He figured enough time had passed, and he headed over to the mechanic's shop to see if his car was done. \n\n\"Hey Mr. mechanic, what's the damage?\"\n\n\"Well Mr. Penguin, it looks like you just blew a seal.\"",

His mom is on the phone hysterically crying.  \"You won't believe what your son said to me....I don't know what we are going to do...come home right now please!\"\n\nSilence fills the air.  Timmy lays on his bed staring at the ceiling.  Then the garage door opens and he knows that his father his home.  He hears the clunking of his fathers footsteps on the stairs and begins to feel tense.\n\n\"Son, why are you home from school?\" he asks, a soft tone fills the air.  Timmy feels a bit calmer.\n\n\"I keep telling people what I said, and just telling them gets me in trouble.  I don't know what is so bad about it!\" Timmy says with tears filling his eyes.\n\n\"What did you say?\" Timmy's dad asks.\n\n\"I don't want to say.\"\n\nYou can tell me, not punishment for telling me.\"\n\n\"That I saw a purple butterfly.\"\n\nHis fathers face goes red, and a scowl comes across his face.  He grabs a backpack and puts a handful of clothes in it.\n\n\"Your gone,\" his father screams.  \"We can't have you living hear anymore.\"\n\nTimmy grabs the backpack and starts running again.  He decides to go to his grandmothers house because she's always been so good to him.  She always made him feel special and had never once got mad at him.\n\nAfter about an hour of walking he manages to get there.  He knocks on the door and tries to fake a smile.  He hears the shuffling of her feet and the click of the lock.  She opens it and greets him with a hug.\n\n\"What are you doing here during school, Timmy?\"  she says with a mild look of confusion on her face.\n\n\"I just got kicked out of home...\" Timmy says sadly, staring at the floor.\n\n\"Well what did you do?\"\n\n\"I just said something I shouldn't have.  I don't even know what it means.\"\n\n\"What was it Timmy? You can tell me about it and then we'll get you a cookie.  You can stay here until your parents get a bit calmer.\"\n\n\"I'd rather not say,\" Timmy says.\n\n\"Cookie first then,\" Grandma answers.\n\nTimmy takes a bite of his cookie and feels safe.  His grandma smiles from across the table. \n\n\"Now what was it Timmy?\"  she asks.\n\n\"I just said I didn't know what purple butterflies were.\"\n\n\"OUT!\" she yells.\n\nTimmy knew the drill and ran out in tears again.\n\nHe stumbles around for awhile trying to find a place to sit.  He ends up downtown and sees a homeless man.  *maybe he will tell me!* Timmy thinks.\n\n\"Can you help me?\" Timmy asks as he approaches the homeless man.\n\n\"Sure kid,\" he says in a gruff tone.\n\n\"What does purple butterfly mean?\"\n\n\"Don't want to ask that kid.  Get out of here before I beat your face myself!\"\n\n\"Thank you anyways,\" Timmy sighs and walks away.\n\nHe gets further downtown and sees that the sun is setting.  He cries to himself now because the streets are beginning to empty a bit.  He watches a police car drive by.  Then it drives by again a few minutes later.  Then again later, but this time it stops.  \n\n\"You okay kid?\" the officer says as he approaches.  \n\n\"I have nowhere to go,\" Timmy says.  \"I got kicked out.\"\n\n\"Slow down, whats your name?\" the officer asks.\n\n\"Timmy.\"\n\n\"Now Timmy, what happened? You got kicked out?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.  I got kicked out of school, my parents, and my grandmas.\"\n\n\"Did you do something?\"\n\n\"I just said something.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" the cop asks.\n\n\"I'd rather not say, it only gets me in trouble.\"\n\n\"We will need to know.  You won't get in trouble, it will just help our investigation.\"\n\n\"I just said I saw a purple butterfly!\" Timmy cries.\n\n\"Oh..\" the cop says.  He takes out his handcuffs.  \n\nTimmy begins running.  He sees an alleyway on the other side of the street.  The officer grabs his arm, but he manages to yank it away.  He leaps off the curb and at that moment a truck smashes into him.\n\nThe moral of the story is to look both ways before you cross the street.",

He somehow befriended the gal and dated her for a few times and one day he brought her home where both of them sat on the couch. He then stood up and told her he wanted to show her something and unzipped his pants and removed his penis and asked the gilr,\"do you know what this is?\"\n\nThe girl giggled a lot like a young teen and replied.\"thats a tadpole!\"\n\nThe man was surprised at the reply and asked.\"are you sure this is a tadpole\"\n\nThe giggled more and said.\"yes i am sure this is a tadpole\"\n\nThe man was happy to hear that and came to conclusion this girl had to be an innocent virgin and immediately asked to marry her and she agreed.\n\nAfter marriage it was the first time they both were in bed and so he undressed himself naked and told her,\"Darling tonight I am going into initiate you into the beautiful world of sex and teach you all I know and to star with this thing you see here is called a penis\"\n\nThe girl replied casually.\"yeah i know thats a penis, you think I am stupid or something\"\n\nThe man who was shocked by now asked.\"but the other day you thought this was a tadpole\"\n\nThe girl laughed and replied.\"well i had seen lots of pythons, bandicoots, frogs but never a tadpole\"",

It's white with a streaked, bloody hand-print, ala Psycho.\n\nKey Fact 2) If you're standing in the right spot at the right time of night, you can hear the neighbors fighting through the vent in the bathroom floor.\n\nWell, tonight the neighbors were fighting rather loudly, and it sounded like it was getting physical, so I called the cops. We live on the second story, so I told the dispatcher to send them to the laundromat on the corner, and I'd meet them down there.\n\nSo I throw on my jacket and head down to the corner. About fifteen minutes later, two cops pull up and greet me. I explain the situation: I can hear the neighbors fighting, and it sounds like it might have gotten violent, but I don't know where these people are relative to us. Would the officers like to come up and give it a listen, from within our bathroom?\n\nYou can guess where this is going.\n\nThey agreed. So we walked down the street, and up our front stoop, and I unlock the front door, and we tromp up the stairs toward the apartment. I warn them, \"Watch your step, we've got two cats,\" because that's the only thing that springs to mind as being worthy of a warning.\n\nI open the door, and both cops come in. One hangs out near the entrance, while the other follows me into the bathroom.\n\nI flick the lights on. \"Okay,\" I start, \"so I can hear them through the vent here--\"\n\nAnd then the cop spots a bloody handprint in the mirror, and his eyes go huge, and he's like, \"Woah, woah, woah,\" and steps back for a second and gives the other guy this look like DUDE GAME FACE, SHIT'S ABOUT TO GO DOWN.\n\nWe had a good laugh about it later, but it was a very tense five seconds -- during which two heavily-armed men standing in my living-room briefly believed that I was some kind of psychotic Batman villain leading them into a second-story bathroom-of-horror funhouse murder surprise.\n\nThe moral of the story is: if your significant other has a dark sense of humor, don't let them pick the decorations for your home.

Well....when he's there. You see, this guy makes a lot of money, but has to travel a lot for work. So, naturally, they start to miss each other, and the wife confesses that she misses sex a lot. The husband, being open minded and chill about the whole thing, tells her he has no problems with her going to get masturbatory aids from a sex shop. She's a bit nervous, but after some thinking, she decides to give it a go.\n\nThe next day, she's in a local sex shop in her town, and she's looking around. She's never really had any experience with this kind of thing, so she's wandering around looking at things, before she hears \"pssp....\" behind her. She ignores it. \"Pssp....you...\" She turns around and see's an old lady standing beside a door in the back of the shop. So she walks up to the old lady, and the strange elder says \"Come with me, I know what you need for when your husband is on another trip...\" Amazed, the young wife follows the old woman into the back room, only to see a single table with a box on it. The old woman hands the box over and beckons her to open it. Nervously, the young lady opens it, to see a dusty dildo. \"Ma'am...thank you, but I think I just want to buy one from out there..\" she said, looking at the strange gift. The old woman laughs and says \"Oh young lady, that's no ordinary dildo. This one, you see, is magical. If you say 'Magic dildo, my' followed by where you want it, it will pleasure you until you tell it to stop. There's nothing like it. Take it home, try it out. I promise you'll love it...\" Scared, but curious, the young lady thanks the old woman and leaves.\n\nThe young woman sits down on her bed when she gets home and looks at the closed box. She undresses, gets under the covers, and quietly says \"....Magic dildo...my vagina..?\" Amazingly, the box bursts open, the dildo flies out, and goes right into her just as she wants it to, and she gets the most amazing orgasm she's ever had. \"MAGIC DILDO, STOP!\" she cries in ecstasy, and it does, going back into the box. \n\nNaturally, she becomes addicted. She uses it every night that her husband is gone. \"Magic dildo, my vagina\" every night for weeks. But every night, the dildo takes a little longer to actually stop and go back into the box. Until, one night, she's on the couch, squirming in pleasure, until she climaxes and says \"Magic dildo...stop.\" It doesn't. \"Magic dildo....stop.\" It keeps going inside her. \"MAGIC DILDO, STOP!\" It just keeps going as if she said nothing. Terrified, she awkwardly hobbles to her car after she throws on a dress, and speeds down the highway to get to the sex shop. She arrives, banging on the door. The old woman comes over and opens the door. \"THIS THING WON'T STOP, IT HURTS SO BAD!\" she says. \"Oh sweetheart...Didn't I tell you? Use it too much, and it'll never stop. It needs to find a new owner, or it'll never stop again.\" Mortified, the young woman gets back into the car, sobbing, speeding to the hospital. Ten minutes into the drive, she see's police lights behind her. She stops the car and the officer approaches the window. He leans over and says \"Ma'am, do you know you were going over 100 miles per hour...?\" The woman, desperate, cries out \"Sir, I know you won't believe me at first, but there is a magic dildo in me and it won't stop going!

The following day the teacher asks for the first volunteer to tell their story. \n\nLittle Suzy raises her hand.  \"My dad owns a farm and every Sunday we load the chicken eggs on the truck and drive into town to sell them at the market.  Well, one Sunday we hit a big bump and all the eggs flew out of the basket and onto the road.\" \n\nWhen the teacher asked for the moral of the story, Suzy replied, \"Don't keep all your eggs in one basket.\" \n\nLittle Lucy went next.  \"My dad owns a farm too.  Every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator.  Last weekend only eight of the 12 eggs hatched.\"; \n\nAgain, the teacher asked for the moral of the story. Lucy replied, \"Don't count your chickens before they hatch.\" \n\nNext up was little Johnny.  \"My uncle Ted fought in the Vietnam war, and his plane was shot down over enemy territory.  He jumped out before it crashed but could only take a case of beer, a machine gun and a machete.  On the way down, he drank the case of beer.  Then he landed right in the middle of 100 Vietnamese soldiers.  He shot 70 with his machine gun, but then he ran out of bullets!  So he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more.  Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.\" \n\nThe teacher looked a little shocked.  After clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story. \"Well,\" Johnny replied, \"Don't fuck with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking.\"",

There he gave an idea of how he wanted his commercial \"I want it to be epic and persuasive, everyone should buy my nails\", he was said to not worry and come back in a week, and the commercial would be made. He came back a week later and he watched his commercial preview.\n\nThe scene was grim and dark, unsettling holy music was filling the air and Bob could see a ghastly figure moaning and suffering in the distance. The camera slowly got closer to the mysterious figure. It was Jesus at the cross, having his final moments and making pain noises. Then, the commercial tag came in \"Bob's Nails. Never fails.\"\n\nBob was visibly angry. \"This is outrageous! Preposterous! You will get me in so much trouble if this runs on the TV\". The commercial editor and director had no idea what was wrong with it, but fearing his client would refuse to pay, he asked for a second chance. Bob had to think for a moment, but thinking that it possibly couldn't be worse, agreed. He was there a week later and a new commercial was waiting for him.\n\nThe scene this time was a vibrant read and you could see a small field, tension was rising and the music was sharp and nerve wrecking. Suddenly, a man in poor shape came running through the field, wearing teared clothes and had scratches and cuts dripping blood all over his body. Not that far behind him, a huge army of roman soldiers were rushing hot on his trail. We see the man and the soldiers passing the camera and two soldiers are left behind, gasping for breath. \n\nOne looks at the other and slaps his arm.\n\n\"I told you we should have used Bob's Nails.\"\n\n",

He looked at the receptionist and wagged his tail, then walked over to the sign, looked at it, whined and pawed the air. The receptionist called the office manager. He was surprised, to say the least to see a canine applicant. However, the dog looked determined, so he led him into the office. \n\nInside, the dog jumped up on a chair and stared at the manager expectantly. The manager said, \"I can't hire you. The sign says you must be able to type.\" The dog jumped down, went to the typewriter and proceeded to quickly type a perfect business letter. He took out the page and trotted over to the manager, gave it to him, then jumped back up on the chair. \n\nThe manager was stunned, but told the dog, \"That was fantastic, but I'm sorry. The sign clearly says that whoever I hire has to be good with a computer.\" \n\nThe dog jumped down again, went to the computer and proceeded to demonstrate his expertise with various programs, produced a sample spreadsheet and database, then presented them to the manager. \n\nThe manager was dumbfounded! He said to the dog, \"Hey, I realize that you are a very intelligent applicant and have fantastic talent, but you're a dog -- no way could I hire you.\" \n\nThe dog jumped down and went to the sign in the window and pointed his paw at the words, \"Equal Opportunity Employer.\" \n\nThe exasperated manager said, \"Yes, I know what the sign says.

The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.\n\nThe elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.\n\nTwenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.\n\nRemembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. \n\nHe walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.\n\nProbably wasn't the same fucking elephant.\n\n",

Missing a crucial interchange, he runs the trains of the tracks and destroys all the cargo, wrecks the train, and kills four people in the process.\n\nAfter months of trials, lawsuits, and court dates, he receives a death row sentence.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nMonths pass and finally the week of his execution arises. With three days left to live, an Holding Officer comes to his cell and walks him through the process that will occur in the upcoming days.\n\nTonight you will receive 1 of your last 3 meals. You may ask for whatever food you like and we will accommodate to the best of our abilities. On the third day, before your last meal, the chaplain will come in to give you your final blessing if you desire. You will eat. Then I will come take you to the chair.\n\nThe Holding Officer leaves a notepad and pen for the man to write down his meals...\n\nOne the first day, he is brought a banana and a glass of water per his request. The office leaves a tray with the items at the foot of his cell, but gives the man a perplexed look before leaving.\n\nThe man eats the banana and drinks the water, but takes the peal and stores it under his mattress.\n\nThe second day comes and once again the office brings his order, this time with two bananas instead of one. Before leaving though, he stops to ask the man of his odd requests.\n\nYou can have any food your heart desires, and yet yesterday all you ask for was a banana, and today the same thing?? Would you not prefer a seasoned steak, or gourmet pizza? Or maybe a fancy desert like a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e??\n\nThe man thought for a moment before speaking. Without looking up from the tray of food, and barely above a murmor, spoke gently to the officer, If it concerns you that much to mention it, perhaps you could add an item to my order tomorrow\n\nThe officer's ears perked up in anticipation of the request.\n\nI'd like an ice cream cone added to my order tomorrow. With chocolate sprinkles on top, NOT multi-colored.\n\nThe officer's look of intrigue disappeared off his face, but he acknowledged the mans' request and said he would make it so.\n\nThe third day arrives. The man sitting cross-legged in the middle of the cell waits for the officer to arrive. In one corner of his cell sits an untouched cup of water from the previous day, under his mattress two banana peels rest, with the third lodged between his thighs.\n\nOfficer shows up. Sets down the tray, proud of himself for having found chocolate sprinkles despite the kitchen's only confetti colored ones, and informs the man he'll be back in half an hour to take him to his end.\n\nFor his last meal he eats the entire banana. Peel and all. He drinks the cup of water but not the one on his tray. Taking it from the corner of the room, he pours the entire cup into his throat with his held tilted back. In one swallow it's gone.\n\nNext, he takes the new cup of water. Individually, he sticks every single one of his fingers into the cup. With wet tips, he runs his hands through his hair for several minutes. Repeating this process until all the water in the cup is gone.\n\nAt last, he reaches his single scoop of ice cream. Chocolate sprinkles, just like he asked. A small smile crosses his face.\n\nThen, with the grace and precision of a watch maker, he picks off every one. Every. Single. Sprinkle.\n\nBy the time all the sprinkles are removed, and stashed secretly into the banana peels under the mattress, his clock reads 2-minutes till showtime.\n\nWith his last remaining minutes he enjoys his ice cream.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nThe helmet is strapped.\n\nThe belts are tied tight.\n\nThe man's moment of judgement has finally come.\n\nThe officer does the inspection himself, insuring everything is in order. A medic stands by ready to flip the switch. In a matter of seconds, hundreds of thousands of volts will be passing through the man's body, ending his sinful life.\n\nThe officer places his right hand on the switch. His touch lighter for some reason than all the times in the past. He asks if the man has any last words.\n\nBut the man says nothing. Instead, he shakes his head from side to side, with eyebrows raised in a show of complacency. His thighs however, squeeze tight to the banana peel between his legs.\n\nThe Officer lets out a sigh, and begins his count.\n\n3.\n\n2.\n\n1.\n\nThe switch is flipped. The lights flicker. And a loud buzz is heard.\n\nBut nothing happens.\n\nNow in the state where they reside, if any attempt past two does not successfully end a prisoner's life, he is returned to his cell and given a new term of life sentence over execution.\n\nFull well knowing this is the case, the officer goes to check his connections. Every thing seems in order.\n\nHe returns to the switch\n\n3.\n\n2.\n\n1.\n\nThe switch is flipped. The lights flicker. And a loud buzz is heard.\n\nStill nothing.\n\nNow a man in a suit has entered the room. He whispers something to the medic. The officer double and triple checks all the connections.\n\nThe man sits calmly. A content look rests upon his face.\n\nThe final attempt. Tensions high in the room. Everyone's breath is held.\n\n3.\n\n2.\n\n1.\n\nThe switch is flipped. The lights flicker. And a loud buzz is heard.\n\nNothing.\n\nPerplexed. The officer run his hand through his hair. He looks at the man sitting in the death chair, unharmed. Now a giant smile radiates from ear to ear.\n\nThe officer shouts out the man\n\nI DON'T UNDERSTAND! HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE!? HOW ARE YOU NOT DEAD\n\nThe man smile fades, he raises one eyebrow, shrugs and mutters--\n\nI don't know. I guess I'm a bad conductor.",

With each slap of his forehead, his member grows until it's quite impressivly long.\n'Well,' she says, 'that's quite impressive but it is still narrow.' 'No problem,' he says and starts pulling his ears. With each pull, his member grows wider and wider until the entire measurement is extremely exciting to the woman. 'WOW!' she exclaims, as they fell into bed and made mad passionate love.\n\nThe next day the couples rejoin their partners and go their separate ways. As they walked along, Charlie asks, 'Well was it any good?' 'I hate to say it,' says Maureen, 'but it was wonderful. How about you?'\n'It was horrible,'he replies.

Conversation wasn't flowing, so I suggested that we go somewhere quiet so we could talk. He agreed, but he didn't say much.\n\n \nI asked him what was wrong; He said, 'Nothing.' I asked him if it was my fault that he was upset. He said he wasn't upset, that it had nothing to do with me, and not to worry about it.\nOn the way home, I told him that I loved him. He smiled slightly, and kept driving. I can't explain his behavior.

The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.\n\nThe elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.\n\nTwenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.\n\nRemembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.\n\nProbably wasn't the same fucking elephant.\n",

Then you buy about 50 barrels and put them on the ship.  You tell the crew that the team that fills the most barrels wins a bag of gold.\" \n\n\"Well that's a great way to keep the ship clean, but then I'm out a bag of gold every trip!\" \n\n\"Aha,\" replied the other captain.  \"After you get back to port, take all the barrels together and sell them to the wax factory to make into candles.  You make a tidy profit every time.\" \n\nThe captain pondered this and the next day, he took his friend's advice and divided the crew, bought a bunch of barrels, and set off to sea.  Before long, the crew took to the new system and began filling barrel after barrel.\n\nWhen they finally reached port, the captain sold the barrels for a huge profit.  \"This is great,\" thought the captain, \"before long, I'll be able to buy a new boat!\" \n\nThis went on, voyage after voyage.  Then one day, the ship happened back to that very first port.  Coming down the gangplank, the captain was surprised to see the marshal waiting for him.

I mean I love eels but most people just kind of glance at them on the way to the stingrays. Today there were so many people there I couldn't even see the tank. I managed to push myself to the front, accidentally shoving a toddler, and saw what all the fuss was about. \n\nThere they were, all swimming about, hidingin crevices, doing what eels do best. Except one. I couldn't actually believe it but right in the middle of the tank there was an eel. Biggest eel in there. And it was singing. Clear as day it was singing. I don't know how we were all hearing it through the glass and the water but we could see its mouth moving perfectly with the words. It even hummed some of the music at one point so I know it wasn't a trick. It only sang the one song though, this old love song that I can't remember the name of. It's really popular though,used in loads of movies, especially ones about Italy. \n\nI couldn't believe it, I'd never seen an eel do this before. I knew so much about eels and yet I'd never heard of this kind before. I managed to spot an employee on the other side of the room and struggled my way over. I somehow got his attention over the noise of all the people and the singing eel. \n\n\"How the hell does an eel know that song? How is it able to sing?

He had spent four years (both seniors) staring at her and not once had enough courage to talk to her. Jennifer was quite simply the exact opposite of Simon. She was popular, beautiful, smart, and overall just a fantastic human being. She was a cheer leader, student body president, and captain of the debate team. Jennifer was the whole package (plus she pays her taxes).\n\nSimon decides that he is going to ask Jennifer to the prom. Simon knows that to have a chance of going to prom with Jennifer he is going to have to do it in a spectacular way. So, Simon bought a kitten. Jennifer has a reputation of being a cat lover, FYE. He walked up to Jennifer and said, \"It would be PURRTY awesome if you went to prom with me\". Jennifer being the fantastic human being decided to make Simon's life by saying yes to his prom proposal. \n\nSimon now has to make sure everything is perfect for prom. So, the first thing that he needs to do is rent a tuxedo. He goes to Men\u2019s Warehouse to pick out his tux and there is what seems like his entire school there doing the same thing. Simon has to wait in a two hour line before he gets fitted. Simon is thinking that two hours is nothing for getting to go to prom with Jennifer.\n\nSimon wants to go all out for Jennifer and decides to rent limo. He gets to the limo rental store and again there is a crazy line to rent limos. Simon thinks whatever Jennifer is worth it. So he waits in line and rents nicest limo they have.\n\nProm is approaching so now Simon has to get Jennifer a corsage. He gets there and once again half of his school is there doing the same thing. Three hours pass and finally he gets the perfect corsage of roses and baby's breath to match her dress. \n\nThe big day arrives. Simon looks handsome in his tux and Jennifer stunning in her gown. He puts the corsage on around her wrist and they get into their limo. \n\nThey arrive to Prom and everything is going swimmingly. They do a little dancing before deciding to go over to take prom pictures. There is a massive line for pictures, but they wait anyways because they want this night immortalized forever. \n\nAfter a little bit more of dancing they decide to take a break. Jennifer feeling parched asks Simon he wouldn't mind getting them some punch. Simon feeling chivalrous obliges.

Even Ferdinand Feghoot could be outpunned on occasion \u2013 but he always rose to the challenge.\n\n\nHe conducted a crew of new S.A.R.H. (Society for the Aesthetic Rearrangement of History) recruits \u2013 all from late twentieth-century Terra \u2013 on a training study of Carter\u2019s World, a newly established agricultural colony attempting to support itself by the export of edible nuts. Barely into their second generation, and having yet to show a profit, the colonists were technologically backward. Nevertheless, they showed a surprising ingenuity in the use of their few advantages. It was this resourcefulness that Feghoot was demonstrating to his rookies.\n\n\u201cLook at the perfection with which these streets are graded\u201d, exclaimed one student. \u201cEarth-moving machinery on this scale is strictly high technology stuff. How can they do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cA new alleyway is being constructed, nearby\u201d, said Feghoot. \u201cLet us walk that way while I explain.\u201d As they strolled, he told his students that countless centuries before, the Carter\u2019s World system had been inhabited by a now-vanished race of giants. This very planet had served them for a nursery, and among the many artifacts they had left were thousands of childrens blocks, immense and precision-cut. You simply jack one up onto logs, bring it where you want it, put collapsible jacks underneath, snake out the logs, spread soil more or less evenly beneath, and collapse the jacks.\n\n\u201cI see\u201d, said the student. \u201cIt\u2019s not graded road at all; its a simple hammered-earth base.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Feghoot went on smoothly. \u201cYou just hit the road jack and don\u2019t come back no mo.\u201d\n\nHis students registered dismay and anguish.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that right, old-timer?,\u201d Feghoot demanded of an ancient Carterian standing by the mouth of the newly completed alley they had just reached.\n\n\u201cAhm afraid not, suh\u201d, said the senior citizen, and the students giggled at Feghoots discomfiture. \u201cOh, we used to do it that way, but it was far too much trouble. It\u2019s the soil heah. You see, the very same soil which produced our famous cashews is so high in clay content that a child could roll out a road of it. Then, we simply use a system of lenses to bake it into hardness. Ahve just completed this alley mahself, and ahm just a retired professor of Sports History, much too old and feeble to handle hydraulic jacks.\n\n\u201cSo you see,\u201d he finished, eyes twinkling, \u201cMah hammered alley is really cashews clay.\u201d\n\nHowls of agony rose from the students, but Feghoot never hesitated. \u201cAnd he\u201d, he said, turning to his students, \u201cis clearly the gradist.\u201d",

The boy became a bit miffed and said, \"I'll show you.\"\n\nThe boy went for a walk in the woods and happened across a big rock next to a pond. Now, be reminded that in this point in his life, he had no girlfriend to have a child with, but he was determined. He pulled down his pants and went to town. When he was done, he boomed on the rock next to the pond, pulled up his pants and he went home. \n\nThe next day, the boy came back to the pond, searching for his results. Surely enough, there sat a humongous bull frog on the rock staring right at him. \n\nThe boy got excited, ran over and said, \"you're an ugly little bastard, but you're mine and I love you.\" ",

Unfortunately, the child is home-schooled, too, so he has no chance of making friends at school. The child's parents decide that they should get him into comics in hopes that he might realize that some of the greatest heroes didn't have friends as a child, either. The child, at the age of 6, walks into the shop. He looks around and sees a Superman comic. Smiling, the boy begs his father for the comic. He gets the comic, and they walk home happily with the comic. When they get home, the boy begins to read the comic.\n\nAs the boy goes into his teens, he has many comics, action figures, and superhero movies. Cups and plates are strewed all over the floor, since the teenager is too immersed in his comics to return them to the kitchen. One day, the mother of the boy walks in his room, and he throws a Hulk action figure at her, screaming, \"HULK SMASH THOSE WHO NO KNOCK!\" The mother, shocked by the action figure, accidentally drops a china plate she was cleaning with a wash cloth. The plate falls onto the figure, snapping off it's head as they hit the floor. The teenager starts shouting insults at the mother, and eventually she slaps him. The teenager screams and cries so loudly that the very elderly lady across the street (the elderly man passed on a few years back) calls the police for a case of child abuse. The mother gets arrested, and the father and his son are deeply saddened.\n\nOne day, the teen decides to try illegal drugs and alcohol. As he walks along the sidewalk, searching for illegal dealers, he hears a beautiful tune. He decides to drop illegal activities and start a band, simply because of this tune. When the new band is deciding a name, the teen begins to think: the elderly lady across the street  called the cops to get my mom arrested. If my mom wasn't arrested, I wouldn't have gotten interested in illegal activities. If I hadn't gotten into illegal activities, I wouldn't hear the song that made me start this. So technically, an elder caused me to start this band. But for her to know it was abuse the night I screamed and not me seeing a spider or something, she must have been experienced. She must have seen a thousand worlds. To see so many things, you gotta be brave!\n\nSo, the teen suggests they call themselves The Elder Who Is So Brave They Have Seen 1,000 Worlds. The band agrees, and they play loudly into the night.\n\nOne day, as the teen walks into the kitchen for breakfast, the father says that a new recording studio has opened up down the block and they're looking for \"new blood\" and that the band should try and get one of their songs up. The teen's new step-mother and baby step-sister laugh. Getting angry and feeling rebellious, the teen tells his band. They go down to the studio and find out that they now have a recording label.\n\nA couple years later, The Elder Who Is So Brave They Have Seen 1,000 Worlds is invited to a big studio in Hollywood since they've gained so much fame. Saying goodbye to their original recording label, the band and their families move to Hollywood. They release a new album, which tops the charts. Now the band is known by everyone.\n\nOne day, the band is practicing in the teen's garage. Suddenly, a small spider crawls in. The band screams, knocking over all of their equipment and causing a ruckus.\n\nSuddenly, a young woman who was watching the band on the sidewalk at the time began to laugh out loud. Another woman came along and asked what was so funny.\n\n\"This old guy just tore down his garage because of a tiny spider!\"\n\n(It's not funny until you imagine the scene, guys.)",

The entrance to the restaurant was across from the railing of the boat, and he looked out into the sea and pondered this huge event. He took out the ring and looked at it. \"Is this the person I want to marry?\" he asked himself. \"Do I want to spend the rest of my life with her? I love her, but... do I love her forever??\" He began to get antsy. Just as he realized that he loved her more than he could bear, that nothing could keep them apart for the rest of their days, and that this was the time to propose, a big wave crashed along the side of the boat, knocking the ring into the ocean.\n\nIt was seven o'clock. Disappointed, but undeterred, he went into the restaurant to meet his beloved. He sat down with her, trying to determine the best way to pop the question. The waiter came around and offered the specials, which they took without thinking. He got a lovely steak, and she got fresh fish, caught from the side of the boat.\n\nFor what felt like an eternity, he worked up the courage and found the right time to propose. The food came out, and he began. She cut into the fish just as he asked her those fateful words... and guess what was inside the fish?\n\n[The Dancing Cookie.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/33v1ba/the_dancing_cookie/)",

The duck pulled out a cigarette and struck a match, and ordered a second bottle.\n\n\"What's the problem? You trying to drink yourself to death? \n\n\"Maybe I am. Maybe my time is up, maybe it's time for this miserable old duck to finally fly south for the winter.\"\n\n\"Look, you keep talking like that people are gonna start thinking you need some help.

What do you have to say?\"\n\n\"...Ducks fly together.\"\n\n\"You son of a bitch.\"\n\nThe duck saw his reflection in the bottom of his empty shotglass. He was old, and bitter, and worthless, and all the other things he said he would never be. He looked up and saw the the other patrons, staring back at him with wide-eyes and slightly dropped jaws. \n\n\"I'm sorry everybody. I've just been so stressed lately, both under and above the water. Drinks are on me.\" \n\nAnd the duck drank with the patrons and there were smiles to be had. The duck felt so much better he bought the bar another round. And as he waddled out on the dance floor everything seemed a little brighter, the smell of foul beer and snuffed cigarettes faded from the air and even the jukebox sprang to life as the  duck gathered the confidence to approach a swan drinking a martini while the other drunken patrons vied for her attention. In a drunken swirl of self-confidence and momentum he stumbled up to the swan and whispered in her \" These niggas is fowl and its duck seazon.\"\n\nThe duck grabbed the swan and together they walked out of the bar onto a street that looked a little better - or at least less shitty - and a little bit more worth living for. They fell into a cab and as it drove away the bartender came out shouting \"You never paid! You never paid!\"\n\nAnd the duck stuck his head out of the window and shouted back.\n\n\"Put it on my bill!\"",

Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'\nSt. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground.

Just to be clear I am a white male in my early twenties so personally I have never experienced attacks of racial bias, but I do feel shame whenever I see a racially charged joke on here because I know for a fact that humor reflects personality. It's impossible to separate oneself from the humor that one finds affinity with. And if you think that a joke about a bunch of black people stealing a car because of the racial stereotype that black people commit crime is funny because of the content and not because of the irony of the racial bias that is being highlighted, then I have to say I think your a bad person. \n\nMaking jokes about racial prejudice isn't inherently racist. Just when the joke relies on the negative racial bias being a common thought. That makes it racist. \n\nMaybe I am overthinking this, but I know a lot of people don't like to think about race at all because the mere thought of it makes them worried they are going to be considered racist. That being said, if you don't think about racism then you can still be racist. So think about it you fucking racists. Think about why something is funny to you and if it's because of negative bias or harmful thoughts, then maybe try and think about something more positive.\n\nThere's enough racism out in the real world, we don't need to glorify it here.",

She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.\n\nThe next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her \"womanly\" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.\n\nBut the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.\n\nAnyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.\n\nDisclaimer: Reposted from 5 years ago.",

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\"\u00a0\n\n\nThe man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks again accept him, feed him, and again fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\"\u00a0\n\n\nThe man says, \"All right, all right. I'm dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?\"\u00a0\n\n\nThe monks reply, \"You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles, when you find these numbers, you will become a monk.\"\u00a0\n\n\nThe man sets about his task. Some 54 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.\u00a0\n\n\nHe says, \"I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.\"\u00a0\n\n\nThe monks reply, \"Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.\"\u00a0\n\n\nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door where the head monk says, \"The sound is right behind that door.\" The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked.\u00a0\n\n\nHe says, \"Real funny. May I have the key?\" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.\u00a0\n\n\nThe man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.\u00a0\n\n\nBehind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire, And so it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, the monks say, \"This is the last key to the last door.\"\u00a0\n\n\nThe man is relieved to know that he has finally reached to the end.\n\n\nHe unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.\u00a0\n\n\nBut he can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",

        "body": "Craigslist Email Conversation with Over Protective Father\n\n\nApril 22, 2015 at 6:39pm\n\nmichael Gruden \n10:03 PM (20 hours ago)\n\nHello, I'm an overprotective father looking to furnish my daughter's new apartment when she starts in UCF next semester, and I saw your ad on craigslist for couch and loveseat. When I purchase this couch I'll be periodically checking my daughter's furniture with a black light for semen stains. Call me crazy, I don't care. If I'm paying for her college, she has to save herself and put up with a crazy father.\nWhat I need to know is, will I find any prior to purchase and may I check it with a black light?\n\nDC2885\n3:59 PM (2 hours ago)\nto michael\nDear Mr. Gruden (Fellow American),\n\nThank you for your caring, and refreshing email.  You never really know what you are going to run into with this Craig's List but its good to know there is another flag waving Fellow American who considers Craig a friend. Let me first say I am so relieved that I'm not selling you the couch in my garage!\n\nAnyway, I am no expert in the spectrum of light colors so I am a little confused about your \"black light\". My wife and I have industry standard white lights? Do black lights give off black light to make a room darker? I struggle with stress based insomnia and this sounds like something I should look into to. \n\nSorry for my delay there. I was just GOOGLING what a black light is. Its a detective device to catch semen but also a \"party-starter\" (source: Wikipedia). Without delaying my response any further, I will do my best to answer your previously stated semen question.\n\nI can not imagine that there is any human semen on my couch, or loveseat (I guess its now a non love seat huh? chuckle, chuckle). I must admit that I do have a few real prankster friends though and there is just no telling what those boys have done that I have yet to find out about. I'll tell you what, there is nothing scarer than getting a firecracker full of flour stuffed in your tailpipe! Shayne got me good on that one! What I can assure you is that Lizel , my sister wife, REFUSES couch based intimacy so I can't imagine what your detective device would find.  In the interest of full transparency, when I am not home I have a nagging suspicion that Winston, our dog, finds the agility to POUNCE onto the couch and try to dig a hole in the cushion (no damage as such, just a gut-hunch). I can not determine or confirm his true intentions for this imaginary cubby hole hide-away. I suspect he may be part squirrel. Seems like he is always trying to bury nuts!!!! Damn Dog! \n\nI do not have children, Fellow American, however I can only hope to raise my unborn daughter(s) in the same self respecting way you are. I often chuckle chuckle with my wife that I will lock them up in a dark closet in baggy sweat shirts until they are 32, at which time I will hopefully be able to sell them exclusively for livestock. You might be thinking I should part ways with them for land based property but I have a pretty dynamic bullet proof plan to acquire A LOT of property in the next 32 years and by such time I will need the livestock for tax exemptions because the carrying costs can be very burdensome--much like a promiscuous daughter (See: Music Television Channel's TEEN MOM).\n\nFinally, I am hip to what the college students are doing these days. They are beyond random room searches, in fact they prepare for them. If you are going to do detective work at your daughter's place I highly suggest a FULL SWEEP OF THE AREA, not just on a specific piece of property. I can also connect you with Duane, who does personal security and we can put so many tracking devices on your daughter that she won't even know where she is!\n\nSorry for my long winded email. I hope that this helps to answer your questions. Please let me know if you would like to set up a meeting, and best wishes to you on your search for family-based purity.\n\nSincerely,\nYour Friend.\n\nmichael Gruden\n4:14 PM (2 hours ago)\n\nWhy would I meet with you if you're \"not going to sell me your couch\"????\nFrankly that sounds creepy and I didn't peruse craigslist to find creeps\n \n\nDC2885\n4:15 PM (2 hours ago)\nto michael\nOH Gee! No I meant you DEFINITELY DONT WANT THE COUCH in my GARAGE. Heavens, NO\n\nThe couch and Loveseat I posted about are inside our house!\n\nmichael Gruden\n4:17 PM (2 hours ago)\nIs your couch for sale or not?!?!\n\nDC2885\n4:19 PM (2 hours ago)\nto michael\nFellow American, \n\nYou are getting a little aggressive and making me uncomfortable. Are you asking if the couch in my garage WHICH YOU DEFINITELY DONT WANT is for sale?\n\nIf you are asking if the couch and loveseat in my house which I posted for sale yesterday is for sale well then I dont know why you are asking if it is for sale because I posted it for sale and you responded about purchasing my couch for sale and I responded about the purchase of my couch that is for sale.\n\nmichael Gruden\n4:25 PM (2 hours ago)\n\nIf you feel I'm aggressive, why did you post personal information?\nAnyway, my apologies if I came off as aggressive. I am just hesitant with these craigslist list things. Too many people endanger themselves. My daughter was actually going to furnish her own apartment on craigslist but she's too beautiful and I know she'd wind up dead. Nobody is going to want a slightly overweight and balding man such as myself.\nAnyway, my apologies for the confusion.\nWhen could I look at the couch ?\n \n\n \n\nDC2885\n4:52 PM (1 hour ago)\nto michael\nFellow American (Mr Gruden),\n\nI was raised with a fear of baldness. My mother's father was bald at the age of 30. I am told that you get your hair jeans from your mothers father. I never knew him. Died in a auto wreck. Guess he never passed his jeans on because I feel as though my politician like hair is one of my few redeeming qualities. My hair cutterer is cute too.\n\nI apologize for being redundant, but I am still confused on which couch you are referring to. Are you referring to THE COUCH IN MY GARAGE WHICH YOU DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT, or are you referring to the couch I originally posted about on the list which Craig manages? In an earlier email, you seemed to want THE COUCH MY GARAGE WHICH YOU DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT. Please advise so as to avoid future confusion.\n\nDid you se the recent news story about the UCF Student that was on LSD (laxidazical super drug) and had a bad trip last week? You definitely want your daughter to stay away from him!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The local Orlando news did a story. The kid just kept yelling \"MARY JANE, MARY JANE\" while they tased him. IS YOUR DAUGHTER NAMED MARY JANE?! OH GOD. IT MAY BE TOO LATE IN REGARDS TO SEMEN.\n\nI am glad you are protecting your daughter from the University of Central Florida and Greater Orlando Internet-Furniture-Salesman-Murderer(s). As aforementioned, I respect for fathering.\n\nPS. ARE YOU RELATED TO THE LEGENDARY JON GRUDEN (NFL COACH) AND HIS LESS IMPRESSIVE BROTHER WHO ONCE COACHED ARENA FOOTBALL IN ORLANDO AND NOW COACHES (KIND OF) THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS (also--do you have a stance on the team name?). MEMORIBILIA?\n\nmichael Gruden\n5:29 PM (1 hour ago)\nDear Mr. C\nI guess we're on a last name basis. Feel free to call me Mike anytime though Drew.  I definitely am talking about the couch in your living room if it's clean. I am very interested, at least my daughter seemed to like the pictures. You seem to obsess over small details, like balding. I'll give you some advice. Do not wear a hat too often. I'm convinced my balding is from my yamaka, as I'm only bald in the spot in which I wear it. Regarding relations to football Grudens, no I'm not related. My doctors last name is Carr. Do you have a doctor in your family here in Florida?\nAnyway, it's been nice chatting, but I'd like to get back to business.\nYes the couch in your living room.\n \n\n\nDC2885 \n6:09 PM (21 minutes ago)\nto michael\nDear Mr Gruden but Certainly Not a Football Gruden,\n\nThank you for your tips on male pattern baldness and prevention. My mother at one point always talked to me that if I continued to wear a hat I would go bald but I always thought she was just nagging me. I GUESS MOM WAS RIGHT AGAIN. I do have some gray hairs though. Some people say thats a distinguished look, and I say those people have a foot in the grave. I pull the gray hairs out because I struggle with colorless objects. I feel they present negative energy. I need to stop this as I am pulling myself towards baldness with each hair (pun intended). The only doctors in our family are the ones that my BROTHER SUES FOR BIG CHECKS! BREAK YO NECK? CALL CHARLIE! #CHECKS.\n\nI wore a yamaka once when I was a kid at Corey Hertz's bot mitzvah. I accidentally dropped a book on the floor during the service. Geez, I was so embarassed!!! That was in middle school and I ended up going to a different high school to start fresh! I am glad to hear that you are passing ON THE COUCH IN MY GARAGE WHICH YOU DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT. I think at this point, I am not going to sell my couch to your daughter (although she does seem lovely), as I don't want some creep in my house with a semen device!!!! BECAUSE WHAT IF SOMETHING IS FOUND THAT LIZEL MY SISTER WIFE CANT EXPLAIN. I CAN NOT DEAL WITH THAT! NO SIR! NOT TODAY! \n\nPS. Here is a picture I found of the Gruden (NFL) Family from a historical point in time. Just in case you don't remember a distant family member. Disclaimer: I was not there when the photo was taken and I can not (unfortunately) provide accurate photographer credit.\n\n \n\nBest of luck in your search for a semen free seating/nap device for your daughter. I hope you can find a couch that pulls out. I like those pull out couches as they provide options for napping and visitors. I am sorry to bother your business dealings, you contacted me first!!!!\n\nPrayers For Your Future Son in Law.\n\nYour Fellow American.\n\nmichael Gruden\n6:16 PM (13 minutes ago)\nto frf3g-49900887.\nHonestly is the couch in your living room for sale or not and may I look at it?\n \n\nDC2885 to michael\n6:30 PM (0 minutes ago)\nto michael\nPLEASE LEAVE US ALONE WE CAN NOT SELL EITHER COUCH TO YOU. \n",

The police officer, having patiently waited all this time, now started up the patrol car, put on the flashing lights, promptly pulled the man over and carried out a breathalyzer test. To his amazement, the breathalyzer indicated no evidence of the man having consumed alcohol at all! \n\nDumbfounded, the officer said \"I'll have to ask you to accompany me to the police station. This breathalyzer equipment must be broken.\"\n\n\"I doubt it\", said the man, \"tonight I'm the designated decoy.\"",

The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people. The second kingdom is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power, too. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.\n\n\nThe kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it\u2019s a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of their finest knights, clad in the best armor and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 of their knights, with fine leather armor and a few dozen squires of their own. \nThe third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire.\n\n\nThe night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and make merry, partying into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and also drink late into the night.\n\nIn the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and slings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight.\n\n\nThe next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hung over and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old and weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night, but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.\n\n\nIt just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides\u200b.\n\n\n***BONUS***: Today in class, my professor (who earned his PhD at age 30) was discussing thermodynamics and such, when he uttered the phrase, \"Cold is not dark.\"",

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.\n\nWell, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.\n\nWell, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal - three bananas.\n\n\"You know what? No,\" said the executioner. \"I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.\" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.\n\nThe man looked at the executioner and said \"Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.\"\n",

As he's riding to work, he's sees a hearse in front of him and thinks \"I wonder who died?\" He tries to ride past the hearse and hears a sound from inside the hearse that goes like \"Whomp. Whomp. Whomp.\"\n\nHe steps off his hoverboard. \"Whomp.\" it goes again. He knocks on the window, which are really tinted. The \"Whomp\" gets louder and notices its coming from the back of the hearse. He goes to the back of the hearse and thinks that someone might be in there!\n\nHe hears a huge \"Whomp\" and the back explodes and a coffin slides out the back of the hearse. He goes up to the coffin and thinks \"Someone might be in there!\" The coffin suddenly stands up vertically and turns towards him. It then jumps a little towards with a \"Whomp\".\n\nA police officer walks towards him and says \"Is this your hearse?\"\nThe guy says \"No. I came here on a hoverboard. I was just riding to work on it.\" The officer says \"Oh, that thing on the curb?\" and asks to try it. The guy says \"Sure.\" and then the Coffin just slams down and crushed the officer.\n\nThe guy then thinks \"Woah I should get out of here!\" He runs over to his hoverboard and speeds off, but the coffin is jumping towards him again. And the coffin is going \"Whomp\" again. And the guys like \"Oh I should have got a car\" \"Whomp\" it goes again.\n\nHe sees a verizion wireless store ahead and decides to call the police, because there might be phones thread and he doesn't have one. So he goes into the store and says \"Oh I need to use a phone because its an emergency\" the guy behind the counter says \"Hey, is that a hoverboard? Is it any good?\" the guy says \"yeah sure\" and the counter guy asks to try it.\n\n They both go outside, with counter guy on the hoverboard and starts riding towards the door, but the coffin just fucking \"Whomp\"''s through the door and decapitates him. The guy is like \"shit this day is shit\" The hoverboard rolled out from underneath by the way.\n\nThe coffin then turns to him and the guy speeds off on the hoverboard with the coffin jumping behind him. The guy decides to go home because there's a cord phone there. He sees his house and goes to his front door, which has one of those keypad locks and he puts in the code, but its wrong because he changed it. he puts in the new one and enters.\n\nHe shuts the door and locks it and the \"Whomp\" stops. He hears a knock like half an hour later. He opens the door and the coffin is there and it slides into his house. The guy is like \"oh fuck\" and he begins to run away from the coffin. The coffin then just starts destroying shit while running after him.\n\nIts coming after him and the guy runs into the hallway and the coffin is still destroying shit while chasing after him. Then the guy locks himself in the bathroom and the coffin breaks down the door and the guy opens his medicine door.\n\nAnd he throws some cough medicine at the coffin and it just stops.",

He walk around until it becomes apparent he is alone on an island except for a pig and a dog, both of which are strangely domesticated. Oh well, time to Robinson Crusoe the shit out of this island. \n\nHe starts a fire. Builds himself a hut. Starts a sizeable garden so he won't have to eat Ms. Oinky. \n\nTime passes. He starts \"getting lonely.\" Manual release stops being quite so gratifying. Ms. Oinky starts to look a lot more attractive. He resists because it's wrong. It's disgusting. But in the end he couldn't resist. He walked up behind Ms. Oinky, feeling terrible about himself. He lowered his tattered pants...all of a sudden the dog went batshit crazy. It charged right at him barking and snapping. It was inches away from biting his dick. The guy runs away and the dog immediately calms back down. The guy damn near has a heart attack and decides to get back to the whole island survival thing. \n\nHe makes some crude tools out of rocks. Digs an irrigation ditch for his garden. Starts work on a rudimentary still. \n\nBut soon, he starts to feel urges again. His hands are rough and calloused, sore from long days of hard labor (and a lot of masturbation). Ms. Oinky starts looking good again. \n\nThis time he plans it. He walks to the far side of the island with the dog. They play fetch for an hour. The dog finally collapses on the beach, having a happy dog nap. The man sneaks away back to where he left Ms. Oinky. He steps behind her. Lowers his pants. Closes his eyes and tries to remember what boobs look like. \n\nThen out of fucking nowhere that damn dog EXPLODES out of the bushes, barking his damn head off. The guy sets a new world record for pulling up pants. What the fuck is up with that dog?\n\nThe next day a plane crashes off the shore. It hit pretty hard, and none of the doors opened so the guy assumed there were no survivors. He decides to swim out to it and see if he can find anything worthwhile to salvage. Inside it's kind of dark, but somehow he stumbles onto an unconscious survivor. He swims them back to shore, and in the middle of CPR he notices the survivor is a woman, and she is HOT. Not just hot like any woman would be hot to a guy who's been trapped on a deserted island for months would be hot, like objectively gorgeous.\n\nThe babe coughs a couple of times and looks around. She grasps the situation pretty quickly and says some of the usual damsel in distress stuff, \"Oh my hero! you saved my life! I'll do anything to repay you.\" \n\nThe guy was kind of zoning out while staring at her --I mean, it's been awhile since he's seen anyone, let alone anyone so gorgeous-- but that last sentence snaps him back to reality. \"Wait,\" he replied, \"you'd do *anything*?\"\n\nShe looks back at him seductively (well, as seductively and someone who was just damn near drowned could...which in her case was still pretty fucking seductive) and said \"Anything.\"\n\nHe gave her another good long look. Then said, \"Great! Do me a favor and hold that dog!\" ",

It is a known fact that the penguin is a very ritualistic bird which lives an extremely ordered and complex life. The penguin is very committed to its family and will mate for life, as well as maintain a form of compassionate contact with its offspring throughout its life. \n\nIf a penguin is found dead on the ice surface, other members of the family and social circle have been known to dig holes in the ice, using their vestigial wings and beaks, until the hole is deep enough for the dead bird to be rolled into, and buried.\n\nThe male penguins then gather in a circle around the grave and sing:  \n\n\n\"Freeze a jolly good fellow...\nFreeze a jolly good fellow.\"",

They looked around, and on the edge of it, by the antiforrest there was an anticottage. Antismoke flew from the antichimney - 'The antihut must be inhabited!', they thought ecstatically. They came closer, took a peek through the antiwindow - the antihut seemed empty. So they reached the antiknob, opened the antidoor, and in the antihall, by the antitable the antisemites sat.\n***\n\nTranslated from Polish, did the best I could.",

By the time the U.N. meeting was over, the two had become fast friends. \n\nAs they parted company at the airport, Umballa told Vladimir, ''One day, you must visit my country, and try our version of your roulette.'' \nA year later, Vladimir was in Zambia, and looked up his old friend.

This one caught me by surprise. \n\nOver the last month I became a victim of a clever scam while out shopping. Simply going out to get supplies has turned out to be quite traumatic. Don't be naive enough to think it couldn't happen to you or your friends. Here's how the scam works: \n\nTwo seriously good-looking 20-21 year-old girls come over to your car as you are packing your shopping into the trunk. They both start wiping your windshield with a rag and Windex, with their breasts almost falling out of their skimpy T-shirts. \n\nIt is impossible not to look. \n\nWhen you thank them and offer them a tip, they say 'No' and instead ask you for a ride to McDonalds. \n\nYou agree and they get into the back seat. On the way, they start undressing. Then one of them climbs over into the front seat and starts crawling all over you, while the other one steals your wallet. \n\nI had my wallet stolen January 4th, 9th, 10th, twice on the 15th, 17th, 20th, 24th & 29th. Also February 1st & 4th, Twice on the 8th, 16th, 23rd, 26th & 30th, three times last Monday and very likely again this upcoming weekend. \n\nSo tell your friends to be careful. \n\nP.S. Wal-Mart has wallets on sale for 2.99 each. I found cheaper ones for $1.99 at K-Mart and bought them out. Also, you never will get to eat at McDonalds.

The following day the teacher asks for the first volunteer to tell their story.\nLittle Suzy raises her hand. \"My dad owns a farm and every Sunday we load the chicken eggs on the truck and drive into town to sell them at the market. Well, one Sunday we hit a big bump and all the eggs flew out of the basket and onto the road.\"\nWhen the teacher asked for the moral of the story, Suzy replied, \"Don't keep all your eggs in one basket.\"\nLittle Lucy went next. \"My dad owns a farm too. Every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator. Last weekend only eight of the 12 eggs hatched.\"\nAgain, the teacher asked for the moral of the story.\nLucy replied, \"Don't count your chickens before they hatch.\"\nNext up was little Johnny. \"My uncle Ted fought in the Vietnam war, and his plane was shot down over enemy territory. He jumped out before it crashed but could only take a case of beer, a machine gun and a machete. On the way down, he drank the case of beer. Then he landed right in the middle of 100 Vietnamese soldiers. He shot 70 with his machine gun, but then he ran out of bullets! So he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more. Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.\"\nThe teacher looked a little shocked. After clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story.\n\"Well,\" Johnny replied, \"Don't f**k with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking.\"\n\"But Doctor,\" Bill replied, \"I feel great. I haven't felt better in years. This just can't be true. Isn't there anything I can do?\" \n\nAfter a moment the doctor said, \"Well, you might start going down the street to that new health spa and take a mud bath every day.\" \n\nExcitedly Bill asked, \"And that will cure me?\" \n\n\"No,\" replied the doctor, \"but it will get you used to the dirt.\"",

He walks into the church, steps into the confessional, and tells the priest: \"bless me, Father, for I have sinned: I have committed adultery!\"\n\nThe Father reassures him that we all stray, we are all welcome back in His Holy Embrace; but to give absolution, the confession must be full. He needs names, and dates.\n\n\"Bur Father, I swore on all the Holy Names that I would never tell - and breaking my oath would be a mortal sin, wouldn't it?\"  \n\nThe priest pondered the contradiction, and came up with a solution: \"If I guess who it was, then you wouldn't have broken your vow, now would you?\" to which the young man agreed, no.\n\n\"So: was it Julie, the new maths teacher in our elementary school?\" - \"No, Father, it wasn't her.\" \n\n\"Was it the widow Flaherty, who runs the tourist information bureau?\" - \"No, Father, it wasn't her.\" \n\n\"Was it Maggie, the barmaid at The Shoving Leopard?\" - \"No, Father, it wasn't her.\"\n\n\"Well, my son - until you give full contrition, I can't grant you absolution.\"\n\nHe walks out of the church, and joins his Protestant friend... who had been waiting patiently... \n\n\"Hah!

You must punish him.\"\n\n\"You are right, but you know what? I am king of the jungle and I must not lower myself to his level. Let's ignore it.\"\n\nThe lioness, astonished, sat in silence. Yet the monkey kept on. After sometime, the lioness looses her patience.\n\n\"I cannot allow this any longer. I'm going to teach that monkey a lesson.\"\n\nSo the lioness chases after the monkey. After a long chase she finds herself out of the jungle and at a construction site. She sees the monkey going through a narrow pipe and leaps in after him. The pipe apparently was not large enough, and the lioness gets stuck.\n\nSeeing that the lioness is stuck, the monkey walks around behind her.\n\n\"Who's a bad girl? Who's a bad girl?!!\" he yells as he screws her from behind, over and over again. The monkey has his way and then finally leaves with a big smile on his face.\n\nAfter an hour long struggle, the lioness finally frees herself from the pipe. Injured, and completely embarrassed, she returns home to the jungle and to her king.\n\n\"So how did the hunt go?\" the lion curiously asked.\n\nThe lioness couldn't even look at him.\n\n\"Aaahhh, he took you to the construction site didn't he?\"\n",

The farmer asked the guys \"What are you two doing out here?\" The men explained the whole thing that just happened with the goat.

Dan was down on hard times; He caught his wife cheating on him with another man. His two kids won\u2019t talk to him anymore. He lost his house to his wife in the divorce. The only thing Dan had left was his flower delivery business, Dan\u2019s Daffodils, which he ran out of the same white delivery van he lived in.\n\nThe first incident happened in June. Dan had just been denied for a business loan from the bank. As he was parked outside in his van, three masked men jumped in and told him to drive. Fearing for his life, he drove off. Turns out the men were bank robbers and Dan\u2019s van matched the getaway vehicle. At his trial, Judge Holz said \u201cDaniel, I am inclined to believe this is a bit of a misunderstanding. This is your first warning.\u201d\n\nThe second incident happened in August. Dan parked in a secluded parking lot to sleep in his van for the night. In the hot California sun, he stripped naked to cool off. In the morning, he was awoken by two police officers, naked as the day he was born, in an elementary school parking lot. At his second trial, Judge Holz said \u201cDaniel, it\u2019s getting hard to believe this is all a misunderstanding. This is your second warning.\u201d\n\nThe third incident happened in September. Things were starting to look up for Dan\u2019s flower delivery business; he just booked a big contract with a funeral home. He went to a bar to celebrate that evening and had a few too many. He stumbled home to his van and passed out in the driver\u2019s seat, which according to California law, is Intent to Drive under the Influence. As he walked into the courthouse, he saw Judge Holz sitting on the bench. Judge Holz turned to him and said \u201cDamn Daniel, back at it again with that white van!\u201d\n",

Is there anything for which your heart still yearns?\"\n\nCinderella was taken aback, overjoyed, and after some thoughtful consideration, she uttered her first wish: \"The prince was wonderful, but not much of an investor. I'm living hand to mouth on my disability checks, and I wish I were wealthy beyond comprehension.\"\n\nInstantly her rocking chair turned into solid gold.\n\nCinderella said, \"Ooh, thank you, Fairy Godmother!\"\n\nThe fairy godmother replied, \"It is the least that I can do. What do you want for your second wish?\"\n\nCinderella looked down at her frail body, and said, \"I wish I were young and full of the beauty and youth I once had.\"\n\nAt once, her wish became reality, and her beautiful young visage returned - and Cinderella felt stirrings inside her that had been dormant for years.\n\nThen the fairy godmother spoke once more: \"You have one more wish; what shall it be?\"\n\nCinderella looked over to the frightened cat in the corner and said, \"I wish for you to transform Bob, my old cat, into a kind and handsome young man.\"\n\nMagically, Bob suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his biological make-up that, when he stood before her, he was a man so beautiful the likes of him neither she nor the world had ever seen.\n\nThe fairy godmother said, \"Congratulations, Cinderella, enjoy your new life.\" With a blazing shock of bright blue electricity, she was gone as suddenly as she appeared.\n\nFor a few eerie moments, Bob and Cinderella looked into each other's eyes. Cinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most beautiful, stunningly perfect man she had ever seen.\n\nThen Bob walked over to Cinderella, who sat transfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his young, muscular arms. He leaned in close, blowing her golden hair with his warm breath as he whispered....\n\n\"Bet you're sorry now that you cut my nuts off!\"\n",

And all of you sons of bitches who are getting on, get your asses in the train, cause we're going down the tracks.\" The mother went nuts and told her son, \"We don't use that kind of language in this house. Now I want you to go to your room and you are to stay there for TWO HOURS. When you come out, you may play with your train, but I want you to use nice language.\" Two hours later, the son comes out of the bedroom and resumes playing with his train. Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say, \"All passengers who are disembarking from the train, please remember to take all of your belongings with you. We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon.\" She hears the little boy continue, \"For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat. Remember, there is no smoking on the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us today.\" As the mother began to smile, the child added, \"For those of you who are pissed off about the TWO HOUR delay, please see the bitch in the kitchen.\"",

In order to catch her in the act, I came home to our apartment from work a few hours earlier. She was naked in the bed. I became enraged and started looking around the house for the man but could not find him. I ran out to the balcony and I saw hands hanging from the railing. I was so furious that with all my rage I summoned the strength to pick up our refrigerator and threw it over at him so he would fall to his death. That was when my wife shot me for killing her lover and she said she never loved me.\n\nSt. Peter: Wow, i'm very sorry to hear about your wife cheating and killing you. That is a terrible way to die. Let's hear the next story.\n\nMan 2: Well, I was out on my balcony of my apartment building watering some plants when a bird flew at my head and scared me. I tripped and fell over the railing. Lucky, I caught on the the railing of the balcony just below mine. I saw a man exit his house and I was about to ask for his help when he quickly re-entered the house, then came back carrying a fridge! I was so confused, and then the bastard just threw the fridge over and it caused me to let go and fall to my death, with the fridge crushing all my bones.\"\n\nSt. Peter: Oh that's just terrible luck.

Now I want you to go to your room and you are to stay there for TWO HOURS. When you come out, you may play with your train, but I want you to use nice language.\"  Two hours later, the son comes out of the bedroom and resumes playing with his train. Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say, \"All passengers who are disembarking from the train, please remember to take all of your belongings with you. We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon.\"  She hears the little boy continue, \"For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat. Remember, there is no smoking on the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us today.\"  As the mother began to smile, the child added, \"For those of you who are pissed off about the TWO HOUR delay, please see the b*tch in the kitchen.\"",

Pick up a white dress shirt while you are at it. Get one with a collar that matches your face. I like small spread collars. Some people have tall necks and need taller collars.\n\nStep 5. Only now can you start dressing up. WeR your jeans with OCBD and treat yourself to a navy blazer. Make sure it fits. Not baggy. Not long. Try it on with your shirt tucked into your jeans.\n\nStep 6. Go out wearing your blazer and your dress shirt to the pants store. Pick up some dressier pants to replace the jeans. Olive chinos? Grey slacks? Whichever looks right. Wear it. Tuck your shirt into it.\n\nStep 7. Now you can shop for a tie or two to complete the outfit.\n\nStep 8. Realize you have a few pants, a few shirts, a couple ties, and a couple pairs of shoes to all interchage and one inconspicuous blazer to throw on top. Wear every combination you own with and without the blazer and ties at this point for a full day outside of home. Once you reached that point, start adding one new item a time.

Before you enter heaven, I will be assigning each of you a vehicle based upon your fidelity in your relationship with your wife.

We were having rough times, and I had a drinking problem. But I came clean, we stayed together, and I loved my wife truly for the rest of my life!\"\n\nPeter replies, \"You spoke honestly, and I see you did love your wife.

One room has a clerk who inputs computerized records of what each applicant did on his or her last day of life.\n\nThe first applicant of the day explains that his last day was not a good one. \"I came home early and found my wife lying naked in bed. She claimed she had just gotten out of the shower. Well, her hair was dry and I checked the shower and it was completely dry too. I knew she was into some hanky-panky and I began to look for her lover. I went onto the balcony of our 9th floor apartment and found the SOB clinging to the rail by his finger tips. I was so angry that I began bashing his fingers with a flower pot. He let go and fell, but his fall was broken by some awnings and bushes. On seeing he was still alive I found super human strength to drag our antique cedar chest to the balcony and throw it over. It hit the man and killed him. At this point the stress got to me and I suffered a massive heart attack and died.\n\nThe clerk thanked him and sent him on to the next office.\n\nThe second applicant said that his last day was his worst. \"I was on the roof of an apartment building working on the AC equipment. I stumbled over my tools and toppled off the building. I managed to grab onto the balcony rail of a 9th floor\napartment but some idiot came rushing out on the balcony and bashed my hands with a flower pot. I fell but hit some awnings and bushes and survived, but as I looked up I saw a huge chest falling toward me. I tried to crawl out of the way but failed and was hit and killed by the chest.\"\n\nThe clerk couldn't help but chuckle as he directs the man to the next room.\n\nHe is still giggling when his third customer of the day enters. He apologizes and says \"I doubt that your last day was as interesting as the fellow in here just before you.\"\n\n\"I don't know\" replies the man,  \"picture this, I'm buck naked, hiding in this cedar chest.....\"",

When you\u2019re as old as I am and have been a Nun as long as I have, you get a chance to see and hear just about everything.

The man was immediately arrested and taken to jail, where he was given his one phone call. The man called his longtime friend. The friend said, \u201cListen, I\u2019ve never met a more disgusting human being in my life, but I\u2019ll find you a lawyer.\u201d\n\nThe friend gave the man three options. The first attorney was the best one money could buy, but incredibly expensive. The man chose not to hire him because of his cost. The second attorney was good, but still pricey. The man thought he was also too expensive. The friend then presented the third option, attorney Martin Goldstein of Goldstein, Goldstein & Leibowitz, who wasn\u2019t a good attorney, but was great at jury selection. Eager to save money, the man decided to hire Goldstein. The two met, and Goldstein assured the man that he would be tried by a jury of his peers.\n\nA few months later, the man\u2019s trial was underway. The zookeeper was testifying and being cross-examined by the prosecutor. \u201cDo you recognize anyone who was at the zoo on the morning of April 17th?\u201d asked the prosecutor. \u201cSure,\u201d said the zookeeper.  \u201cCan you point him out?\u201d asked the prosecutor. The zookeeper pointed to the defendant.\n\n\u201cWas this man at the zoo on the morning of April 17th?\u201d asked the prosecutor. \u201cOf course,\u201d said the zookeeper. \u201cAnd did this man have sexual intercourse with a goat?\u201d asked the prosecutor. \u201cHe did indeed,\u201d said the zookeeper. \u201cCan you describe what the man did?\u201d asked the prosecutor. \u201cWell,\u201d began the zookeeper, \u201cthe man jumped the fence, pulled down his trousers, inserted his penis into the back of the goat, and finished.\u201d \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d asked the prosecutor. \u201cThen the goat licked his genitals,\u201d said the zookeeper.\n\nIn the jury box, one juror turned to another and whispered \u201cNow THAT\u2019s a sign of a good goat.\u201d",

One of the frat boys leaves the group and begins hitting on group of women that are seated at the other side of the bar.  The women are not into it, but the frat boy is ignoring their rebukes, until one of the women steps up and physically pushes the guy away.  As he retreats back to group, he starts making obscene jokes and gestures and is taking his anger out on other random people in the bar, trying to act tough and save face.\n\nAt this point, the man in the corner gets up and stumbles over to the group of frat guys.  Immediately, they begin to tease him about wearing glasses and looking like a nerd.  The man takes it all in stride and starts joking back with them.  They soon welcome him to their group.  He then says, \"Since you guys are from out of town, you probably don't know it but the winds up here are strong enough that if you step over the balcony and spread your arms, you can float on the wind.\"  While drunk, the frat boys call bullshit on the man and tell him to prove it.  He casually walks over to the edge, climbs over and jumps off, spreading his arms and legs like an eagle.  After a quick drop, he floats back up and is riding the wind between the skyscrapers.\n\nThe recently rejected frat boy decides that this would help regain his confidence and decides to join the man out in the air.  As he steps off the outside of balcony, he drops like a rock.  He immediately starts screaming and as his life flashes before his eyes, he is plummeting towards the ground.  Inches from the pavement, he feels a tug on his leg and looks up to see the local man grabbing his leg and lifting him back towards the night sky and the balcony above.  Once back on solid ground it is evident the frat guy has shit his pants and his face is white as a ghost.  He immediately convinces the group to leave and the bar returns to it's normal, quiet, self.

Alarmed, Tiger starts to retreat when the bear casually asks Tiger what he's doing.  Having never spoken to a black bear before, Tiger was a little hesitant at first but upon realizing that the bear was not a threat he tries his best to explain the game of golf to this black bear.  After learning that it is a game played competitively, the bear asks to be shown how to play and wants to place a friendly wager that he could beat Tiger.  Confident in his abilities to beat a rookie golfer, let alone a black bear, Tiger agrees to a one hole playoff over a piece of Fruit Stripe gum.  Tiger goes first and snacks a line drive straight down the middle of the fairway.  The black bear then grabs a club but as he approaches the tee box he freezes, turns to Tiger and asks, \"What do I do now?\"  Wanting to be fair, Tiger points to a tree off in the distance saying \"See that tree over there, hit the ball just to the left of that on the short green grass.\"  The bear then tees off and hits an incredibly accurate shot, landing within 5 yards of the area Tiger had told him to aim.  When the bear goes to hit his second shot, he again asks what to do, to which Tiger responds by pointing to a pond separating the fairway from the green and tells the bear to land it just short of the water. Miraculously the black bear does the impossible a second time. Astonished, but still focused on winning the wager, Tiger hits an equally exceptional shot to land just ahead of the black bears second shot.  Once more, the bear has to ask what the next step of the game is to which Tiger replies, \"Ahh yes, you see the flag on the green over there? The object of the game is to get the ball into that small cup in the fewest number of shots.\" The black bear, furious at this point, replies, \"WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT ON THE FIRST SHOT!\" \n\nTl;dr: How Tiger lost his Stripes.",

You find out she's in a shitty marriage, probably has a criminal record that she seems to think is no big deal, a laundry list of failed friendships, and all those things you \"had in common\" were a product of her agreeing with everything you said. You realize this was a bad idea, so you move onto Santa Clause.\n\nSanta promises to make your dreams come true. That debt you have? Gone. All those problems? Gone. Great! you've finally made a friend you can count on! While he wasn't lying about WANTING to help with all of that, you remember that Santa isn't real, and figure out Santa is actually the owner of the bar. He's now offered you free drinks all night but after having a few, you get a check. Confused, you look at it and see that the drinks were actually free, but he instead is charging you the tax on the drink, a delayed cover charge, a \"convenience\" fee, a pouring fee, and a delivery fee. Next thing you know, your free drinks actually cost you more than if you had just bought them. You realize there's more to pay for free than not, so you say no thanks, and approach the popular guy.\n\nWow this guy is cool! And he wants to be YOUR friend?! NO WAY! Now you have a rich and cool friend! Friendship should come easy to him, considering he has so much money, right?! Yeah, sure, he thinks the people in the corner with the funny hats and the stupid accents should be escorted out. Sure, he talks shit about everybody you know, but that's just his ego, right? There's no way he would talk about you behind your back! Not you! He's the one who asked you, remember? Then you realize all of your best friends have stopped talking to you. Even your business colleagues have ceased relations with you. You're not taken seriously anymore, and even worse off, the cool dude isn't hitting you up anymore to hang out. He doesn't reply to your texts or calls. You're left with the memory of a fun ride, and that's about it.

With nowhere to go, and hoping that the nuns will think he is a statue, he stands perfectly still, holding the two bars of soap. \n\nThe nuns approach and the first nun says, \"Oh my, look at that! Isn't that the most life-like statue you've ever seen?\" She steps up for a closer look, reaches out and gives a couple of tugs on the priest's weenie. Startled, he drops the first bar of soap. \n\n\"Oh Heavens,\" she exclaims, \"I got a bar of soap!\" \n\nThe second nun is also amazed at how realistic the statue looks, so she steps in for a closer look. She takes a couple of yanks on the priest's weenie, and he drops the other bar of soap. \n\n\"My goodness, I got a bar of soap also!\" \n\nThe nuns can't believe it. \n\nThe third nun, overcome by the miracle statue, walks up to it and gives a few tugs to the priest's weenie. \n\n\"My God, this is amazing,\" she says, \"I got liquid soap!\"",

They say, \"What's 2+2?\" And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. It's terrible. It's just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you. First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, \"10101000101\", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. Ok? Alright. Thank you.\"\n\n\n\n\nThis was a comment on FB, not my own. But, I felt the need to share!",

They were very proud of their ingenuity. A consom\u00e9 of edamame was most popular among the Democrats, however a few faithfully subsisted on some muscadines they tried to grow in office.\nAlaska \u2022 28 delegates\nRepublicans flip flopped around in a Shark Fin Soup but we have to wait until March 26th to know how the Democrats prefer their Ceviche.\nColorado \u2022 66 delegates\nAll of the soup in Colorado is excellent, no jokes here.

By the time July rolls around, the Republicans\u2019 soup will old and smelly in the fridge and it will probably not be edible.\nGeorgia \u2022 102 delegates\nThe Republican party had more ham but the FCC might be fining $1000 for failure to identify what animals they actually ate. The chickenhawk & dumplings was the Democratic favorite.\nMassachusetts \u2022 91 delegates\nDemocrats came up with a neat idea to use razor clams in a New England chowder but they settled on a she-crab soup instead. Republicans gobbled the guk.\nMinnesota \u2022 77 delegates\nIn a refreshing change for Republican diners, Ajiaco was the crowd favorite while Democrats feasted on Lutefisk.\nOklahoma \u2022 38 delegates\nWhile the state is still searching for its signature soup, Republicans went with a prociutto-wrapped jelly donut. The bacon end got burnt, and the belly came up on top. For the Democrats, it was a Coffee Party USA, they swept in on a wind Dean Dozen of the plain, cake donuts- the best of the donuts.\nTennessee \u2022 67 delegates\nA coalition was formed to procure a spread of country hams for the Republicans. Diners preferred the taste of animals that were willing to be slaughtered. Sanders supporters got tired of soup too so they started pouring bourbon to accompany neglected goo goos clusters while the majority of the Democrats imagined a future of lame duck soup noodles in a blue bowl.\nTexas \u2022 222 delegates\nLunch pail democrats we\u2019re not pleased with their party\u2019s decision to go with Mrs. Grass as the golden nugget has been discontinued. Republicans opted for their shelf staple, Campbell\u2019s Chunky Barbecue Seasoned Pork.\nVermont \u2022 16 delegates\nThe grassroots vegetable soup stole the show on the Democratic menu here. In a Frankenfood alternative, Republicans opted for the Government cheddar cheese dip.\nVirginia \u2022 95 delegates\nDemocrats decided to start smoking, they thought it was more enjoyable than than eating too much.

I ended up calling the number and some guy answered, it sounded like he was driving as i could hear road noise and he had me on speakerphone. After he said hello, I explained to him that his number was on the men's room stall at the bar i was at. He immediately started yelling off the cuff about his ex. \"What the fuck is that bitch doing? I SWEAR i'M GOING TO KILL HER!\" After i calmed him down, he asked me where this was and i told him the name of the place. He apologized and asked if i could wait there. Sure, i was partially buzzed and had no where to go, so why not right? \n\nAbout 10 minutes later in walks this dude in a pizza uniform. Holy shit, it's just some kid. probably early 20's. Him and i get to talking and he's telling me about his crazy af ex-gf who he found in bed with his dorm-mate. After he caught her, she flew off the handle, it seems. Tore up his microbiology final and threw his pet hamster across the room, killing it on the concrete wall. \n\nHe goes on for a few minutes, and i'm even feeling slightly rage filled about how much of a bitch one person can be. I ask him if i can buy him a drink because, hell, he looks like he could use one. Sure he replies, he called up his boss and told him he was taking a dinner break.\n\nThis kid, \"Steve\" tells me about how he can best get revenge on her. I come up with a plan. I ask Steve where his ex-lives I call the pizzeria he works with and order the house-special, no shrooms, because fuck mushrooms, amirite? But i tell them i want Steve to deliver them of course i give them her address. Steve runs back to the shop, picks up the pizza with instructions to return to me.\n\nSteve gets back about 45 minutes later. We get in his car and i tell him to drive me to her place. We get there and i tell him to just lean the seat back and stay hidden, i got this. I go up to the porch of the house and ring the door. Nothing. i wait a couple moments and ring again. I start looking around and happen to notice a curtain pushed open and a head looking out to the driveway. Suddenly i hear \" THAT FUCKING COCKSUCKER IS STALKING ME!\" i'm guessing she recognized the car. A couple of other loud voices seem to eminate from the other side of the house but i can't make out what they're saying. i hear a couple of loud footsteps and then the locks are unlocking from the door an what appears but this petite redhead, who, despite being in a fit of rage, is actually quite stunning. She started to yell, but quickly stopped when she realized that i was not Steve.\n\nI told her how i was the manager of the pizza place and heard that he broke up with her. How he had some pictures on his phone of her and i really wanted to get in touch with her as i had been recently divorced and that Steve was being a shit at work and wanted to get revenge on him. She seemed to open up to the idea that he was going to be fired from the job and would go along with any idea of doing something to crush his spirit. She asked me what i'm going to need in order to put my plan in action. I turned to her and motioned towards the pizza and that it was getting hot on my hand and she had me bring the pizza inside so we could discuss the plan. She asked about Steve's car, and i told her that it was actually a coincidence and that i was borrowing his car because mine broke down, and i just needed to run an errand while he stayed back at the shop. We worked out a devious plan to set up Steve and ate some pizza while i talked about his downfall. When all was said and done, she was actually quite happy and offered to pay for the pizza, knowing how Steve was going to end up in jail soon enough. I respectfully declined, she insisted again. I told her no, but i need some cash to put gas in the car, as the fuel light had come on. She asked me how much i need and i said \"Oh, about tree-fiddy\"",

The mob boss agrees and says he needs three rival mobsters \"taken care of\" as soon as possible. Arthur agrees, reluctantly, and asks how he can find these guys. The mob boss informs Arthur that his target will be at the corner grocery store the next day at noon. He also instructs Arthur to not use any weapons, as they can be messy. \n\nThe next day, Arthur sees the three gentlemen outside the grocery store, as Sal predicted they'd be. Arthur, being a large, muscular man, is able to get behind them and, somehow, strangle them all before anyone sees him. \n\nHe returns shortly after to Big Sal and informs him that the deed was done. The mob boss, impressed, hands Arthur a single dollar for his payment. Arthur, enraged that he had been cheated into doing something horrible and riddled with guilt, calls the police on himself and Big Sal and informs the authorities about their deal. \n\nThe newspaper headline the next day: ARTY CHOKES THREE FOR A DOLLAR AT LOCAL GROCERY STORE. \n",

After a few minutes the horse is done and the man says \"well thats enough for 4 days worth!\"  So, finally, the third man take his horse to the trough and when the horse starts drinking the man picks up two flat rocks, walks behind the horse, and SMASHES the horses nuts between them. The horse sucks in a HUGE gulp of water and the man says \"well fellas, thats definitely enough water for my horse to go 7 days without a drink, pay up!\"\nThe men accept their defeat and pay their dues. One man, still in awe, says \"doesnt that hurt?\"  And he replys \"only if you get your fingers caught between the rocks!\"",

Each orders their drinks, and as the waiter is walking away, the woman notices a spoon in his chest pocket.\n\n*Hm... That's strange*  She thinks to herself.\n\nShe looks around, and notices other waiters and waitresses with spoons in their chest pockets.  Curious, she decides when their waiter comes back by, she'll just ask what that's about.\n\nA few minutes later, he comes back with their drinks.  He proceeds to take their appetizer and main dish orders.  As he's about to leave, the women motions for him.  \n\n\"Yes m'am?\" he asks, leaning forward.\n\nShe asks, \"I noticed that every single member of the waitstaff have a spoon in their pockets...\"  She pointed to his.  \"What's with the spoon?\"\n\nHe smiles, and explains that their restaurant had ran through several studies to ensure that the waitstaff is the most efficient they can be, saving the customers and restuarant time and money.  One of the topics dealt with dropped silverwear.  The most commonly dropped piece is the spoon, since it is placed right next to the knife, and usually used last, it tends to get knocked off the table most often.  With that, it saves time and money for the waitstaff to have the spoon ready in-hand to hand to the customer.\n\nShe smiles and thanks him for the explanation, and just as she was reaching for her knife to butter her dinner roll, she just so happened to knock the spoon off the table.  Without missing a beat, the waiter hands her the spoon from his pocket with a smile.  She thanks him, smiling again.\n\nAs he walks away, however, she notices something new.  There was a string hanging from the waiter's fly!  \n\n*How odd...*  She began looking around again, curiously.\n\nShe noticed all the male waitstaff had a string hanging from their pant flys as well.\n\nShe decides it may be another strange way to save money, but will ask later.\n\nAfter dinner, everyone is served apple pie al la mode, and is just finishing up, when the waiter comes back by.  The woman calls him over again.  She asks about the string, pointing somewhat discreetly to it.\n\nHe laughs, and begins explaining that another part of the study dealt with cleanliness, and saving time and money at the same time.  He explained that when the men go to the bathroom, in order to save time and money from washing their hands, they could just unzip their flys and pull on the string, which would pull their penis out and allow them to urinate, all without laying a finger or palm on their privates.\n\nShe blushed, laughing.  \"How odd, but it must be true!  You all have been so quick to serve and everything!\"  The waiter smiled, laughing.  Then he noticed a perplexed look on her face.\n\nShe stared for a second, thinking.  \"Wait, so, if you pull it out using the string, how do you... y'know... get it back in?\"\n\nThe waiter looked around the room, and leaned in to the table.\n\n\"Personally, I use the spoon.\"",

For some reason the cattle will not step on the \"guards,\" probably because they fear getting their feet caught between the rails. \n\n A few months ago, Donald Trump received and was reading a report that there were over 100,000 cattle guards in Colorado . The Colorado ranchers had protested his proposed changes in grazing policies, so he ordered the Secretary of the Interior to fire half of the \"cattle\" guards immediately! \n\n Before the Secretary of the Interior could respond and presumably try to straighten President Trump out on the matter, Vice-President Ben Carson intervened with a request that ... before any \"cattle\" guards were fired, they be given six months of retraining for border guards for the US-Mexico Wall.

They shake, he grabs a cherry and a lowball glass, and sinks the shot his first attempt.\n\n\"I wanna warn you\", he says, pocketing the 5spot the bartender slapped on the counter, \"I am VERY coordinated\". \n\n\"Okay\", says the barkeep, looking down at a regular sitting on the other side of the bar, a woman he knew to be as butch as they come, and not afraid to punch a man. \"Bet you 50 bucks you can't get her phone number\"\n\nThe professional wagerer glances down at her, looks back at the barkeep, and says \"... 20 bucks, I'm a little skeptical of my odds with a woman with a shaved head\". \n\n\"Deal\" says the bartender, watching the wagerer walk over, engage in polite conversation with her for awhile. He watches him do a couple stupid bar tricks, pull a card from behind her ear, and put the charm on hard. He was over there for a good 10 minutes before the wagerer threw up his hands and eventually made his way back to his seat.\n\n\"Well, you've got me. I couldn't get her number, here's your 20\" he said, slapping it on the table. Smiling, the bartender pocketed the cash, and went to fill an order.\n\n\"Wait, I have a wager for you\" said the man, grinning ear to ear. \"I bet you $300\"... he said, counting out crisp twenties and laying them across the bar, \"that I can piss exactly 1 shot into 3 shot glasses, while standing on this barstool, while being slowly spun around, without splashing a drop\". He held his finger to his chin, in thought, and quickly added \"Blindfolded\".\n\nThe bartender looked carefully at the money, and thought it over. Surely there was no way that was possible, he thought, and after deliberation, replied \"You've got yourself a deal.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" said the wagerer. \"I'm gonna need you to help me though. Stand to the side of me here, while I hop on the chair, and spin me around while I piss, okay?\"\n\nThe bartender quickly set three shot glasses on the counter, and walked to the other side of the bar, while the wagerer wrapped a handkerchief around his eyes, grabbed his cock in his left hand, held out his right  hand to stabilize himself, and told the bartender to spin him. He took a few seconds to stabilize himself, as he spun, and loudly declared \"HERE I GO!\"\n\nHe started pissing, and his bladder was clearly full. He started pissing on the floor, then the chair, then the bar, then the chairs, then across the face of the bartender, then again on the chairs. Piss was flying everywhere except for perhaps three or four drops that landed in the shot glasses. After he finished, and shook his cock dry, he lifted one side of the hankie from his eye and said \"Well fuck, guess I lost that one.\"\n\nGrinning ear to ear, and wiping the  piss from himself, the bartender started laughing, uproariously, at the idiotic bet the wagerer made. He walked over to the counter to collect his money, smiling, and turned to see something he didn't expect. The butch girl from the other side of the bar was walking over, slapped the wagerer, and started counting out hundreds from her rhinestone wallet, slapping them unceremoniously into the hands of the betting man.\n\n\"What's got you so worked up, Liz?\" the bartender asked her, still counting out his money.\n\n\"This fucker put the moves on me for a little while before I told him we bat for the same team, then he made a bet with me for a grand that he could, within half an hour, piss all over your face and bar and get you to laugh about it!\"",

The wind was blowing a good bit. The bar was a few blocks from his job. He finally arrived at the bar. He had been here ay least a hundred times. As I said, it was Wednesday, so not many people were there. In fact only two people were in the bar: the Bartender and a strange looking man in the corner. Jim knew the bartender well so he ordered his usual drink, and decided to go sit with the strange man in the corner. As jim walked closer he realized that the man had an Orange for a head! This shocked jim but he didn't want to be rude. So he sat down and started a pretty casual conversation.\nThe man with an Orange for a head eventually acknowledged his strange appearance and told jim that he'd tell his story if he bought him a drink. Jim orders the man a drink, and he begins to tell the story. \"Well, as a young man I found an old lamp in the attic of my first home. As fate would have it, there was a genie in the lamp!\" He was very charismatic. \"Of course he offered me three wishes for setting him free. So, as any young man would do, I wished to be the richest man in the world.\" Jim is awestruck, \"so, you're the richest man in the world?\" \nThe orange man replied, \"Yes, In fact I own this bar. But that's beside the point. I still had two more wishes. For my second wish, I wished that I was the most desirable man on earth. And before you ask jim, yes it came true. It can get pretty annoying.\" Jim just laughed and asked many many questions about what happened afterwards. It carried on late into the evening. The man with an Orange for a head got up to leave, but jim stopped him. \"Wait! What was your third wish?!\" \n\nThe man with an Orange for a head stopped, and looked at Jim for what seemed like an eternity.\n\nThen he finally spoke, \"I wished for an Orange for a head\"",

The little man sits down at the piano and starts playing a beautiful piece by Mozart.\n\u201cWhere on earth did you get that ???\u201d asked the surprised bartender.

Without hesitating he says, \u201cI want a million bucks !\u201d\nA few moments later, a duck walks into the bar. Another duck, then another soon follow it. Pretty soon, the entire bar is filled with ducks and they keep coming!\nThe bartender turns to the man and says, \u201cYou know, I think your genie\u2019s a little deaf. I asked for a million bucks, not a million ducks.\u201d\nThe man replies, \u201cDo you really think I asked for a 12 inch pianist ??? \u201c",

The police then ignore crime around those times and the criminal AI noticed.

Police now shoot people and quit the next morning causing a massive shortage. Another student had a bright idea of having body cameras. Everything was fine for a few simulated days but the police AI noticed if they stand behind a car or some object the camera will pick up it instead of the conflict. Police AI now stand behind cars or trees for a minute or two before shooting civilizations\n\nFrustrated the students asked the computer science student next to them who ran an operating system that was neither windows or mac. They said they think there is a bug in the simulation bc the police won't stop shooting people. The CS student had them explain the problem. After they explained he looked at them like they were idiots. He suggested they **remove** all that crap they added, **remove** the part where police can use a gun on the job and **remove** the gun being part of police uniform/equipment. Let police carry a gun like they can carry dental floss. They have one but isn't considered equipment.\n\nTo everyone's amazement this worked. Now when it's almost lunch or a shift change police just drag people to dark alleys to beat the shit out of them or plant false evidence.

The rich of the world all have mansions and castles on either side of the fairways. \n\n\n\nThe husband is a bit of a worry-wart. So, naturally, on the first hole of the course he's giving his wife tips and encouraging her to drive the ball straight down the fairway. \n\n\"Don't you dare flub your shots dear, if you do and it breaks anything at all we're in so much trouble... We could barely afford the trip let alone damage fees!\"\n\nHe makes the wife nervous and at first she whiffs the ball entirely. After encouragement... She hits the ball hard and drives it, straight into a beautiful stained glass window of a near by mansion.\n\n\"Dammit!\" They both exclaim and start to argue. After bickering for a few minutes they decide they had better walk up to the mansion, apologize, and see if they can work out an arrangement for the damage.\n\nUpon arrival to the mansion they notice the door wide open and a deep, strong voice echoes \"Well... Come in.\"\n\nThey enter the spectacular mansion, and follow the voice I till they come into a room that appears to be a study, there is broken shards of glass everywhere, and halfway across the room is a broken jewel encrusted vase. Standing next to the wreckage is a burly man with thick goatee and fine clothes, holding a golf ball.\n\nThe husband and wife start apologizing profusely and begging to work out an arrangement, but the man hold up his hand for silence, smiles and speaks:\n\n\"Do not worry about the damage, you see you have done me a great service, do you see the jewel encrusted vase that has broken before you? I have lived in that cell for a millennium. It is only thanks to you that I am free. You see I am a genie... And as a reward I may grant three wishes... I only ask you allow me to make the 3rd wish\"\n\nThe husband and wife are astonished and thrilled! The husband walks up to the genie and happily asks for a mansion just as beautiful as this one, in every country in the world. \n\nThe genie nods his head and says \"it is done. There is now a mansion in every part of the world\"\n\nThe wife looks at be the genie and asks for so much money that they never have to work a day in their lives again. And so they can golf here whenever they want.\n\nThe genie nods and says \"it is done, you now can afford all the pleasures in life\"\n\nThe genie then asks for his only wish \"this is my only wish and you must command it for it to come true... I have been locked in that vase, far too long, far too lonely without the comfort of warmth of a beautiful woman such as your wife standing before me... I wish to take this woman to the bedroom upstairs and have my way with her.\"\n\nThe husband and wife are shocked at his wish, and the husbands none to happy but after discussing it for a few minutes, the wife convinces the husband that it's worth it, that after all the wise genie did for them it's the least they can do... \n\nSo with the husbands approval the genie takes the wife upstairs into a beautiful huge bedroom and has incredible sex with with her. Hours pass and they both lay there elated and tired. \n\nThe wife exclaims \"that was incredible...\"\n\nAnd the genie, smoking a cigar, asks \"so how long have you been married?\"\n\n\"A 35 long years\" the wife replies\n\n\"Wow, such a long time for you both, and how old is your husband?\" Asks the genie\n\n\"He just turned 50 last month.. Why do you ask?\" Says the wife\n\nAnd the genie chucked \"amazing, 50 years old and still believes in genies\"\n\n",

To check, I got to my apartment early from work that day, and parked the car a few blocks away to not make noise. I took the elevator up to the third floor, where my place was. I ran, slammed open the door into the apartment, and slammed open the bedroom door. Sure enough, my wife was naked on the bed, but the man was nowhere to be seen. I shouted to her,' Where is that bastard! I'll kill him!' So I went out to try to find him. I checked every room, and when I got back to the bedroom, I saw a pair of hands hanging off the balcony. When I got closer, it was a sweaty, naked man who was holding on. With my anger, I kicked his hands off. He, however, landed in some bushes and was fine, so I unplugged the refrigerator, and dropped it on him. But the stress from moving the refrigerator and the whole incident was just too much, and my hypertension made me burst a blood vessel, and I died.\"\n\nSaint Peter says,\" Alright, fair enough. Let's hear the next man's story.\"\n\nThe second man says,\" Well, I live on the fourth floor of the apartment. I'm a nudist, and I was practicing my Tai Chi out on the balcony, when I accidentally slipped off the balcony. I fell one floor, but managed to hang onto the balcony on the third floor. Before I had a chance to even call for help, an angry looking man came out and kicked my hands off! I luckily landed in the bushes, but so did the refrigerator he sent down. Both the refrigerator and I were completely crushed.\"\n\nSaint Peter tells the second man,\" Well, that certainly does change things.\"\n\nLooking at the third man, Saint Peter asks,\" How did you die?\"\n\nThe man, seemingly confused, says,\" I'm not exactly sure what had happened.

        "body": "Dan liked children. It had always a problem for him, but he kept it to himself, and, until his wife left, he suppressed all feelings about it. After Linda cheated on him with his best friend and abandoned their marriage, Dan was depressed. He spent a couple weeks without seeing anyone, only leaving to get food and other necessities. Dan had a generous boss and took advantage of his numerous vacation days. Eventually, some friends got a hold of him and got him out of the house. All attempts to cheer him up were futile. Strippers and the like had no effect. \nOne day, a family moved in across the street from his two story suburban home. They had a thirteen year old daughter, and, in the pits of Dan's depression, his old desires awakened. He would watch her from his bedroom window, but never fathomed fulfilling his fantasies. \n\nA couple weeks passed before Dan's wife sent him divorce papers from Europe, where she was staying with Chad, Dan's old friend and the Best Man at their wedding. Dan's agony recommenced, and he moved on from only Emily who lived across the street to watching girls coming out of the school, a few blocks over. When steel prices skyrocketed, the automotive industry was hit hard. Dan got laid off. This threw him to rock bottom. He had been gradually coming to terms with his pedophilia and, though a favor from a former coworker, bought a snow-colored van. Dan began driving out to neighborhoods where he wouldn't be recognized and luring girls to climb to his vehicle. He had always been particularly attractive. Despite the weight he had gained since his divorce, convincing young teens to come with him was surprisingly easy. He didn't dare force them to have sex. Touching and groping sufficed for him. However, Dan wasn't very discrete and was apprehended by the police in a matter of weeks.\n\nDan pled guilty, and the judge assigned him a 7 year sentence for his crimes. In jail, he contemplated suicide multiple times, but never had the courage to go through with it. The only thing that moderated his depression was the art classes he chose to take. Dan was surprisingly talented, and the judge who convicted him bought one of his paintings as evidence of the positive effects of the prison system. When he got out, Dan registered as a sex offender, and moved out of state. He had trouble getting a job and was turned down 6 different times because of his history before finding a position at Subway. To keep his spirits up, Dan decided to try to get a girlfriend. He made an online dating profile, but no relationships lasted after they found him on the registry. The longest one he had lasted a month. As a result of pure coincidence, Susan ended it with him on the same day that the Subway franchise Dan that was working at closed down. \n\nDan relapsed into depression, and his pedophilia reignited. He slipped back into the same routine that put him behind bars. Dan found a cheap Chevy Astro in white, and this time he took it further. Unfortunately for him, emotional distress made him sloppier. The police caught him even sooner. Dan found himself in court once again. By pure chance, he was confronted with the same judge from before. The judge's wife had found a better job, which happened to be in the same state Dan took up residence in. Her husband moved with her, knowing that he could find a similar position in any city. When Dan stepped into his courtroom, the judge was surprised. He had bought Dan's impressionist painting, and recognized the man he had convicted. He cried out: \n\"DAMN, DANIEL BACK AT IT AGAIN WITH THE WHITE VANS\"",

He said they were scaring their kids. The preacher said they were having the same issue, in fact, a few of the squirrels had actually gotten inside of the church and had done some damage to the roof. The Imam agreed saying that in fact one of the squirrels had bitten a few people at the mosque. The Priest then spoke up and said they used to have the same issue but had solved it. He said they took all of their squirrels, Baptized them, confirmed them, and now they only come around on Christmas and Easter. ",

This can take anywhere from 30 sec. to 15 min., depending on the woman and the situation.\n\n* Read her mind to determine when she's ready.\n\n* Now you can move your fingers down south.\n\n* But some women don't like that, in which case you should use your tongue instead.\n\n* But this maneuver might make her terribly self-conscious, in which case you'll ruin everything. \n\n* Read her mind to determine which course of action to pursue.\n\n* Now, if using your fingers, read her mind to determine how many fingers to utilize. \n\n* The preferred number is different for each \nwoman, though getting this wrong can be catastrophic.\n\n* Gently caress her.\n\n* But don't be too gentle, you'll bore her.\n\n* But don't be too rough, you'll hurt her.\n\n* Alternate clitoral caressing and penetration with a frequency determined by Schrodinger in the 1942 Vienna experiments.\n\n* If using your tongue, follow the above steps with the obvious alterations.\n\n* Eventually, she'll be sufficiently lubed for you to penetrate her with your penis.\n\n* When penetrating her, start with gentle, slow thrusts.\n\n* But not too gentle and slow. Remember, a woman isn't stimulated as easily as is a man.\n\n* Generate some significant friction.\n\n* But not too much friction. This isn't a porno, and you don't need a hospital bill.\n\n* Gradually increase your frequency of thrusting.\n\n* Read your woman's mind to determine the preferred acceleration. Remember, this is rocket science.\n\n* Magically bend your penis upward at a 45 degree angle to stimulate the G spot.\n\n* IMPORTANT: Do not finish before her. This means that you'll have to enjoy the stimulation as little as possible until she's climaxed. \n\n* You'll find that, if you're good at this, you will be able to essentially numb your own pelvic sensations.\n\n* After she's climaxed, and now that you're good and numb to the sensations, you'll have to (by some physiological miracle) enjoy the \nstimulation again so as to finish yourself.\n\n* You must finish. Remember, if she doesn't climax, it's your fault, and if you don't climax, it's your fault.\n\n**How To Please A Man**\n\n* Touch his dick.",

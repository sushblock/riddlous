The only other passengers were members of a high school hockey team. \n\nAfter 100 miles on the road, the bus breaks down and everyone has to get off the bus while it is repaired. While the man and woman wait, the man suggests the two go off into the woods and have a little fun since the bus won't leave for another hour. She is flattered, but says: \"I think we should wait,\" and so they get back on the bus. \n\nAfter another hundred miles, the bus breaks down again. Everyone gets off the bus and waits for it to be repaired. Again, the man asks his girlfriend to sneak off while they wait. \"How about now?\" he asks. \"This journey is taking forever and I cannot wait any longer!\" Flattered, she insists they wait until they arrive in Minnesota. Everyone soon gets back on the bus. \n\nFor a third time, the bus breaks down. The man figures it is not worth bothering his girlfriend a third time. \"She might become annoyed and not want to marry me,\" he thinks. Suddenly, she takes his hand, brings him into the woods and she experiences her first time. \n\nAs they are walking back to the bus, the man cannot help but say: \"That was wonderful. You are a skillful lover! But what made you change your mind about having your first time after the wedding?\"\n\nThe women looks at him and says: \"Well, the hockey team said 'By the time we get to Minnesota, the fucking season would be over.'\"",

After a few hours of playing with the Bird in the Living Room their father comes home just in time to catch the big Football game, the two sons go outside to play catch.\n\nWhile outside the one son throws the ball a little too hard and it smashes through the living room window, the Dad goes to the window and screams \"If that shit would of hit me, I would of fucked you up!\" the boys were sent to bed early.\n\nThe Dad goes back to watching his game, just as his least favorite player got the ball and starting running he yells at his TV \"Fly Nigga Fly!\" His team eventually won and the Dad goes to bed.\n\nThe following Sunday the Family was going to take the Bird to the Vet to get checked out, so they figured they would bring the Bird to Church and head straight to the Vet afterwards.\n\nWhile at the Church the Bird starts acting up, so the Priest throws a book at the bird. The bird then screams \"If that shit would of hit me, I would of Fucked you up!\" The Priest is appalled by the birds reaction, he says to the bird \"How do you expect to get into Heaven with that mouth?\" the Bird replies \"Fly Nigga Fly!\"",

The\nman yells, \"Here is my membership card, you can have the key back, \nand you can keep the $500 membership fee.\" \"But sir,\" she replies, \"you've only been here for a few hours, you haven't even had the\nchance to see all our facilities.\" The man replies, \"Listen lady,\nI'm 58 years old, I get a hard-on once a month, but I fart 15 times\na day!\"",

At the end of the match was an advertisement. \nA loud, obnoxious character came on screaming about $10,000 dollars in\nprize money for anyone who could defeat \"The Killer\".\n\nJake looked at Bubba, a 6' 4\" giant with a brain the size of a pea,\nand got an idea. He told Bubba, \"I bet you could beat that guy. He\ndoesn't look so rough, and you're no wimp.\" Bubba thought about it for\na minute and agreed that he probably could.\n\nThe next weekend Jake and Bubba went down to the stadium where the\ntournament was being held and signed Bubba up. An old man came over\nand started briefing them on the rules of the contest and such. Jake,\nseeing Bubba was a bit nervous, asked the old man for any tips. The\nold man looked up to Bubba and said, \"Just you watch out for his\npretzel hold. Ain't nobody ever gotten out that thing.\"\nOne by one, the contestants ahead of Bubba went in and came back,\nballed up and hurting. Two hours after they arrived, it was finally\nBubba's turn. In the ring, right before the bell rang,\n\nBubba looked back at Jake and said, \"Don't worry, buddy. I can avoid\nthat pretzel thing.\" But not ten seconds after he had gotten up in\nthe ring, The Killer laying on top of the contorted ball of Bubba, and\nthe referee was pounding the mat, counting to ten.\n\nJake screamed and started walking back to the locker rooms. He was\npissed. He had just shelled out $500 to get Bubba in this contest,\nand it didn't last 20 seconds. But right before he got to the door,\nthe crowd went wild! Jake ran back to the ring to see Bubba with one\nfoot on top of the unconscious Killer and one arm raised in the air by\nthe referee. Jake ran into the ring and jumped on Bubba. The crowd was out of control, and Jake and Bubba were $10,000 richer!\n\nLater in the locker room, Jake confessed to Bubba that he didn't see what had happened. Bubba said, \"Well, The Killer got me in his pretzel\nhold and I thought all was lost. I hurt like I'd never hurt before,\nand all I could hear was the ref slamming his hand down and counting to ten. Then I looked up, and front of me was this big, hairy sack of balls. I had nothing to lose and figured it might even help. So I\nstretched a little further and bit down as hard as I could on those\nthings.\"\n\n\"Jake,\" Bubba said. \"You wouldn't believe the strength a man gets\nwhen he bites down on his own balls!\"\n",

The man thanked him and asked \"I'm sorry but I have to ask, what was that beautiful noise I heard last night?\" the head monk apologized to the man and explained once again \"I am sorry, but I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk.\" the man tried again and again but the monk told him once again that he could not tell him. The man was disappointed and slightly angered but moved on with his life and decided to go home. As the man opened his car door he turned around and knocked on the door again.\n\nThe head monk answered \"Yes my child?\" and the man said that he had to know what the noise was. The monk explained once again \"I'm sorry but I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk.\" The man would not take no for an answer this time and asked the head monk what it would take to become a monk. The head monk told the man to go out and count every blade of grass on earth. And the man looked at the head monk and decided it was worth it.\n\nFor 10 long years the man traveled the world counting every blade of grass. He counted in yards, he looked in fields, and he even found some in laboratories. Sometimes the wind would blow and he'd have to start all over again and sometimes people would be mowing the grass and he'd get confused by the clippings. The man eventually found what he was sure was the correct number of blades of grass on Earth.\n\nThe man returned to the monastery and knocked on the door, the head monk answered the door \"Yes my child?\" the man handed the monk the count of the blades of grass and the monk looked over it and said \"Yes my child, you are correct.\" The man jumped for joy and asked \"So I'm a monk now?\" and the monk said \"No my child, I am sorry but you are not yet a monk, first you must count every grain of sand on Earth.\"\n\nFor 10 long years the man traveled the world counting every grain of sand. He counted in sandboxes, he looked in the vast deserts, and he even looked at the golf courses. Sometimes the wind would blow and he'd have to start all over again and sometimes the water would wash away the sand at the beaches. The man eventually found what he was sure was the correct number of grains of sand on Earth.\n\nThe man returned to the monastery and knocked on the door, the head monk answered the door \"Yes my child?\" the man handed the monk the count of the grains of sand and the monk looked over it and said \"Yes my child, you are correct.\" The man jumped for joy and asked \"So I'm a monk now?\" and the monk said \"No my child, I am sorry but you are not yet a monk, first you must count all the stars in the sky.\" The man was angry, but decided it was worth it.\n\nFor 10 long years the man traveled the world counting every star in the sky. He counted every night. Sometimes he would lose track and sometimes he'd fall asleep. The man eventually found what he was sure was the correct number of stars in the sky.\n\nThe man returned to the monastery and knocked on the door, the head monk answered the door \"Yes my child?\" the man handed the monk the count of the blades of grass and the monk looked over it and said \"Yes my child, you are correct.\" The man jumped for joy and asked \"So I'm a monk now?\" and the monk said \"Yes my child.\" The man asked \"Well what is the beautiful noise?\" the monk told him that the noise is behind the large wooden door in the main hall.\n\nThe man went to the door and pulled on the door for hours, then the door popped slightly open. The man continued to pull on the door for 3 days and then the wooden door opened.\n\nHe looked inside and saw a larger bronze door. He began pulling on the bronze door and after the man pulled on the door for a week it creaked open slightly, he kept pulling on the door for a month at the end of the month the door was open enough for him to slip through.\n\nHe looked inside and saw an even larger silver door. He began pulling on the silver door and after the man pulled on the door for a month and it creaked open slightly, he kept pulling on the door for a year at the end of the year the door was open enough for him to slip through.\n\nHe looked inside and saw a still larger gold steel door. He began pulling on the steel door and after the man pulled on the door for a year it creaked open slightly, he kept pulling on the door for years and years at the end of the decade the door was open enough for him to slip through.\n\nHe looked inside and saw an incredibly large golden door. He began pulling on the gold door and after the man pulled on the door for a decade it creaked open slightly, after all of this a crowd began to form, wanting to see the man pulling on the door forever. He kept pulling on the door for 20 long years and eventually door was open enough for him to get through and it swung smoothly out the rest of the way.\n\nAnd then he saw what was making the beautiful noise.\n\n-------\n\nOh, I guess you want me to tell you what made the beautiful noise. But I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk.\n\n",

Meanwhile, Rude, an apparent devout Christian in real life is in the back seat turning red.

He apologizes, \"I'm sorry Rick. I had no idea you felt so strongly about religion. I was just shootin' the breeze, trying to have fun, but if it offends you, I will not say that phrase again.\"\n\nRude says \"Thank you very much Steve.\"\n\n\"Well you're god damn welcome.\"",

My prospective sister-in-law was twenty years of age, wore tight mini skirts and low cut blouses. She would regularly bend down when near me and I got many a pleasant view of her underwear. It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was near anyone else. \n\nOne day little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived. She whispered to me that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome. \n\nShe told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. I was in total shock and couldn't say a word. She said, \"I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me.\" I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house. \n\nI walked straight towards my car, My future father-in-law was standing outside.

The light goes on, he offers to give he another $200 for the answer.  \"My little secret!\" The stripper says.\n\nNow the man is angry.  he's being made a fool, he thinks to himself.  So he goes back the next day, angrily hands her $200, and says \"The Secret!\"  Back to the room they go.  But he has a plan this time, you see.  Same story- lights go off, she starts blowing him, and she starts singing Moon River.  As soon as she starts, though, he flips the light on.\n\nAnd there, sitting on the table next to them, was a glass eye. ",

Patricia's bemusement grows: \"I'm not sure that we can accept this, do you have any other form of collateral?\" The frog appears mildly frustrated: \"Come on, my father is Mick Jagger and all I want is a \u00a310,000 loan.\" So Patricia excuses herself and goes in search of the manager, when she finds him she explains the rather bizarre occurrences: \"There's this frog asking me for a loan and he's given me this small, shiny, pink elephant as collateral \u2013 what am I supposed to do!?!\" To this the manager replies: \"It's a nick nack, Patty Wack. Give the frog a loan. His old man is a rolling stone.\"",

For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span.\"\nThe monkey said, \"Monkey tricks for twenty years? That's a pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the dog did?\"And God agreed.\n\nOn the third day, God created the cow and said,  \"You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years.\"\nThe cow said, \"That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?\"\nAnd God agreed again. \n\nOn the fourth day, God created humans and said, \"Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life.

The whole scene was just all played out for them.\n\nBy chance, Stallone had with him a script that his agent had given to him kind of as a joke.  The script would allow three actors to act out the role of their favorite musical composer.  The three men were delighted, \"This is great! Nobody would ever expect this from us! Let's do it!\"  And so the agreement was made. Soon, a big budget studio was attached to the project, Spielberg signed on to direct, everything was falling into place.\n\nOn the day of the first pre-production meeting, the actors realized they needed to pick parts. Since Stallone had proposed the idea, he got to choose first.  After thinking for a minute, he declared \"I want to be Beethoven.\" The others agreed to let Stallone have Beethoven.\n\nNext, it was Van Dam's turn.  He thought for a moment, then declared, \"I want to play Mozart.\" And the others agreed to that as well.\n\nFinally, it was Arnold Schwarzenegger's turn.

Little Johnny exits to find Dad, searching more of his large house. Eventually, he makes it to their maid's bedroom. Looking through the keyhole, he sees Dad \"doing\" the maid.

Inevitably though, one thought led to another, and soon I was more than just a social thinker.\n\nI began to think alone - \"to relax,\" I told myself - but I knew it wasn't true. Thinking became more and more important to me, and finally I was thinking all the time.\n\nI began to think on the job. I knew that thinking and employment don't mix, but I couldn't stop myself.\n\nI began to avoid friends at lunchtime so I could read Thoreau and Kafka. I would return to the office dizzied and confused, asking, \"What is it exactly we are doing here?\"\n\nThings weren't going so great at home either. One evening I had turned off the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life. She spent that night at her mother's.\n\nI soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker. One day the boss called me in. He said, \"Skippy, I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but your thinking has become a real problem. If you don't stop thinking on the job, you'll have to find another job.\" This gave me a lot to think about.\n\nI came home early after my conversation with the boss. \"Honey,\" I confessed, \"I've been thinking...\"\n\n\"I know you've been thinking,\" she said, \"and I want a divorce!\"\n\n\"But Honey, surely it's not that serious.\"\n\n\"It is serious,\" she said, lower lip aquiver. \"You think as much as college professors, and college professors don't make any money, so if you keep on thinking we won't have any money!\"\n\n\"That's a faulty syllogism,\" I said impatiently, and she began to cry. I'd had enough. \"I'm going to the library,\" I snarled as I stomped out the door.\n\nI headed for the library, in the mood for some Nietzsche, with a PBS station on the radio. I roared into the parking lot and ran up to the big glass doors... they didn't open. The library was closed.\n\nTo this day, I believe that a Higher Power was looking out for me that night.\n\nAs I sank to the ground clawing at the unfeeling glass, whimpering for Zarathustra, a poster caught my eye. \"Friend, is heavy thinking ruining your life?\" it asked. You probably recognize that line. It comes from the standard Thinker's Anonymous poster.\n\nWhich is why I am what I am today: a recovering thinker. I never miss a TA meeting. At each meeting we watch a non-educational video; last week it was \"Porky's.\" Then we share experiences about how we avoided thinking since the last meeting.\n\nI still have my job, and things are a lot better at home. Life just seemed... easier, somehow, as soon as I stopped thinking. \n\nAnd today I joined the Democratic party!\n",

        "body": "  A rabbit was sitting in the forest straining to expel the demons caused from a bad meal he had eaten the night before, when he heard a rustling in the bush not far from him. Knowing he was near the bottom of the food chain, he tried to hurry it up.\n\n  Just as the rabbit finished his business, a bear stuck his head through the bush and immediately saw him. Both of them were off like lightening, the rabbit trying to save his fur and the bear trying to land an 'easy meal'. Through the forest the rabbit ran, darting left and dodging right with the bear close in tow at every turn. As the bear closed the gap and started closing in to catch his meal, they ran into an open field and bounded over a slender creek. No sooner were they over the creek when they heard a deep and throaty \"STOP!!\"\n\n  Not used to hearing such a sound, they both come to a screeching halt, tumbling over each other. On the bank of the creek was the largest bull frog either of them had ever seen.\n\n  The frog spoke again and said \"You two are pretty loud, running around. Normally I would be annoyed because I was napping in the sun, but you two saved my life from the hawk that was going to snatch me by waking me up.\"\n\n  \"Umm...your welcome?\" uttered the bear, keeping an eye on what would still hopefully be his next meal. \n\n  \"It just so happens I am a wish granting genie and while I am on hiatus, I feel I owe you both for saving my life. I will grant you both three wishes, in succession of course, as a means of gratitude. Ok, who is going first?\"\n\n  The bear, unable to contain his excitement, jumped in front of the rabbit and managed to yelp out \"ME, ME!!\" \n\n  \"Ok bear, what will it be?\"\n\n  \"Mating season is tough, with all the competition. I think if you could make all the bears in this forest female, except for me, that would make things easier.\"\n\n  \"Done,\" claimed the frog. \"Now rabbit, what can I grant for you?\"\n\n  \"I want a helmet,\" he stated, matter-of-factly. The frog, having heard very odd requests in his time, granted the wish with barely a second thought.\n\n  \"Ok bear, time for your second wish. What will it be?\".\n\n  \"Oh man, I thought about it and realized it would be easier if all the bears in the surrounding forests where female too!\" he exclaimed.\n\n  \"Nice wish,\" and with that, the frog made it so. He turned back to the rabbit, asking \"what is your next wish?\"\n\n  \"I want a motorcycle.\" The frog and the bear looked at each other and exchanged a 'WTF' look. True to his word though, the frog granted the outlandish wish.\n\n  \"Alright bear, you have been on a roll today. What is your last wish?\"\n\n  \"Wow, I feel like I wasted my first two but this last one will make up for it. I WISH ALL THE BEARS IN THE WORLD WERE FEMALE!...except for me of course.\"\n\n  With the same amount of fervor and excitement the frog exclaimed \"DONE!\" Looking back to the rabbit, feeling a bit annoyed, the frog asked \"What else could you possibly want?\" \n\n   The rabbit strapped on his helmet, jumped on the motorcycle, looked straight in the bears face and yelled \"I WISH THE BEAR WAS GAY!\" and was out of sight before either of them knew what had happened. \n\n",

For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years.\"\n\nThe cow said, \"That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years.  How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?\"\n\nAnd God agreed again......\nOn the fourth day, God created humans and said, \"Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life.  For this, I'll give you twenty years.\"\n\nBut the human said, \"Only twenty years?  Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?\"\n\n\"Okay,\" said God.  \"You asked for it.\"\n\nSo that is why for our first twenty years, we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves.  For the next forty years, we slave in the sun to support our family.  For the next ten years, we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren.  And for the last ten years, we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.\n\nLife has now been explained to you.\n\n",

Used to five-star hotels, this guy has no idea what to do, so for the next four months he eats bananas, drinks coconut juice and longs for his old life. He fixes his gaze on the sea, hoping to spot a rescue ship.\n\nOne day, as he is lying on the beach, he spots a movement out of the corner of his eye. It's a rowboat, and in it is the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen. She rows up to him.\n\nIn disbelief, he asks her, 'Where did you come from? How did you get here?'\n\n'I rowed from the other side of the island,' she says. 'I landed here when my cruise ship sank.'\n\n'Amazing,' he says. 'I didn't know anyone else had survived. How many are there? You were lucky to have a rowboat wash up with you.'\n\n'It's only me,' she says, 'and the rowboat didn't wash up; nothing did.'\n\nHe is confused. 'Then how did you get the rowboat?'\n\n'Oh, simple,' replies the woman. 'I made the rowboat out of materials that I found on the island. I whittled the oars from the gumtree branches. I wove the bottom from palm branches and the sides and stern came from a coconut tree.'\n\n'B-b-but that's impossible,' stutters the man. 'You had no tools or hardware. How did you manage?'\n\n'Oh, that was no problem,' replies the woman. 'On the other side of the island there is a very unusual stratum of alluvial rock exposed. I found that if I fired it to a certain temperature in my kiln, it melted into the forgeable ductile iron. I used that for tools and used the tools to make the hardware. But enough of that,' she says. 'Where do you live?'\n\nSheepishly, he confesses that he has been sleeping on the beach the whole time. \n\n'Well, let's row over to my place then,' she says.\n\nAfter a few minutes of rowing she docks the boat at a small wharf. As the man looks to the shore he nearly falls out of the boat. Before him is a stone walk leading to an exquisite bungalow painted in blue and white. While the woman ties up the rowboat with an expertly woven hemp rope, the man can only state ahead, dumbstruck. As they walk into the house, she says casually, 'It's not much, but I call it home. Sit down, please; would you like a drink?'\n\n'No, no thank you,' he says, still dazed. 'I can't take any more coconut juice.'\n\n'It's not coconut juice,' the woman replies. 'I have a still. How about a pina colada?'\n\nTrying to hide his amazement, the man accepts, and they sit down on her couch to talk.\n\nAfter they have exchanged their stories, the woman announces, 'I'm going to slip into something comfortable. Would you like to take a shower and shave?' There is a razor upstairs in the cabinet in the bathroom.'\n\nNo longer questioning anything, the man goes into the bathroom. There in the cabinet is a razor made from a bone handle. Two shells honed to a hollow ground edge are fastened onto its end inside a swivel mechanism.\n\n'This woman is amazing,' he muses. 'What next?'\n\nWhen he returns, she greets him wearing nothing but vines - strategically positioned - and smelling faintly of gardenias. She beckons him over to sit down next o her.\n\n'Tell me,' she begins, suggestively, slithering closer to him, 'we have been out here for a very long time. You've been lonely. There's something I'm sure you really feel like doing right now, something you've been longing for all these months. You know...'\n\nShe stares into his eyes.

When they wake up, phone calls are made, and they decide that they will tell their prof. about the weekend road trip, but tell him that they got a flat on the way home on Sunday afternoon, didn't have a spare, and could not get back in time for the exam, since there were no tire shops open to fix their flat. \nSo, they all troop down to the prof's office, tell him their tale of woe, and ask to be allowed to write the exam the next day. The Prof agrees to let them, and they head home feeling pretty good.\nTuesday morning comes around, and the buddies show up for their exam. The prof sets them up in four separate study rooms, and gives them each a test. The first page is some pretty basic multiple choice questions, worth 10%.

        "body": "Around age 10 my dad got me one of those little badass compound bow beginner kits. Of course, the first month I went around our land sticking arrows in anything that could get stuck by an arrow. Did you know that a 1955 40 horse Farmall tractor tire will take 6 rounds before it goes down? Tough sumbich.\n\n   That got boring, so being the 10 yr. old Dukes of Hazard fan that I was, I quickly advanced to taking strips of cut up T-shirt doused in chainsaw gas tied around the end and was sending flaming arrows all over the place.\n\n   One summer afternoon, I was shooting flaming arrows into a large rotten oak stump in our backyard. I looked over under the carport and see a shiny brand new can of starting fluid (Ether). The light bulb went off in my head.\n\n   I grabbed the can and set it on the stump. I thought that it would probably just spray out in a disappointing manner. Lets face it, to a 10 yr old mouth-breather like myself, (Ether), really doesn't \"sound\" flammable.\n\n  So, I went back into the house and got a 1 pound can of pyrodex (black powder for muzzle loader rifles).\n\n   At this point, I set the can of ether on the stump and opened up the can of black powder. My intentions were to sprinkle a little bit around the (Ether) can but it all sorta dumped out on me. No biggie, a 1 lb. pyrodex and 16 oz (Ether) should make a loud pop, kinda like a firecracker you know?   You know what? Screw that I'm going back in the house for the other can.\n\n   Yes, I got a second can of pyrodex and dumped it too. Now we're cookin'.  I stepped back about 15 ft and lit the 2 stroke arrow. I drew the nock to my cheek and took aim. As I released I heard a clunk as the arrow launched from my bow. In a slow motion time frame, I turned to see my dad getting out of the truck... OH SHOOT! He just got home from work. So help me God it took 10 minutes for that arrow to go from my bow to the can. My dad was walking towards me in slow motion with a WTF look in his eyes. I turned back towards my target just in time to see the arrow pierce the starting fluid can right at the bottom. Right through the main pile of pyrodex and into the can. Oh shoot.\n\n  When the shock wave hit it knocked me off my feet. I don't know if it was the actual compression wave that threw me back or just reflex jerk back from 235 fricking decibels of sound. I caught a half a millisecond glimpse of the violence during the initial explosion and I will tell you there was dust, grass, and bugs all hovering 1 ft above the ground as far as I could see. It was like a little low to the ground layer of dust fog full of grasshoppers, spiders, and a worm or two.\n\n   The daylight turned purple. Let me repeat this... THE FRICKING DAYLIGHT TURNED PURPLE.\n\n  There was a big sweetgum tree out by the gate going into the pasture. Notice I said \"was\". That son-of-a-bitch got up and ran off.\n\n   So here I am, on the ground blown completely out of my shoes with my thundercats T-Shirt shredded, my dad is on the other side of the carport having what I can only assume is a Vietnam flashback: ECHO BRAVO CHARLIE YOU'RE BRINGIN' EM IN TOO CLOSE!! CEASE FIRE. DAMN IT CEASE FIRE!!!!!\n\n   His hat has blown off and is 30 ft behind him in the driveway. All windows on the north side of the house are blown out and there is a slow rolling mushroom cloud about 2000 ft. over our backyard. There is a Honda 185 3 wheeler parked on the other side of the yard and the fenders are drooped down and are now touching the tires.\n\n   I wish I knew what I said to my dad at this moment. I don't know - I know I said something. I couldn't hear. I couldn't hear inside my own head. I don't think he heard me either... not that it would really matter. I don't remember much from this point on. I said something, felt a sharp pain, and then woke up later. I felt a sharp pain, blacked out, woke later....repeat this process for an hour or so and you get the idea. I remember at one point my mom had to give me CPR. and Dad screaming \"Bring him back to life so I can kill him again\". Thanks Mom.\n\n   One thing is for sure... I never had to mow around that stump again, Mom had been bitching about that thing for years and dad never did anything about it. I stepped up to the plate and handled business.\n\n   Dad sold his muzzle loader a week or so later. I still have some sort of bone growth abnormality, either from the blast or the beating, or both.\n\n   I guess what I'm trying to say is, get your kids into archery. It's good discipline and will teach them skills they can use later on in life.\n",

As soon as she felt her dress move, the woman turned around and punched me right in the eye!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOuch!\u201d said Juan. \u201cThat must have hurt! But how did you come by the second black eye?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell Juan, the very next Sunday I returned to church.  This time I took my cousin Manny with me.  Sure enough, the same woman was sitting directly in front of us.  I promised myself that no matter what happened I was not going to let last week\u2019s incident happen again.  The pastor told us to stand up, we stood up.  He told us to sit down, we sat down.  After some time he told us to stand up and sure enough that women\u2019s dress had migrated back into her ass crack.  Before I could say anything my cousin Manny reached up and plucked the dress from its prison!  Quick as lightning I extended my hand and shoved that dress right back where it came from, shouting \u2018Put it back in!\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRoberto, I need to find a new church. I\u2019m not allowed back there anymore.\u201d\n",

Then the door bell rang. Her mother told her to go open the door and welcome the thanksgiving guests. The little girl walked up, opened the door and said: \"Hello everyone!

The baby balloon tries to get into bed, but mummy balloon and daddy balloon are just so big that he can't squeeze in. So, he goes to daddy balloon, unties his knot and lets out a little air, and tries getting into bed again: Still not enough room. He then goes to mummy balloon and unties her knot and lets a little air out: A little better, but still not enough. So, he unties his own knot, lets out some air, and is able to fit comfortably into bed.\nThe next morning, baby balloon wakes up to find his parents are not there. He goes into the kitchen to find mummy and daddy balloon sitting at the table looking pretty angry.\nDaddy balloon says, 'Son, we are pretty upset about what you did last night.

        "body": "Once there was a man named Zade Zazinski.  Zade was always last for everything due to his name.  Everything always seemed to run out before Zade received his portion.  Schoolbooks, supplies, food rations.  Disappointed, Zade joined the military out of high school thinking that he would be treated equally by the armed forces.  \n\n\nOnce he arrived at basic training things did not go as planned. He went to the rifle range on his first day.  His drill sergeant told him, \u201cSorry Zazinski, we\u2019ve run out of rifles. You\u2019ll just have to pretend out there.\u201d Since Zade had so much practice at making due with what he had, he went with it.  Zade stepped up to the firing line, held an imaginary rifle up and said, \u201cBang. Bang. Bang.\u201d   The next day he received a certificate for good marksmanship.\n\n\nThe following day\u2019s training consisted of learning how to use a bayonet.  Again, the drill sergeant said, \u201cSorry Zazinski. We\u2019ve run out of bayonets, you\u2019ll just have to pretend.\u201d  So again, Zade stepped up to the hanging dummy and screamed \u201cStab. Stab. Stab.\u201d The next day he received commendations for good bayonetsmanship.\n\n\nOn the third day the group headed to the grenade range.  Again the drill sergeant said, \u201cZazinski, we have no more grenades. You\u2019ll just have to pretend out there.\u201d  So Zade threw imaginary grenades while making explosion sounds, \u201cBrooosh. Kerpow. Shblaam.\u201d The next day he received high honors for good grenade throwing.\n\n\nSoon after, Zade was deployed to war.  With the honors he received at basic, Zazinski hoped he would be the dependable soldier they needed on the warfront.  Deep down he knew it would happen, but Zazinski was still disappointed to learn that there was not enough equipment to go around.  Again he was told to just pretend.  \n\n\nZade is sent to the front lines.  He sees the enemy soldiers in the distance.  Grabbing his rifle, Zade took aim and said, \u201cBang. Bang. Bang.\u201d Three enemy soldiers fell over dead.  \n\n\nAs they advanced further, Zade pulled the fake pins from his faux grenades and lobbed them at the enemy saying, \u201cBroosh. Kerpow. Shblaam.\u201d Giant explosions tore through the enemy, killing at least 20 combatants.  \n\n\nSoon the enemy was close enough to require close combat.  Once again, Zade reacted by attaching his bayonet and screaming, \u201cStab. Stab. Stab.\u201d  Anyone who got close fell with knife wounds in their bodies.\n\n\nZade continued to use his fake weaponry to decimate the battlefield.  Shouts of \u201cBang, Stab, Broosh,\u201d echoed across the wasteland that was the warzone.  Enemy soldiers fell left and right.  It seemed that no one was safe from the onslaught of Zazinski.  Casualties piled up until finally, there were only two people left; Zazinski, and an enemy soldier who marched directly at him.\n\n\n\u201cBang. Bang. Bang.\u201d said Zade, but nothing happened.\n\n\n\n\u201cBroosh. Kerpow. Shblaam.\u201d Again, nothing.\n\n\n\nSoon the enemy was within bayonet range.\n\n\n\n\u201cStab. Stab. Stab.\u201d \n\n\n\nNothing.\n\n\n\nWith a look of disbelief Zazinski fell underneath the relentless forward march of the enemy soldier.\n\n\n\nZade had just enough time to look the soldier over, noticing the name tag reading \u2018Zembrowski,\u2019 and to hear the final words of his life spoken by the enemy:\n\n\n\u201cTank. Tank. Tank.\u201d\n",

He strikes up a conversation and eventually asks the hooker; \u201cHow much do you charge?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt starts at $500 for a hand-job,\u201d replies the hooker.\n\n\u201c$500 dollars? For a hand-job?\u201d says the guy \u201cNo hand-job is worth that kind of money!\u201d\n\nSo the hooker says, \u201cDo you see that Denny\u2019s on the corner?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you see the Denny\u2019s about a block further down?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd beyond that, do you see that third Denny\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says the hooker, smiling invitingly, \u201cI own those. And, I own them because I give a hand-job that\u2019s worth $500.\u201d\n\nThe guy thinks to himself, \u201cWhat the hell? You only live once. I\u2019ll give it a try.\u201d and accepts the hooker\u2019s offer. They retire to a nearby motel. A short time later, the guy is sitting on the bed realising that he just experienced the hand-job of a lifetime, worth every bit of $500. He is so amazed, he says, \u201cI suppose a blow-job is $1,000?\u201d\n\n\u201c$1,500\u2033 says the hooker\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t pay that for a blow-job!\u201d he says\n\nThe hooker replies, \u201cStep over here to the window, big boy. Do you see that casino just across the street? I own that casino outright. And I own it because I give a blow-job that\u2019s worth every cent of $1,500.\u201d\n\nThe guy, basking in the afterglow of that terrific hand-job, decides to put off the new car for another year or so, and says, \u201cOK Sign me up.\u201d\n\nTen minutes later, he is sitting on the bed more amazed than before. He can scarcely believe it, but he feels he truly got his money\u2019s worth. He decides to dip into the retirement savings for one glorious and unforgettable experience. He asks the hooker, \u201cHow much for some pussy?\u201d\n\nThe hooker says, \u201cCome over here to the window, I want to show you something. Do you see how the whole city of Las Vegas is laid out before us, all those beautiful lights, gambling palaces, and showplaces?\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn!\u201d the guy says, in awe, \u201cYou own the whole city?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d says the hooker, \u201cbut I would if I had a pussy.\u201d\n\n\nSource: http://www.1500dollarblowjob.com",

Is there an average price?\n\nClerk: Our lowest price is $12 a gallon, and we have 60 differentprices up to $200 a gallon.\n\nCustomer: What's the difference in the paint?\n\nClerk: Oh, there isn't any difference; it's all the same paint.\n\nCustomer: Well, then I'd like some of that $12 paint.\n\nClerk: When do you intend to use the paint?\n\nCustomer: I want to paint tomorrow. It's my day off.\n\nClerk: Sir, the paint for tomorrow is the $200 paint.\n\nCustomer: When would I have to paint to get the $12 paint?\n\nClerk: You would have to start very late at night in about 3weeks. But you will have to agree to start painting before Friday of thatweek and continue painting until at least Sunday.\n\nCustomer: You've got to be *...%^#@* kidding!\n\nClerk: I'll check and see if we have any paint available.\n\nCustomer: You have shelves FULL of paint! I can see it!\n\nClerk: But it doesn't mean that we have paint available. We sellonly a certain number of gallons on any given weekend. Oh, and by theway, the price per gallon just went to $16. We don't have any more $12paint.\n\nCustomer: The price went up as we were talking?\n\nClerk: Yes, sir. We change the prices and rules hundreds oftimes a day, and since you haven't actually walked out of the store with yourpaint yet, we just decided to change. I suggest you purchase your paint assoon as possible. How many gallons do you want?\n\nCustomer: Well, maybe five gallons. Make that six, so I'll haveenough.\n\nClerk: Oh no, sir, you can't do that. If you buy paint and don'tuse it, there are penalties and possible confiscation of the paint youalready have.\n\nCustomer: WHAT?\n\nClerk: We can sell enough paint to do your kitchen, bathroom,hall and north bedroom, but if you stop painting before you do thebedroom, you will lose your remaining gallons of paint.\n\nCustomer: What does it matter whether I use all the paint? IAlready paid you for it!\n\nClerk: We make plans based upon the idea thatall our paint is used, every drop. If you don't, it causes us all sorts ofproblems.\n\nCustomer: This is crazy!! I suppose something terrible happensif I don't keep painting until after Saturday night!\n\nClerk: Oh yes! Every gallonyou bought automatically becomes the $200 paint.\n\nCustomer: But what are all these \"Paint on sale from $10 alitre\" signs?\n\nClerk: Well that's for our budget paint. It only comes in half-gallons. One $5 half-gallon will do half a room. The second half-gallon tocomplete the room is $20. None of the cans have labels,some are empty and there are norefunds, even on the empty cans.\n\nCustomer: I can't believe this! I'll buy what I need somewhereelse!\n\nClerk: I don't think so, sir. You may be able to buy paint forYour bathroom and bedrooms, and your kitchen and dining room fromsomeone else, but you won't be able to paint your connecting hall and stairwayfrom anyone but us. And I should point out, sir, that if you paint in onlyone direction, it will be $300 a gallon.\n\nCustomer: I thought your most expensive paint was $200!\n\nClerk: That's if you paint around the room to the point at whichYou started. A hallway is different.\n\nCustomer: And if I buy $200 paint for the hall, but only paintin one direction, you'll confiscate the remaining paint.\n\nClerk: No, we'll charge you an extra use fee plus the differenceon your next gallon of paint. But I believe you're getting it now, sir.\n\nCustomer: You're insane!\n\nClerk: Thanks for painting with United.",

My grandpa steers and my grandma sits in the back to tell him when he can switch lanes, back up, anything like that (because he can't turn his head). He also doesn't observe speed limit signs. He doesn't drive fast, its just whatever the speed limit is he cruises around 25mph. The road to my church has a speed limit of 40. His response while driving? \"Hm looks like we're holding up traffic a bit, Granny! can I get over?\" *merges before she answers* Needless to say, God was with us on the drive there and back.",

The priest suddenly stood up and exclaimed \"My, it is becoming a very hot day and we forgot to pack some drinks. I am going to go the store and get some soda for myself.\" So the priest jumped off the boat, walked on the water to the shore, went to the store and bought a soda. He then came back to the boat the same way and once again started to fish. The preacher after some time told the other two that he was feeling thirsty as well and will be going to the store. So the preacher stood up, jumped off the boat, walked on the water to the shore, went to the store and bought some water. Like the priest, he came back to the boat and began to fish. The rabbi saw what the other two did and sat there in disbelief. He couldn't believe that they both were able to walk on water. So he said to them, \"Hmph it is so easy to walk on water anyone can do it. I am also going to go to the store to get something to drink.\" So the rabbi jumped out of the boat and then began to flail around in the water. The priest and the preacher looked at each other. The priest then asked the preacher, \"Should we have told him about the stepping stones?\"",

What does it do?\" she asks.   \n\t\"Just watch!\" he says as he opens the cage. \"Crunch bird, chair!\" He points to a wooden chair in the corner of the store. The bird flies out of the cage and heads straight for it. Within a matter of seconds, it's reduced to a pile of sawdust.   \n\tThe woman is impressed, but asks for another demonstration.   \n\t\"Crunch bird, desk!\" the salesman says, pointing at a nearby desk.

Finally put in a corner, he accepts her offer, and she takes the bird home.  \n\tHer husband arrives home from work a while later and immediately spots the cage.  \n\t\"What the hell kinda bird is that?\" he asks.   \n\t\"It's a crunch bird!\" she says.

        "body": "In occasional fits of self-evaluation, John used to take pride in living a very boring life. That, to him back then, was a good thing -- after all, the Chinese wish interesting lives on others as a curse. A boring life meant that everything proceeded the way that he liked. No accidents, no oddities, no distractions. No fun, but that's the cost of safety and security.\n \nAs a child, John never got in a serious accident as a child (except for that time he fell off slide the wrong way, but he landed on a soft spot so that doesn't count). His adolescence was pretty temperate. He even managed not to embarrass himself scarringly in public. After that, he went to a state college, from which he graduated after four years. Then, he got a job offer from a pretty standard company where Dilbert was popular. If this went on for longer, he would have found a lovely (but not -too- lovely) lady to marry and then die surrounded by grandchildren.\n \nOne day, though, John felt like going to the desert.\n \nThe idea just struck him on a rather unspecific Friday. On the way to work, John thought to himself, \"After work, I should get an SUV so I can go off-roading.\" At work, John thought about the dunes and the winds. On the way from work, John thought about how he has never seen a real desert before. That was very frustrating, so it made buying the most desert-like SUV he could find on a whim easier.\n \nJohn woke up early the next morning. He had a light meal of cereal and strawberries for breakfast. Then he hopped on his new SUV and drove east. Just... east. The highway should take him to a desert in the east, John thought. He fiddled with the audio system a little and tried to find a radio station to listen to. But, no -- the music only distracted him from the excitement he was fermenting in right now. This was an emotion of rare intensity (considering how plaid his life has been), so logically he should savor it to the fullest.\n \nWith the sun at its zenith, John began to notice the dunes in the distance and the clear, blue sky above them. All inhibition was gone -- he pressed on the gas pedal and the SUV ran at very slightly above the speed limit. He just... had to get there, and feel his car wade through the sand and rocks. There must be so many sights in the wastes to see. He might even run across a saguaro. Ah, damn, he should have brought a camera and someone to take a picture of him next to the tallest saguaro he could find. And before John even realized it himself, he was off the road for the first time.\n \nHe had a blast. The desert was so different from the city or the beach. Everything felt pure and rarefied there, as if all the dross had been burnt away by the sun's heat. Speaking of which, the sun was blazing hot. Even with the AC at full power, John could feel the desert heat, and the tan that the sun through the window was giving. Anyways, it was probably the first time John went \"crazy\". The sensation of losing control just by a little bit overwhelmed him. The rough terrain rocked him uncomfortably, but he far preferred it to the certain comfort of the office chair. Every once in a he worried if the SUV was going to flip -- but then, it didn't. It gave him a jolt like nothing else. He has never done any hard drugs before, but it must be nothing like off-roading in the desert. Exploring virgin, untrodden sand felt like a series of small conquests. Venturing where no man has gone before, freely going wherever he wan----\n \nAnd then, a blink and a beep.\n \nOut of gas.\n \n...\n \nWith a plastic bottle in each hand, John waded through the sand trying to swallow him whole. It was so hard to maintain balance, with the ground shifting and sinking with each footstep. The scorching evening sun didn't help, either. The desert sun at noon must have been more painful, but at least it didn't get in your eye. John had been following the sun for a few hours now. At first, he tried to backtrack, but the tracks had already been erased by the desert wind. \"The desert is to the east,\" John thought, \"so I should go west.\"\n \nJohn had already drunk half the bottle of water by the time the sun set. This was pretty bad, because when he got out of the car he expected for the bottle to last at least until tomorrow late afternoon. \"It will be even hotter at noon tomorrow,\" John thought to himself again. \"I'm fucked.\"\n \nThe night cold of the desert gave such a hateful contrast to the day heat. He had heard that it's cold at night in deserts, but John didn't think it would be -this- cold. He was freezing, for God's sake. And it's so arid. John hugged himself even tighter to keep himself warm, next to the tallest saguaro he has ever seen. He thought about getting into the sand to protect himself from the cold, but then sand would get in all of his clothes and he would be annoyed to death tomorrow. He also thought about crying, but he fell unconscious before he could make the decision.\n \nThe next morning, John once again considered crying, because he must have lost the good bottle over the night. Either the wind took it or it sank into the sand somewhere. Maybe the devil took it, he doesn't know. John looked at the only bottle he has left now -- the bottle with pale blue liquid in it. He has heard that they use water and denatured ethanol in windshield washer fluids and, while it would burn, it would at least quench the thirst. It will probably taste like the worst thing ever, but that's preferable to being mummified alive.\n \nThe sun was at its zenith when John worked up the courage to try drinking the windshield washer. He kept seeing an oasis in a distance, but it kept running away -- so he concluded that he has begun hallucinating from the heat and the thirst. Might as well try this out anyway, and... Jesus Christ, it tasted like murder. The fluid stabbed at John's dry throat and burned it, like vodka distilled from hate. The pain faded away after a few seconds. Thankfully, his throat wasn't as dry anymore. John resumed to soldier forth.\n \n...\n \nWhy did he listen to the horse? He should have walked -away- from the morning sun, because the sun rises from the east. Thanks to the stupid animal, John was walking the wrong way for half a day. But most importantly -- where did this horse come from?\n \n...\n \nThe sun was setting. John had trouble understanding his own gibberish anymore. It also might have been getting dark faster than is usual for summer, because everything was so hard to see. He drank the last gulp of the windwasher fluid and tossed the bottle away (John would usually not litter). Then he collapsed onto his knees, sinking a little bit into the dune. It's so hard to walk anymore, but crawling was really easy. John fondly regarded his childhood. As the sand cooked his hands and legs, John's life began to play out in his hazy mind like a VHS tape that's been too close to a magnet. \"Life was pretty boring, wasn't it?,\" John's brain stringed together some words. \"Getting into a fight once might have been fun.\" All the things he couldn't do, all the regret came in like a tsunami and swept away all hopes for escape. He decided to cry, but he couldn't. He tried wailing, but only dry gasp came out of his throat.\n \nJohn became afraid of death, but then he felt the cold marble floor beneath him.\n \n\"You look like death,\" a voice said. John looked up, but he could only see black and red spots against a field of dark brown felt. \"You should find help before the cold kills you.\"\n \nEven in his delirium, John could tell that this must not be real. For one, the voice was too beautiful. Had angels been real, the voice must have belonged to one. But no matter, he just didn't want to die.\n \n\"I don't want to die.\"\n \n\"Is that a wish?\" the voice replied, now with a tone of definite curiosity. \"I mean, I can help you with that if you so wish. But you have to pay a price. With this contract you mus--\"\n \n\"Just help me.\"\n \n\"Okay, we have a deal,\" said the voice. And then John felt a pair of fangs spear into his throat.\n \n...\n \nThere were so many stars in the night sky. One usually thinks that night is dark, but with so many stars, the night sky was actually bright. Lying with his back against the marble floor (surprisingly comfortable, actually), John tried to trace as many constellations as he could from memory for a few minutes.\n \n\"Are you feeling better now?,\" a sort-of familiar voice was heard from outside the vision, with concern. \"I broke a few rules, but, you know, I just didn't want to deal with someone dying right in front of me.\"\n \nJohn bolted up to see what the fuck just happened right there. He surprised himself -- it was so easy. Not compared to how he was near death, but to how he usually is. Not only that, he felt wonderful.\n \nHe turned around to see a snake with red eyes. A very large snake with burning red eyes.\n \nIt took a few seconds for John to assess the situation. And then he said -- \"Thank you... for saving my life.\"\n \nThe snake slithered across the air to get close to John, its tongue feeling the air to smell how he was now. \"No need to thank me, it's all a part of work. Anyways, are you feeling better now?\" \n \n\"Yeah. Better than ever, actually.\" John tried to figure out exactly what made him feel better. Whatever happened, he now felt more... vigorous, energetic and... unburdened? As if a life-long chain has been lifted. \"What did you do?\"\n \n\"Oh, you know. Granted a wish and all that.\" John could have sworn that the snake grinned widely. \"When you came here, you were dying from methanol poisoning. So I detox'd you. You were also very thirsty, so I took care of that. But most importantly, there was a small cancer growing in your liver.\"\n \nThe snake uncoiled itself from a... stick, that emerged from at the center of a very ornately engraved circular white marble floor. As it slithered around the perimeter, the spilt sand was swept away. Apparently it was cleaning the floor. It also showed that the snake must have been at least fifteen yards in length. \"Though, to clarify: you asked for not to die, but that wish is against the rules. So... I gave it a liberal interpretation. So you will not die -for a while-. I made you very healthy, so you probably won't have trouble living to be 120 years old.\" The snake nodded its head. \"As long as you don't get yourself killed, you know. It seems like you do stuff like this often.\"\n \nJohn shook his head in denial. \"No, this is my first time. And... rules?,\" he questioned. \"Are you some kind of a genie? Or are you the Devil?\"\n \nThe snake made some kind of sound that probably equated to snakes laughing. \"Oh, it never gets old. No, I'm not a genie and I'm not the Devil. I'm just a fallen angel.\" It coiled itself against the stick and looked right into John's eyes. The fiery eyes flared like twin suns and rays of starlight descended from the sky to shine in the shape of ephemeral wings on the back. The voice, it suffocated the sound of desert silence and quaked the very space itself. \"I am Nathaniel, the seraph.\"\n \n\"I am John,\" the mortal introduced himself. \"...the office drone.\"\n \nThe fires died out, the lights turned to normal and the rolling sound of silence returned. \"So, yeah. No need to be scared or anything,\" Nathaniel seemed to grin as he spoke. \"I'm just... here doing my job. Speaking of which.\"\n \nThe angel cleared his throat before elaborating on the \"rules\": \"Ok, God sent me here to hire someone for a task. It's a very important and difficult job, so the compensation for it is pretty good. Those who accept the job are given three wishes. These wishes can be anything, as long as you really, actually and truly want it and as long as it doesn't trespass God's authority. And, no, I'm not one of those asshole spirits that twist the wishes or give them literally. God's the one doing the work, so I don't need to be stringent or anything. Your first wish has been fulfilled. You have two wishes left. Be very careful and deliberate for those two, because they have to compensate for the duty you've been given.\"\n \n\"What's my duty?\" John asked, dumbstruck and unable to believe.\n \nNathaniel looked away a little, as if he felt uncomfortable breaking the news. \"Well, ok. John. I'll put this very simply this time. Your duty is to end the world.\"\n \nAwkward silence followed. Nathaniel seemed to brace for an inevitable tirade. John, to the contrary, was at complete loss for words. The mortal occasionally opened his mouth to say something, perhaps in protest or in confusion, but then he closed it again. He would try again when he felt he had processed the situation sufficiently, but no -- he was wrong. At least for a few minutes.\n \nAnd, eventually. \"So... My job is to end the world.\"\n \n\"Yes.\"\n \n\"Why? And how? And when?\"\n \n\"Well, ok. It's kinda convoluted. And you are handling this very maturely right now, by the way.\" Nathaniel coughed softly before continuing. \"As for why... Hm. Imagine that you are making a perpetual motion machine. Once you get it going, it keeps going. Maybe it goes faster and faster if you are good enough at making machines, I don't know. Anyways, when it goes too fast, it's dangerous to stop it from outside. It would hurt if your finger got jammed between the gears, right? So... God made a self-termination switch.\" Nathaniel unwound himself from the stick. \"This right here is the switch. God put it here so someone can stop the world from the inside if it becomes necessary.\n \n\"And now, as for how... It's simple. You -- and only you -- can move this staff. If you push it, pull it, or in any other way disturb it, everything dies. Nothing gets left behind. Nada. Nil. Zilch. Once you do it, it's done.\" Nathaniel gestured his tail across his throat. \"It's really easy, but it's total and it's irreversible. That's why it's so hard.\"\n \nJohn listened attentively, though he took it only three-quarters-seriously. After all, a talking snake?\n \n\"Hm. Ok, last question. When... is up to you.\" Had Nathaniel been human, a look of doubt and fear would have come across his face. Sadly, he was still a snake. \"It's your job to determine when the world will end. Now that you have been chosen, I can't stop you from deciding when. Even if you try to pull the plug on the world because you got dumped by your girl... well, they say 'significant other' now, don't they? Well, by your significant other, I'm not allowed to stop you in any way or spirit. But I can ask you to be very deliberate. Please, please be very deliberate.\" The snake gazed at the human intently. \"There is so much to this world that I haven't seen yet and I would like to learn more about it before it ends.\"\n \nNathaniel stopped to speak for a short while. Assuming that he has finished explaining, John brought his right hand to his chin to help him consider the situation. It all was very confusing. Before this day, John didn't believe in God. And, if anything, he wasn't believing in God more at this point. Why would God do this sort of thing? It's all very absurd.\n \nBut, from the deep of his soul, John could feel that he was given a very, very serious duty.\n \n\"Why was I chosen?\"\n \n\"You... uh... found me.\" Nathaniel shifted his focus away from John, as if he was taken by a sense of inadequacy. \"Long before I had criteria for selecting people for this job, but they were all lousy at it. After a while, I decided to not have any at all.\" The snake sighed. \"I think it's been working out greatly. Somehow random people are more emotionally stable than prophesied legendary heroes.\"\n \n\"What if I don't want to do it?\"\n \n\"It's too late.\"\n \n\"Can I wish not to have to do this?\"\n \nNathaniel sighed. \"No, that's infringing on God's authority, so it's against the rules. You -have- to do it, John. And I'm pretty sure you will be good at it.\"\n \n\"How do you know that?\" John accused the angel of empty words of comfort.\n \n\"I have been talking to you for a good while now, haven't I?\" The snake's facial muscles did their best to smile. \"After a few billion years, you learn how to read people.\"\n \nIt seemed that John wanted to argue with that, but only silence followed for a moment.\n \n\"This is a stupid job.\"\n \n\"It pays well.\"\n \n...\n \nOn the circle, the night air felt cool rather than cold. Waiting for dawn's light, John watched the stars trace the globe of the sky once he ran out of things to ask Nathaniel about. Well, he was curious if he was actually an angel and, if he was, what it is like to be an angel.\n \nBut that all felt improper.\n \nJohn found the morning star when the skirt of the sky began to grow yellow, pink and red. In minutes, it would be bright again. He would have to find a way to get back home from here. Perhaps continuing going west is the best course of action--\n \n\"If you walk south from here for about three hours, you will find a highway. Go eastbound and there will be a small town. If you tell them that you got lost while off-roading, they will help you out,\" Nathaniel interrupted John's train of thought. \"And you must be hungry, right? Here, have something to eat before you head out.\"\n \nA plate consisting of a loaf of bread, a chunk of cheese and a mug of wine sat on the marble floor.\n \n\"Thanks, but where did you get this?\"\n \n\"Heaven.\"\n \n...\n \nJohn dusted his pants one more time. As he stepped outside the border of the marble circle, he could feel the sun grow a thousand times more fierce.\n \n\"Uh, hey, Nate,\" John said hesitantly. \"Do you mind if I come back later for the other two wishes? I can't think of anything good right now.\"\n \n\"Call me Nathaniel. And it's ok, that's what most people do when they don't feel like asking for money.\"\n \n\"People seriously ask for money?\" John asked in surprise at the banality.\n \n\"Well, I know what you mean. I think it's odd when people ask for money over... true love, or peace, or anything like that. I asked a few why.\"\n \n\"What did they say?\"\n \n\"'You are too young to understand'. Which is kind of funny, because, you know, billions of years old,\" the snake seemed to smirk. \"But they probably meant that I'm not close enough to death to understand.\"\n \nJohn seemed clearly unsatisfied at the answer or the extrapolation. \"I still don't get it. It'd be nice to understand what they meant. Perhaps I'll ask for that when I come back later. To understand what other people are saying.\"\n \nNathaniel's tongue licked the air a few times. \"That would be interesting. I don't think anyone has asked for that before. Do you want that wish granted now?\"\n \nJohn hesitated for a moment.\n \n\"Nah. I need a reason to come back here for.\"\n \nWith that, John smiled brightly at Nathaniel, and walked south.\n \n...\n \nAfter that weekend, John's life seemed to return to normal. The snake stopped appearing in his dreams after a week or so and he eventually forgot that he doesn't need health check-ups anymore in three months' time. It was boring again. Very stable, but boring.\n \nA year since meeting Nathaniel, John got mugged.\n \n\"Give me all you got, bitch, or I'll blow up your head,\" the barrel of the gun said.\n \nJohn reached for his back pocket and produced an old, light brown wallet. Calmly, he handed it to the mugger, wondering: \"Why do you want this?\"\n \nThe barrel dropped. The dumbfounded face behind it asked if John was fucking serious.\n \nAfter that encounter, John remembered that wish he wanted granted.\n \n...\n \nThis time, John drew a map. He learned from the Internet how to prepare for desert exploration. Over a period of a month, he gathered the tools and gears needed to save him the pain. Learning how to locate himself using the stars would have been useful, but that's too much work; he'll just bet on his luck on that. With a rental SUV, he drove his way to the small village to the southeast and, from there, carefully trekked up north with a pair of binoculars. He started his search in the morning and found Nathaniel by mid-afternoon.\n \n\"What's up?\" the angel asked.\n \n\"I got mugged,\" John answered.\n \n\"Ah, damn. Did you get hurt?\" A tone of worry and concern colored Nathaniel's voice.\n \n\"No, but it helped me remember something.\" John spoke very evenly. Perhaps he wanted to come off unconcerned?\n \n\"Nearly dying once?\"\n \n\"Huh.\" John amusedly reviewed the situation, now and back then. \"Maybe. I should hire a psychoanalyst.\"\n \n\"Freudians are a bunch of quacks. And they are very expensive,\" dismissed Nathaniel.\n \nJohn replied with a smile. \"It's fun, though.\"\n \nThe conversation broke for about ten seconds; a period during which desert gust blew across the landscape.\n \n\"Hey, Nate.\"\n \n\"Call me Nathaniel. And time to pull the plug?\" The angel put on a very as-a-matter-of-factly attitude.\n \n\"Um.\" John put his right hand on his chin to help him consider the proposition, but: \"No, not today.\"\n \nNathaniel breathed a sigh of relief.\n \n\"I actually came back for my second wish.\"\n \n\"I would have preferred if you came for friendship.\"\n \nIt broke for another time; during this period, a desert creature cried out in the far back.\n \n\"You think of me as a friend?\" John asked with honest awe.\n \n\"Anybody's your friend when your neighbors are rocks and cacti.\" The snake clicked his tongue. \"I don't have that many people to talk to, being bound here and all.\"\n \n\"Really? You can't leave?\"\n \n\"Well.\" Nathaniel hesitated. \"I can leave... I think. Well, probably not. Anyways, if I do I might not see you come here and pull the lever. Then I won't be able to plug my ears.\"\n \n\"I thought everyone just... died. Nothing loud.\"\n \n\"Well, everyone just dies, yeah. In very big explosions.\"\n \n\"You can't plug your ears. You don't have arms.\"\n \n\"I can try.\"\n \nThe sound of sands rolling down the dunes punctuated the conversation.\n \n\"I want you to grant me my second wish.\" John demanded.\n \nExcited to find out what John has in mind, Nathaniel eagerly questioned. \"Oh? What will it be this time?\"\n \n\"I want to be able to understand people.\"\n \nThe snake paused for a second, perhaps to discern whether it would be a good wish for John or not. In the end, he said: \"That is a very difficult wish to live with, you know that?\"\n \n\"I figured so.\"\n \n\"Well, no regrets.\"\n \nNathaniel bit John.\n \n...\n \nWhen John woke up, the sun was setting. Stars could be faintly seen through the still-pale blue sky, and a pregnant moon was floating about as well. A shooting star burnt through the atmosphere, leaving a short trail, far away from John's focus when a curious voice was heard.\n \n\"Are you feeling better now?\"\n \n\"Um. Yeah.\" John reoriented himself. \"Thanks, Nate.\"\n \n\"Call me Nathaniel.\"\n \n\"Now that I think about it, do I annoy you when I call you Nate?\" John asked the angel, with sincerity.\n \n\"Well,\" Nathaniel considered the question. \"A little?\"\n \n\"But that's how a friend would call you. Nathaniel is a mouthful.\"\n \n\"Agreed on that. But, you know.\" The angel paused for a second.\n \n\"What is it?\"\n \nNathaniel slowly uncoiled himself from the switch and slithered toward the perimeter, dutifully. \"God gave me this name.\"\n \nThe sound of Nathaniel's scales against the marble floor and the sand grains on it filled the air.\n \n\"I think I can understand that.\" John admitted. \"I still don't believe in God, but I think I can understand that.\"\n \nThe snake giggled. \"Is that because you learned how to understand me?\"\n \n\"No. Actually, no, I don't think so.\" John gripped his chin. \"At least, this isn't what I asked for.\"\n \nNathaniel laughed.\n \n...\n \nJohn didn't bother sitting up that night. He just laid comfortably on his back and watched the stars, while chatting with Nathaniel about, in sum, everything about the world.\n \n\"Hey, you said you can't leave the circle, right? But you seem pretty up to date,\" John asked.\n \n\"Doves,\" answered Nathaniel. \"They drop by every once in a while.\"\n \nJohn finally asked the angel about whether he was really an angel or not. The answer was very elaborate -- Nathaniel was apparently very proud of the time before he fell. He explained what it is like to be in Heaven and in presence of God. It all sounded like some fantasy novel to John, but even then, it was the most interesting fantasy novel. Perhaps because it was being told in person, and by a very excited character?\n \n\"Hey, Nathaniel, I hope you don't mind me asking, but...\" John considered the true worth of bringing this up. \"Why did you fall\"?\n \n\"Um. How do I put this?\" Nathaniel pondered for a second or so. \"I wanted to explore the world that God made more closely.\"\n \n\"That's it?\"\n \n\"I accidentally ended the dinosaurs.\"\n \n\"Oh.\"\n \nNathaniel asked if John liked to travel. John didn't, so he said no. When it was apparent that Nathaniel was disappointed (perhaps he wanted to hear travel stories), John explained that he wasn't a very adventurous person. He has never done anything out of ordinary in his life and he has grown too comfortable with it. Travelling explicitly means leaving one's comfort zone. John could never do that.\n \n\"But you came here,\" wondered Nathaniel.\n \n\"You are right.\"\n \n\"Maybe this could be a first step.\"\n \n\"I'll think about it.\"\n \nAnd then it was morning.\n \n...\n \nJohn promised to return soon when he left Nathaniel this time. He meant it -- after all, this might be a good way to break out of his routine. Furthermore, Nathaniel so badly wants to travel and explore but can't. To linger in the comfort zone forever would be an insult to a good friend.\n \nAnd so John quit his office job and began to travel around the world, for a few years.\n \nFirst, he went to India. Then Tibet, followed by Maghreb. He went to Europe, but did not go to Britain. Hungary was very enjoyable, even though he ran out of money there. John washed dishes and kicked people out of clubs for a few months -- he met many interesting people doing so. Once he's gathered enough money, he hopped on a boat back to America. Over the Atlantic, John finished his plans on walking across and around North America.\n \n...\n \n\"I brought you books.\"\n \n\"I thought you died.\"\n \n\"Can you read?\"\n \n\"You lied when you'd return soon.\"\n \n\"Well.\"\n \n...\n \nBack in his apartment, John tried to figure out his next course of action. He learned a lot in the last five years from all that travel and all that talk, he thought. Perhaps writing about the lessons might be a good idea.\n \n...\n \n\"I brought you books.\"\n \n\"Ooh! Did you bring yours, too?\"\n \n\"What? Why would you need self-help books?\"\n \n\"I have a lot of time to improve myself.\"\n \n\"You've been like that for a few billion years.\"\n \n\"Well.\"\n \n...\n \nSixty years since meeting Nathaniel, John got mugged.\n \n\"Give me all you got, bitch, or I'll blow up your head,\" the barrel of the gun said.\n \nJohn reached for his back pocket and produced an old, light brown notepad. Calmly, he handed it to the mugger, saying: \"All I have is names and directions.\"\n \nThe barrel dropped. The dumbfounded face behind it asked if John was fucking serious.\n \nJohn remembered the last wish.\n \n...\n \nWhen John climbed the last dune to the marble circle, he noticed that Nathaniel brought someone for their monthly meeting. It was quite out of the ordinary, but no matter -- if a good friend wants to introduce him to them, then it must be good.\n \n\"What's up?\" The angel asked.\n \n\"I got mugged,\" John answered.\n \n\"Again?\"\n \nJohn shrugged, as if at a loss for a proper response. \"Well, this is the second time. At least that I remember.\"\n \n\"Hm,\" Nathaniel reconsidered. \"It feels like yesterday for me.\"\n \n\"So...\" John eyed the new guest.\n \n\"Ah, yes.\" The big snake encircled the little snake and tightened in, probably affectionately. \"This is my daughter, John. I want you to meet her.\"\n \nThe words brought a smile to John's face. He leaned down to be closer to the child. \"Hi. What's your name?\"\n \n\"Call me Sarai.\"\n \n\"My name is John.\" Saying his, he offered his hand. \"It's very nice to meet you.\"\n \nThe girl extended her tail and gripped onto the index finger. Will do for a handshake.\n \n\"Now that I've met such an adorable young girl,\" John mused, \"I can't pull the lever in front of her anymore.\"\n \n\"Speaking of which...\"\n \nThe unusual heaviness of Nathaniel's voice made John uncomfortable, and maybe a little queasy.\n \n\"Before that happens, old friend. Could you grant me a wish this time?\"\n \n...\n \nFirst, they were going to ride across Canada and America. After that they will head down south, driving around South America by the Pacific and the Atlantic. It would be very nice if they could head to the Amazon, too, but it was doubtful that it had accommodations for an RV.\n \nSarai sat on John's right shoulder as they traveled. She would be so excited to see anything that isn't made of sand and rocks. It reminded John of himself back long ago, when he first came to the desert. It was so different. It might have been meaningless to someone who has always been there, but to outsiders, it's exotic and special. Perhaps this is why Nathaniel is so curious about the world -- he is an outsider to all but the tiny little circle in the desert. Everything is exotic and special to him.\n \nThe best he could do for him was to show the world to his child. When they have seen every thing there is to see in this world, Sarai will go home and tell her father all about it. Nathaniel might not be able to leave until the day he dies, but at least he would have explored the world vicariously. Little satisfactions.\n \n...\n \n\"Hey, John, what should we tell him first about?\" Sarai asked John, on their way to the desert.\n \n\"I don't know, Sarai. What was the most fun for you?\"\n \n\"Mmm.\" The girl pondered. \"I liked the mountains. They were like the dunes, except really big and really tall.\"\n \n\"Which mountains? We saw many of them, didn't we?\"\n \n\"Ehhh. I can't remember them all.\"\n \nIt's been six months since Nathaniel asked John to show Sarai the world. Before leaving for Africa, she wanted to see her father again. John agreed -- it might be years they might be spending there, this time. Furthermore, he couldn't wait for his third wish.\n \nThe road and the desert seemed different this time. Almost... like the first time. Sense of excitement and wonder. Was it because they couldn't wait to share their experience with Nathaniel? In any case, they had to see him as quickly as possible.\n \nThe RV crawled up the dunes rather slowly. It seemed to do so well everywhere else... But this was the last time they will be riding this thing. On the other hand, it was somewhat nostalgic for John. The imbalance on the sand. The uncomfortable rocking. The loss of control.\n \nThe loss of control.\n \n\"DADDY!!!\" The moment she spotted him down the dune, Sarai screamed from John's shoulder. He must have pressed either the brake or the gas pedal too hard. The wheels spun out of control in the sand. The weight of the RV slowly dragged it down the slope, gradually but surely accelerating as it goes. John tried to regain control, but it seemed too late.\n \nAnd it was heading right onto the circle.\n \nNathaniel had already uncoiled himself from the lever, to see what's going on with the RV sliding down the dune. And then he realized -- it is John who is driving that thing... and it is in crash course with the switch that will end the world.\n \nJohn noticed the very large snake bunch up between the falling vehicle and the switch. At the rate it's going, the RV will hit Nathaniel and flip. That surely would kill Nathaniel, but the alternative is the lever behind him. But can John live with himself after killing his oldest friend like this? If he can't live with that, then maybe it's better to swerve, so the lever instead of Nathaniel will be hit. Either way, John's world will have come to end.\n \nAnd to think that John's last wish was for Nathaniel to be free from his duty so he can explore the world with them.\n \nA mere second before impact.\n \nJohn had to choose.\n \n \n \n\"BETTER NATE THAN LEVER.\"",

Now at this point I'm a little angry, so I seacht the entire apartment and I can't find anyone. Until I look onto the valcony and I see 2 hands holding on the railing. Now I am really pissed off, I try to pry them off, I try to kick them off but he just won't let go, so finally I get a hammer an I smack his fingers till he let's go. He falls down all 33 floors but a tree and a bush break his fall and I can see he's still alive. this makes me so angry I grab the fridge and throw it off the balcony but because of the strain i get a heart attack and I die.\"\n\"well you can go  in\" says saint Peter.\nThe second man steps up to the metaphorical plate.\n\"well I was training on my treadmill on the 34th floor where I live, when it breaks down and shoots me out of the window. Luckily I managed to catch onto the balcony of the 33rd floor. Then this absolute mad man goes beserk and treis to pry my hands off, kick them off, and finally het gets his hamer and I'm forced to let go. Now I fall all the way down, but again lady luck smiles on me and I land in some bushes and survive. Until this absolute dickhead throws a fridge off his balcony onto me and I end up dieing anyways.\"\nSaint Peter let's him in too.\nThe third man then steps forward and says to saint Peter: \"You'll never believe it, but I was hiding naked in a fridge...\"",

He knocks on the door, and a man clad in dirty overalls answers. The man explains his situation, and asks if it would be possible to stay the night with the farmer until he could get his car fixed in the morning. The farmer explains that the town has but one auto shop, which will not be open again until Monday. He offers to let the stranger spend the weekend, under one condition: \" You are welcome to spend the weekend here. All I ask is that you keep your hands off my two daughters, Nelly and Venus\". The stranger agrees. The next night, Nelly comes to her father and asks permission to go on a date with the stranger. \"I suppose it will be okay\", the farmer says. \"You can use my truck, but no funny business\". That night, the man and Nelly load up in the farmers old beat up truck, drive a few miles down the road to a secluded spot, where he proceeds to bang her brains out. When they finished, they returned to the farm house and went to bed as if nothing had happened. The following night, Venus approaches her father with the same request, and the farmer gives her the same answer. \"I suppose its okay. You can use my truck, but no funny business\". That night, Venus and the stranger take off to the same secluded spot where he had taken Nelly the night before, where he proceeded to bang her brains out. Monday morning comes. The man gets his car fixed and returns to his home in the city. Once he arrives home, he decides to send the farmer some money to show his appreciation, so he writes a check and mails it to him. A couple of months go by, and the man receives an unexpected letter from the farmers address. Inside the envelope he finds a poem, which read as follows: \"Are you the one that done the pushin', and left those stains upon my cushion, and your footprints on my dashboard upside down? Cause since you dated my daughter Nelly, she's had some swelling in her belly. I think you'd better come on back to town\". The man was stunned, and unsure of what to do or how to respond. After some thought on the matter, he decides to try his own hand at poetry, so he mails the farmer the following poem: \"Yes I'm the one that did the pushin', and left the stains upon your cushion, and my footprints on your dashboard upside down. But since I dated your daughter Venus, I've had some burning in my penis, so I guess we're 50/50 all around.",

On the table was a big bowl of peanuts. He thought to himself that one or two wouldn't hurt and he was getting pretty hungry. A few peanuts led to many and next thing you know Father Chris had eaten the whole bowl. Mrs Stuart was on her way back out with a tray of sandwiches and pot of Fathers favourite tea. \"I'm sorry I took so long dear, you must be really hungry\" said Mrs Stuart. \"it's okay Mrs Stuart, I must apologize myself, I had a few of your delicious peanuts and ended up eating the whole bowl\" said father Chris. Mrs Stuart replied \"oh don't worry about those dear, I just like to suck off all of the chocolate\" :)",

The piranhas were all like \"hey it's not a fair tournament! The cephalopods always got the advantage! We got good teeth but you can squirt ink and kick us with ya tentacles and stuff!\"\n\nAnd the squids are like \"no, no, no, it's totally fair. Piranhas got more agility and their teeth are just plain deadly, man\". The squids are real defensive of their MMA tourney.\n\nAnd this nun (who walked into the bar before, remember-bet you didn't remember) speaks up and is like \"hey, why all the fighting? Why do you need an MMA tournament in the first place?\"\n\nBut then the nun's robe and veil suddenly start talking out of nowhere. Nun's Habits have been known to come alive before, but are usually held back from doing this by a restrictive Papal proclamation put forth by Pope Francis last November-the Holy Habit Constrainment Order, PO #7462.5.\n\n\nBut this nun's robes come alive and stuff and they start taking to these squids and piranhas.\n\nAnd suddenly things are starting to make sense and the nun's Habit is laying down some awesome new ground rules for the squids' and piranhas' mutual MMA tournaments. Things are looking good.\n\nBut then the robes and veil combo, amidst the nun standing around looking bored while her clothes did all the talking, made a suggestion to split up some of the allowed MMA moves per species. It said \"you know what, why don't we limit hand moves like punching and grabbing to the squids, and we'll let the piranhas take all the footwork and agility stuff, like kicks.\"\n\nA deathly silence suddenly fell over the room. The Habit said \"what? Did I say something wrong?\" The worried look on its face was reflected by glares from the squids and piranhas alike.\n\nThe Alpha Squid stood up on his two strongest legs and walked to the door of the bar. The other squids followed him to the door. The piranhas turned their faces away in fear. At this point the Habit is so confused as to what it said to offend these squids, just being a gentle robe and headpiece and all.\n\nBut just as the squids got to the exit, they all turned around, and threw their sunglasses on Squirtle Squad style. The Alpha Squid said, calmly but firmly:\n\n\n\n\"Silly Habit, kicks are for squids.\"\n\nAnd they all left the bar and never came back.",

They got peaches any flavor you want!\".\n\nThe older boy says \"Nah, they don't. They're just trying to get your attention.\"\n\nThe younger boy says \"Aw, come on! Let's go get one!\"\n\nThe older boy just utters \"Fine...\" and quickly does a U-turn back towards the orchard. He parks the truck next to the sign and says \"Alright, get your peach and I'll wait here.\"\n\nThe younger boy jumps out of the truck and runs towards an old house off in the distance. When he gets there, he sees an old man sitting on a rocking chair on the front porch.\n\nThe younger boy says \"Hey, that sign said 'Peaches any flavor you want'. Is it true?\".\n\nThe old man replies with \"Sure is. I got peaches any flavor you want.\" \n\nThe younger boy says \"Got any flavored like peanut butter and jelly?\"\n\nThe old man points at a tree, and says \"Sure do. It's that tree just over yonder.\"\n\nThe younger boy walks over to the tree and picks a peach. He takes a bite, and sure enough, it tastes just like peanut butter. But there's no hint of jelly.\n\n\"I can taste the peanut butter, but where's the jelly?\" said the younger boy.\n\n\"You just turn that peach on over, son.\" says the old man\n\nThe younger boy flips the peach over and takes a bite.  The peach tastes just like grape jelly. Excited over this, he runs back to the truck.\n \n\"It's true! They got peaches any flavor you want!\" said the younger boy.\n\"Alright, I gotta see this...\" said the older brother as he gets out of the truck.\n\nThe older brother makes his way up to the old man's house.\n\n\"Alright, he says you got peaches any flavor you want. Is it true?\" said the older boy\n\n\"Sure is, sonny. I got all kinds of flavors.\" said the old man\n\nThe older boy gets a smug look, and replied \"OK... You got one that tastes like pussy?\"\n\nWith a sly grin, the old man points to a tree and says \"Sure do. It's that tree just over there.\"\n\nThe older boy walks to the tree and picks a peach. He hesitates, but then takes a big bite. He's disgusted by the taste.\n\n\"Ugh, this tastes like shit!\" says the older boy\n\nFrom the distance, he hears the old man yell \"WELL, TURN IT OVER!\"\n\n\n\n\nEdit: A few spelling corrections.\n",

        "body": "**The impact of Transphobia in the electrician community and how it is related to their incredibly high suicide rate.**\n\n\nTransphobia is ethimologically the term of having an irrational fear of transgender people, but is widly used to caracterise all discrimination of transgender people. To understand it, we need to first understand who are trans people.\n\n\n**First part : Who are transgender people.**\n\n\nTo understand that transgender have the same right and be treated as equals, it is first important to understand who they are and not just limit oneself to the clich\u00e9s that are propaged by our popular culture : Transgender actually cover many situation related to one's gender identity or gender expression. While people self-identify as transgender, the transgender identity umbrella includes sometimes-overlapping categories. \n\n\nTranssexual people identify as a member of the sex opposite to that assigned at birth, and desire to live and be accepted as such\nTranssexual people may undergo gender transition, the process of aligning one's gender expression or presentation with their internal gender identity. People who have transitioned may or may not necessarily identify as transgender or transsexual any longer, but simply as a man or a woman. Those who continue identifying as transsexual men or women may not want to ignore their pre-transition life, and may continue strong ties with other trans people and raising social consciousness.\nThe process of transition may involve some kind of medical gender reassignment therapy and often (but not always) includes hormone replacement therapy or sex reassignment surgery. References to \"pre-operative\", \"post-operative\" and \"non-operative\" transsexual people indicate whether they have had, or are planning to have sex reassignment surgery, although some trans people reject these terms as objectifying trans people based on their surgical status and not their mental gender identity.\n\n\n*Transvestite or cross-dresser*\n\n\nA transvestite is a person who cross-dresses, or dresses in clothes of the opposite sex The term \"transvestite\" is used as a synonym for the term \"cross-dresser\", although \"cross-dresser\" is generally considered the preferred term. The term 'cross-dresser' is not exactly defined in the relevant literature. Michael A. Gilbert, professor at the Department of Philosophy, York University, Toronto, offers this definition: \"[A cross-dresser] is a person who has an apparent gender identification with one sex, and who has and certainly has been birth-designated as belonging to [that] sex, but who wears the clothing of the opposite sex because it is that of the opposite sex.\" This definition excludes people \"who wear opposite sex clothing for other reasons,\" such as \"those female impersonators who look upon dressing as solely connected to their livelihood, actors undertaking roles, individual males and females enjoying a masquerade, and so on. These individuals are cross dressing but are not cross dressers.\" Cross-dressers may not identify with, or want to be the opposite gender, nor adopt the behaviors or practices of the opposite gender, and generally do not want to change their bodies medically. The majority of cross-dressers identify as heterosexual People who cross-dress in public can have a desire to pass as the opposite gender, so as not to be detected as a cross-dresser, or may be indifferent.\nThe term \"transvestite\" and the associated outdated term \"transvestism\" are conceptually different from the term \"transvestic fetishism\", as \"transvestic fetishist\" describes those who intermittently use clothing of the opposite gender for fetishistic purposes. In medical terms, transvestic fetishism is differentiated from cross-dressing by use of the separate codes\n\n\n*Genderqueer*\n\n\nGenderqueer is a recent attempt to signify gender experiences that do not fit into binary concepts, and refers to a combination of gender identities and sexual orientations. One example could be a person whose gender presentation is sometimes perceived as male, sometimes female, but whose gender identity is female, gender expression is butch, and sexual orientation is lesbian. It suggests nonconformity or mixing of gender stereotypes, conjoining both gender and sexuality,[55] and challenges existing constructions and identities.[56] In the binary sex/gender system, genderqueerness is unintelligible and abjected.\n\n\n*Androgyne*\n\n\nAn androgyne is a person who cannot be classified into the typical gender roles of their society; androgyny is independent of orientation. Androgynes may identify as beyond gender, between genders, moving across genders, entirely genderless, or any or all of these, exhibiting a variety of male, female, and other characteristics. Androgyne identities include pangender, ambigender, non-gendered, agender, gender fluid or intergender. Androgyny can be either physical or psychological and is independent of birth sex. Occasionally, non-androgynous people adapt their physical appearance to look androgynous. This outward androgyny has been used in fashion, and the milder forms of it (women wearing men's pants or men wearing two earrings, for example) are not seen as transgender behavior.\nThe term androgyne is also sometimes used as a medical synonym for an intersex individual.\n\n\n*Bigender*\n\n\nA bigender (sometimes rendered as bi-gender, dual gender, or bi+gender) individual is one who moves between masculine and feminine gender roles. Such individuals fluidly move between two distinct personalities depending on context: whereas androgynous people retain the same gender-typed behaviour across situations, bigendered people consciously or unconsciously change their gender-role behaviour from primarily masculine to primarily feminine or vice versa.\nDrag kings and queens\nDrag is a term applied to clothing and make-up worn on special occasions for performing or entertaining, unlike those who are transgender or who cross-dress for other reasons. Drag performance includes overall presentation and behavior in addition to clothing and makeup. Drag can be theatrical, comedic, or grotesque. Drag queens have been considered caricatures of women by second-wave feminism. Drag artists have a long tradition in LGBT culture. Generally the terms drag queen covers men doing female drag, drag king covers women doing male drag, and faux queen covers women doing female drag. Nevertheless, there are drag artists of all genders and sexualities who perform for various reasons. Some drag performers, transvestites, and people in the gay community, have embraced the pornographically-derived term tranny to describe drag queens or people who engage in transvestism or cross-dressing, however this term is widely considered offensive if applied to transsexual people.\n\n\n**Second part  : Why the hate.**\n\n\nThe mechanisms of Transphobia are still debated :\n\nThe transfeminist theorist and author Julia Serano argues in her book Whipping Girl that transphobia is rooted in sexism. She locates the origins of both transphobia and homophobia in what she calls \"oppositional sexism\", the belief that male and female are \"rigid, mutually exclusive categories, each possessing a unique and nonoverlapping set of attributes, aptitudes, abilities, and desires\". Serano contrasts oppositional sexism with \"traditional sexism\", the belief that males and masculinity are superior to females and femininity. Furthermore, she writes that transphobia is fueled by insecurities people have about gender and gender norms.\n\n\n\nThe transgender author and critic Jody Norton believes that transphobia is an extension of homophobia and misogyny. She argues that transgender people, like gays and lesbians, are hated and feared for challenging and undermining gender norms and the gender binary. Norton writes that the \"male-to-female transgender incites transphobia through her implicit challenge to the binary division of gender upon which male cultural and political hegemony depends\"\n\n\nFor my part, i think it is the same phenomen that all form of discrimination and that people just fear and hate what they resent as not being identical to what they were accustomed to. But whatever is the phenomen, the consequences are what really matter.\n\n\n**The result : Discrimination**\n\nDiscrimination, including physical or sexual violence against trans people due to transphobia or homophobia, is a common occurrence for trans people. Every 3 days a murder of a trans person is reported, and many murders are believed to go unreported. Hate crimes against trans people are common even recently, and \"in some instances, inaction by police or other government officials leads to the untimely deaths of transgender victims.\n\nOne of the most famous incidents was the December 1993 rape and murder of Brandon Teena, a young trans man who was raped and murdered by two male friends after they found out that he had been assigned female at birth. The events became internationally known when told in the feature film Boys Don't Cry, which earned Hilary Swank an Academy Award for best actress.\n\nThe fact is that people with unclear gender identity ressent exclusion and discrimination which can affect their well being and social condition, which is why i am writting this essay (or more precisely, pasting it from wikipedia), which you should understand by now is the actual joke related to the late planetside ban affair in which the banned had to write an essay to be unbanned, and you actually didnt have to read all this to catch.",

He looked from side to side as he approached the pump, spitting chew out onto the ground as he wiped his trucker cap across the shoulder of a ratty t-shirt. He looked back at me once with a big evil grin, showing yellow teeth and a scar on his upper lip. \n\nHe looked back at the pump and started to mutter some nonsense in hillbilly-NASCAR speak; apparently he did not find the price of gasoline agreeable. Cursing to himself, the young man began to fill up his tank with gas. All the while, this man continued to speak to himself under his breath - it was at this point that I transitioned from curious to worried, as even the normal words this man was using made little sense when put together. Needless to say, I had gotten the slowest pump and was going nowhere until it finished glugging the gas into my car.\n\nThe young redneck was more fortunate than I or just cheaper, and reached to pull out the gas handle - unfortunately, he failed to release the trigger on the handle, and gasoline came spilling out all over the side of his truck and the redneck himself. \n\nThe cussing began in earnest at this point. He yelled a loud \"FUCK THIS HERE KAMA-SUTRA BULLSHIT\", which I still don't know the meaning of, save that this man was angry. The redneck marched away from the pump and into the convenience store, where he appeared to belligerently berate the poor Pakistani attendant. This went on for some time, and I had finally finished pumping my gas when the redneck returned in vitriolic fashion to his truck, swearing again under his breath; this time about some Ay-Rab Jew mongrel and something about hooker tits. \n\nFeeling that the best of the show was over, I finally got in my car to leave. Just as I buckled up, I noticed that the redneck had lit a cigarette next to his truck. I quickly fumbled for my keys - I was not going to be brought to the gates of hell alongside this moron, and sure enough the young man flicked his cigarette on the ground.\n\nThe flame lashed up his gas-stained jeans and shirt as soon as the ember touched the soiled concrete. He had not spilled much on his clothes; the majority of the gas had apparently spilled onto his arm and hand. The man raised his arm in terror, shrieking as it was fully engulfed in flame. I was frozen in shock, and before I could recover from my cowardice a police officer raced passed my car and dragged the man away from the gas pumps. He quickly made the man roll on the ground and the fire was out before it could spread to the man's face, or worse, the rest of us in the gas station parking lot.\n\nThe officer walked over to me and several other witnesses, and he asked us to stick around to give a testimony over what happened. I did so, and told him just what I've said here - minus the mongrel and hooker tits stuff. \n\nThe officer released us and I was just about to go when I saw that he was writing the redneck a ticket. I have to admit - I was curious. I politely walked back up to the officer and asked, \"Excuse me sir, it's none of my business, but I couldn't help but notice that you were writing this man a ticket. Given that he just went through a such a terrifying experience, do you mind me asking what he did to deserve a ticket?\"\n\nThe officer apparently didn't mind me asking at all. \"I don't like to do it son, but the law is the law. You can't just go around anywhere waving a firearm.\"\n\n\n\n",

The young man politely asked the rabbi if he wanted some more hot soup. The rabbi nodded his head and tok another plate of hot soup. He turned to the dog and asked him if he wanted a little taste. The dog nodded his head and took a big gulp of the soup. The rabbi started eating what was left and said to the young man \"So... young one. What is your profession?\". The young man pushed back his chair, stood up and replied \"I am a mason and damn proud of it!\". The rabbi gave a condescending shrug and went back to finishing his soup. Just as the soup was finished a young, pretty woman came in the door. She looked a bit pale and the rabbi asked her \"Good day young lady. What seems to be the problem?\". The young lady stumbled somewhat and whispered \"Oh, I'm so sorry. I was not expecting a rabbi and a dog in here\". To which the rabbi quickly replied \"Oh, do not be afraid. I'm just a humble rabbi. I mean you no harm, As for the dog, you would have to ask him yourself.\". The dog sat up and gave the girl his attention. \"Hello, dog. What are you here then?\" the woman asked. The rabbi started laughing \"Hehehe, young lady. This is a dog. He cannot speak! Tell me. What is your profession?\". The young lady pulled out a chair, firmly sat down and loudly proclaimed \"Me?! I'm a hooker!\". The man, the dog and the rabbi. all jumped in their seats with shock. To avoid the awkward silence, the man quickly asked \"soo... how much do you make doing... that?\", realising he just made the situation much worse. He quickly followed up by offering her some hot soup to which she kindly agreed. Midday turned into evening and soon everyone got along. The young man had been wondering about this for some time now, so he decided to ask the rabbi \"So, mr rabbi, sir. Have you always been a rabbi. What was your profession before becoming a rabbi?\". The rabbi jumped on his chair, pulled his pockets inside out and started spinning like a dreidel while shouting \"Eeeeey! I used to be a banker but...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n-wait for it-\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n...I lost interest.\"\n\nBA DUM TSS!\n\nA few minutes later the dog stod up. Had a few smokes.

Being a nice guy he says to the business man, \"sure is a nice car you have there sir.\"  Being a pompous dick and not wanting to talk to a lowly old man riding a scooter, the business man flips him off, and rolls up the window.  He then decides, I am gonna show this old man how awesome me and my car really is.  As soon as the light goes green the business man floors the Ferrari attempting to leave him in the dust.  As he takes off the he looks in his rear view mirror and to his amazement he can see the old man on the scooter not far behind and gaining on him.  Not to be made a fool of the business man gives it all he's got accelerating to 100 mph.   He looks in his mirror again expecting the old man to be left behind but to his utter amazement the old man is still close behind and gaining!!  The business man is seriously humbled that this scooter could keep up and decides to stop and admit defeat to the ol coot.  The pair finally come to a stop and the business man rolls his window back down, \"sir I want to apologize for my behavior back there, I shouldn't have flipped you off and thought so poorly about you and your scooter.  You obviously have a good scooter that is just as amazing as my awesome car.\"  The old man almost out of breath and heart racing from going so fast says, \"no need to apologize, I was a little upset at first, but when you rolled your window up with my suspenders caught in there you gave me the feelings of excitement and adrenaline I haven't had in years!\"",

He always had to ask permission to do anything, was never allowed to play outside alone, and wasn't even allowed to stay home by himself.  One night Johnny's parents were going to an adult only wedding, so naturally, they got a baby sitter for Johnny.  The baby sitter was a junior in high school that lived down the road.  What these parents didn't know was that this baby sitter was an extremely... *easy* going girl.  She also happened to be Johnny's biggest crush.  So when she came over and his parents finally left, he began to try to charm her. After a night full of smooth talking, Johnny finally got the baby sitter's pants off.  He was right in the middle of becoming a man, when his mother bursts through the door an hour before originally stated.  In a state of horror and rage, the mother yells, \"JOHNNY DIGDEEPER!\" \n\nJohnny replies, \"I'M TRYING! I'M TRYING!\"",

The family had two twins who were both seniors in my class, Ving and Ling. Ving and his sister Ling were quiet to start off with, but eventually I made good friends with Ving. After talking to him for a few weeks he revealed to me that he absolutely abhored his name, and that he'd do almost anything to figure out how to get it changed. I asked him what he wanted to change it to, and he said\n\n\"lee, like bruce lee or some shit.\"\n\nI was failing trigonometry at the time, and so I thought what the hell, and offered to help him in exchange for him doing my homework. Ling overheard us and chimed in,\n\n\"If you do that, father will disown you as our child. That name has been in our family line for generations.\"\n\nVing never really listened to his sister though, and he still wanted to go through with the plan. The next day after school, I drove him to the town hall. After we arrived, he had gotten the name-change sheet and was scribbling down information on to it when I saw his face change. I could tell he was extremely conflicted with his choice. Tears began to stream down his face. He finally decided that he was gonna have to cancel his request, and Ling looked relieved. The receptionist let us know that there would be a cancelation fee, and handed the fee waiver to her. Suddenly, a short asian man with neon shorts, ray-bans, and an american flag t-shirt bursted into the room. Ving turned in awe and stared at the man, as tears rolled down his cheeks.\n\n\"D-D-Dad?\"\n\nWith a huge smile on his face, the man ran up and embraced his son.\n\n\n\"Don't stop, be Lee, Ving.

The usual signs...phone rings, but if I answer, the caller hangs up. My wife has been going out with the girls a lot recently, although when I ask their names she always says, \"Just some friends from work, you don't know them.\"\n\nI sometimes stay awake to look out for her cab coming home, but she always comes walking up the drive as I hear the sound of a car leaving, around the corner, as if she has gotten out and walked the rest of the way. Why? Maybe she wasn't in a taxi at all?\n\nI once picked up her cell phone, just to see what time it was. This caused her to go completely berserk. She quickly snatched the phone out of my hand and cursed me hysterically, screaming that I should never touch her personal property, then accused me of trying to spy on her.\n\nAnyway, I have never broached the subject with my wife. I think deep down I just didn't want to know the truth, but last night she went out again and I decided to really check on her. I decided I was going to park my Harley Davidson Lowrider next to the garage and then hide behind it so I could get a good view of the street around the corner when she came home. It was at that moment, crouching behind my motorcycle that I noticed a small amount of motor oil leaking through the gasket between the rear head and rocker arm cover.\n\nSo...is this something I can easily repair myself or do you think I should take it back to the dealer?",

The conductor ate the banana in regular fashion and braced himself for death. He was seated on the chair, fastened in, and was ready for what was about to happen.\n\nThe electricity was activated and the conductor was prepared. But, as before, the conductor was unhurt. The prison guard checked for any malfunctions but found nothing, not believing the entire situation was possible. In shock as before and not knowing what to do, the guard let the conductor go.\n\nThe conductor was, against all odds, alive and was still allowed to continue his job as a train conductor even though he was responsible for the death of almost two hundred people.\n\nHe was thankful to be allowed to continue his job but also scared. He would try not carefully from now on. However, this idea didn't help much as on the first train he was conducting after the chair, he managed to somehow crash yet another train. He was the only survivor of the train, which contained over a hundred people. He was trialed and, again, found guilty of the murder of over a hundred people. He was sentenced to death by electric chair.\n\nThe prison guard was the same, the surprise was the same, the procedure was the same. After giving the banana to the conductor, the guard was silent. He couldn't bring himself to say anything, all he could do was prepare the chair.\n\nThe man sat in the chair, expecting death. The guard activated it and, again, the conductor was unscathed. The prison guard couldn't contain himself. He simply had to ask, \"Sir, how did you manage to crash a train 3 times? And how did you survive the chair 3 times? Did the banana have something to do with it?\" The conductor responds with: \"No, I suppose I'm just not a good conductor.\"",

The man's curiosity was piqued, and he entered the shop. The store didn't seem to have much traffic, and the shelves were full of dusty, but interesting items. The man found himself strangely interested in a rather ugly brass rat on a shelf behind the counter. Ugly it was, but he had never seen anything like it -- it was so incredibly detailed, and life-like. He asked the shopkeeper for a price.\n\nThe man was pleased to learn that he could acquire the rat for only $5, and he handed the shopkeeper the money. But, before giving the man the rat, the shopkeeper sternly warned him, \"This sale is final. If you leave the shop with the brass rat, I won't take it back under any circumstances.\"\n\nThe man thought the warning was curious, given that the rat only cost $5. Even if he decided he hated the rat, that was hardly an amount worth worrying about. He agreed to the shopkeeper's terms, and left with the rat.\n\nAt first, everything seemed perfectly normal. But as he walked back toward his car, the man started to hear strange rustling noises around him. Then he saw a life rat scurry out of an alley, and start to follow him. Suddenly, rats seemed to be appearing all around him, streaming out of sewers and dumpsters, all following him and milling about his feet.\n\nThe man began to run, but the rats kept up in increasing numbers. The man realized that he was being chased by literally tens of thousands of rats. The ground came alive, as the rats swarmed behind him.\n\nThe man suddenly realized the significance of the shopkeeper's warning, and knew what he had to do. He turned toward the bay, and ran as quickly as he could toward the water. When he reached the waterfront, he threw the brass rat as far as he could into the bay. The rats raced past him, following the brass rat into the water, where they drowned.\n\nThe man returned to the curio shop, and upon seeing him enter the shopkeeper shouted, \"I told you, no refunds. I don't want trouble here. The sale was final, and you can't return the merchandise.\"\n\nThe man smiled, and replied, \"Oh, I don't want to return the rat. I just want to know -- do you have any brass lawyers?\"",

He'd just opened a pub, yet came to find that all the names he'd wanted were taken; The Queen's head, The King's Arms, so on so forth. Until he realised nobody had named a pub after the Queen's legs, and as such, he choose to name his pub 'The Queen's legs'.\n\nThe new barman opened his pub and found it to be quite a success, being the only pub for miles around. Indeed 'The Queen's legs' attracted drinkers from all the local villages. Though the most memorable customer was Alan.\n\nNow Alan was a quiet man, he kept to himself most days and nobody really knew where he was from, but he would come to the pub every day, rain or shine at exactly 8.00am, and would wait for one hour on the bench outside the church for the pub to open.\n\nNow the local bobby, a nice, respectable man named Peter noticed this. Every day on his morning rounds he saw Alan there, waiting on the bench. Peter had never seen him before, and never saw him elsewhere, and Peter prided himself on knowing everyone that lived in the village. One day, his curiosity got the better of him. He rolled down the window and said \"Mornin' sir, might I ask what it is you're doing out here? Only I've been seeing you a lot recently\"\n\nTo which Alan replied \"Morning mate! don't mind me, i'm just waiting for the Queen's legs to open so I can go in and 'ave a drink!\"\n\n",

I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster, too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. He can\u2019t build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women.

Jesus walks up to the bar, but it's closed for hygiene reasons and he goes next door to a hotel. He hands the receptionist a couple of nails and says \"Can you put me up for the night?\" The receptionist takes a moment to understand, not speaking Aramaic, but is able to explain in mime that nails are not legal tender. After Jesus leaves disgruntledly, a duck that has been kind of harrassing the receptionist for the last few days by asking for grapes waddles in. The duck asks if the receptionist has any nails, and the receptionist finally snaps. Deciding to walk out on the most ludicrous workday of his life, receptionist goes to the bar, and is infuriated to find it closed. He jimmies open a window, not caring who sees. But two old friends across the street, a priest and a rabbi, DO see. They decide they should do something to calm this agitated man down, and follow him into the bar. The bartender, having spent all day cleaning up after the horse, sees the receptionist, the priest and the rabbi come into the bar, and stops scrubbing shit long enough to ask \"Is this some kind of a joke?\"",

The man asked the carrot to put the rod in the trunk of the car for now. As the carrot pulled the rod out of the box, the old man looked at him carrying it precariously by the thinner end, and began to worry it was going to snap -- and as the carrot headed toward the door, the old man shouted out, 'That's naht tha whay ya care it!' -- the carrot, exasperated, screamed back, \"What do you mean that's not the way!

Having a good sense of smell, and not a stranger to the occasional toke, he follows it to the source and comes to the base of a truly mighty tree. High up in the branches is a monkey smoking a joint.\n\n\"Hey monkey\" he yells. \n\nThe monkey looks around for a while before finally he sees the lizard. The monkey's eyes are extremely red - this is the stonedest animal the lizard has ever seen. \"Hey man\" says the monkey. \n\n\"Can I get a hit?\" asks the lizard.\n\n\"Sure\" says the monkey, and our lizard friend climbs up the tree. The monkey offers him the spliff - it's king size, rolled out of a banana leaf. The lizard takes a long toke and it's really good. Nice thick smoke, with a slight taste of mango.\n\nThe two animals sit in a comfortable silence and smoke the joint to the butt. The lizard has rarely been this high before - either through weed or in terms of elevation. The sun is starting to go down, the canopy of the trees are lit with the brilliant reddish-gold of the sun, flocks of toucans are flying past, everything is at peace with the world.\n\nHe's in a great place, an hour passes and he starts to realise his mouth is extremely dry. He tries to ignore it for as long as possible, but he just can't forget about it. \"Hey man\", he says to the monkey, \"I've got the dries real bad. I've got to get a drink of water\".\n\nThe monkey says \"there's a river only a few minutes away. It's over there\" pointing off to the south. \"I'm about to roll another one, but I'll wait for you if you like\".\n\n\"Thanks. I'll be back soon\" says the lizard and starts climbing down the tree. The change from horizontal to vertical is a bit disorientating, not to mention he's high as a kite and hearing sounds like it's the first time he's ever heard them. He carefully makes his way down the tree, hesitates for a minute while he tries to remember which way the monkey had pointed, feels confident he remembers and ambles off through the bushes.\n\nA few minutes later to his relief he he hears the sound of a slow moving river, and comes to a clearing where the sunlight is twinkling off the surface of a slow moving but wide river. The meandering water makes a soothing sound, the lizard is so incredibly calm that he doesn't notice that he log half submerged near the bank isn't a log at all.\n\nThe lizard ambles forward, and starts to take his much desired drink when the log quickly whips around - it's an enormous crocodile! Being in his calm and altered state, and totally not expecting this,  the lizard struggles to process what is happening and just stands there, still drinking and looking at the croc with a quizzical look on his face.\n\nThe croc is a bit stunned - normally animals try to get the hell away from his jaws of death as quickly as possible, but the lizard is just standing there, giving him a look of disbelief with his extremely red eyes. It takes a second, but the croc gets it.\n\n\"You are high, aren't you?\" he asks with a smile.\n\n\"..yeah..\" giggles the lizard, feeling a bit self concious.\n\n\"You got any weed?\" asks the dangerous croc.\n\n\"Nah\" says the lizard, \"but I know where you can get some\" as the reality of the situation starts becoming apparent - he's inches away from the most deadly animal in the jungle, and he might be able to get away with his life. \"I tell you what, if you promise not to eat me, I'll tell you how to find the guy with the stash\".\n\n\"Deal\" says the croc.\n\nThe lizard says \"go that way for abut 5 minutes, look for the biggest tree you can find. In it is a monkey with the dankest pot you've ever seen\".\n\n\"Thanks\" says the croc, and dragging his massive bulk onto the shore starts walking in the direction the lizard is pointing. Thanking his lucky stars, the lizard figures he's had enough adventure for the day, and heads off home and out of the story.\n\nThe croc walks for a few minutes, and he sees the monkey. a joint and cloud of smoke coming from the branches of a tree. \n\n\"Hey monkey\" he yells.\n\n\"Sorry man, but you were taking too long, so I......\" starts the monkey before looking down and seeing the enormous reptile at the base of the tree. His eyes pop out of his head in surprise.\n\n\"Holy shit\" he exclaims. \"How much did you drink?\"",

He didn't have any money so he told the bus driver he would get the money form home when they arrived. When they got there the goat exited the bus and quickly ran laughing.\nThe after that, Dog also took the bus. Thinking about how he was scammed yesterday, the bus driver told him he had no change for his bills but would be right back. Dog waited and waited, but the bus never came back.\n\nThis is explains why a cow on the road won't move for the bus: it has no business with the driver. Goats will always run away, as they are afraid the driver will demand his money. Dogs are the opposite: they will come from all over the village to chase the bus, trying to get their money.",

I suppose it is at least equally possible,\" he added after a moment's reflection, \"that British Rail had got the time of the train wrong. Hadn't occurred to me before.\"\n\n             \"Get on with it.\" Fenchurch laughed. \n\n\"So I bought a newspaper, to do the crossword, and went to the buffet to get a cup of coffee.\"\n\n \t\"You do the crossword?\"\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n \t\"Which one?\"\n\n \"The Guardian usually.\"\n\n \t\"I think it tries to be too cute. I prefer The Times.  Did you solve it?\" \n\n\"What?\" \n\n\t\"The crossword in The Guardian.\"\n\n \"I haven't had a chance to look at it yet,\" said Arthur. \"I'm still trying to buy the coffee.\"\n\n \t\"All right then. Buy the coffee.\" \n\n\"I'm buying it. I am also,\" said Arthur, \"buying some biscuits.\" \n\n\t\"What sort?\" \n\n\"Rich Tea.\" \n\n\t\"Good choice.\"\n\n \"I like them.\" Laden with all these new possessions, I go and sit at a table. And don't ask me what the table was like because this was some time ago and I can't remember. It was probably round.\" \n\n\t\"All right.\"\n\n \"So let me give you the layout. Me sitting at the table, on my left, the newspaper, on my right, the cup of coffee, in the middle of the table, the packet of biscuits.\" \n\n\t\"I see it perfectly.\"\n\n \"What you don't see,\" said Arthur, \"because I haven't mentioned him yet, is the guy sitting at the table already. He is sitting there opposite me.\" \n\n\t\"What's he like?\"\n\n \"Perfectly ordinary. Briefcase. Business suit. He didn't look,\" said Arthur, \"as if he was about to do anything weird.\" \n\n\t\"Ah. I know the type. What did he do?\"\n\n \"He did this. He leaned across the table, picked up the packet of biscuits, tore it open, took one out, and . . .\"\n\n \t\"What?\" \n\n\"Ate it.\"\n\n \t\"What?\"\n\n \"He ate it.\"\n\n \tFenchurch looked at him in astonishment. \"What on earth did     you do?\" \n\n\"Well, in the circumstances I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do. I was compelled,\" said Arthur, \"to ignore it.\"\n\n \t\"What? Why?\"\n\n \"Well, it's not the sort of thing you're trained for, is it? I searched my soul, and discovered that there was nothing anywhere in my upbringing, experience, or even primal instincts to tell me how to react to someone who has quite simply, calmly, sitting right there in front of me, stolen one of my biscuits.\"\n\n\t\"Well, you could . . .\" Fenchurch thought about it.\n\n\t\"I must say I'm not sure what I would have done either. So what happened?\"\n\n\"I stared furiously at the crossword,\" said Arthur, \"couldn't do a single clue, took a sip of coffee, it was too hot to drink, so there was nothing for it. I braced myself. I took a biscuit, trying very hard not to notice,\" he added, \"that the packet was already mysteriously open. . . .\"\n\n\t \"But you're fighting back, taking a tough line.\"\n\n\"After my fashion, yes. I ate the biscuit. I ate it very deliberately and visibly, so that he would have no doubt as to what it was I was doing. When I eat a biscuit,\" said Arthur, \"it stays eaten.\"\n\n\t\"So what did he do?\"\n\n\"Took another one. Honestly,\" insisted Arthur, \"this is exactly what happened. He took another biscuit, he ate it. Clear as daylight. Certain as we are sitting on the ground.\"\n\n \tFenchurch stirred uncomfortably. \n\n\"And the problem was,\" said Arthur, \"that having not said anything the first time, it was somehow even more difficult to broach the subject the second time around. What do you say? 'Excuse me ...I couldn't help noticing, er . . .' \n\nDoesn't work. No, I ignored it with, if anything, even more vigor than previously.\"\n\n  \t\"My man .. .\" \n\n\"Stared at the crossword again, still couldn't budge a bit of it, so showing some of the spirit that Henry V did on St. Crispin's Day . .\" \n\n \t \"What?\" \n\n\"I went into the breach again. I took,\" said Arthur, \"an-other biscuit. And for an instant our eyes met.\"\n\n \t \"Like this?\" \n\n\"Yes, well, no, not quite like that. But they met. Just for an instant. And we both looked away. But I am here to tell you,\" said Arthur,  \"that there was a little electricity in the air. There was a little tension building up over the table. At about this time.\"\n\n\t \"I can imagine.\"\u201d\n\n\"We went through the whole packet like this. Him, me, him, me . . .\"\n\n  \t\"The whole packet?\" \n\n\"Well, it was only eight biscuits, but it seemed like a lifetime of biscuits we were getting through at this point. Gladiators could hardly have had a tougher time.\"\n\n   \t\"Gladiators,\" said Fenchurch, \"would have had to do it in the sun. More physically gruelling.\"\n \n\"There is that. So. When the empty packet was lying dead \nbetween us the man at last got up, having done his worst, and left. I heaved a sigh of relief, of course. \n\n\"As it happened, my train was announced a moment or two later, so I finished my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper . . .\" \n\n   \t\"Yes?\" \n\n\"Were my biscuits.\" \n\n   \t\"What?\" said Fenchurch. \"What?\"\n\n\"True.\"\n\n \t  \"No!\"\n\nThe thing I like particularly about this story is the sensation that somewhere in England there has been wandering around for the last quarter-century a perfectly ordinary guy who\u2019s had the same exact story, only he doesn\u2019t have the punch line.",

The doctor thought for a moment and said \"Hmm, tricky situation. But I have a solution to the problem if young sir would permit.\"  The husband being very concerned agreed that the doctor could use whatever method to get the bee out of his wife's vagina.  The doctor said \"OK, what I'm gonna do is rub some honey over the top of my penis and insert it into your wife's vagina. When I feel the bee getting closer to the tip of my penis I shall withdraw it and the bee should hopefully follow my penis out of your wife's vagina. The husband nodded and gave his approval. The young lady said \"Yes, Yes, whatever, just get on with it.\" So the doctor, after covering the tip of his penis with honey, inserted it into the young lady's vagina.  After a few gentle strokes, the doctor said, \"I don't think the bee has noticed the honey yet. Perhaps I should go a bit deeper.\"  So the doctor went deeper and deeper.  After a while the doctor began shafting the young lady very hard indeed. The young lady began to quiver with excitement.  She began to moan and groan aloud. The doctor, concentrating very hard, looked like he was enjoying himself, he then put his hands on the young lady's breasts and started making loud noises. The husband at this point suddenly became very annoyed and shouted, \"Now wait a minute! What the Hell do you think you're doing?\"  The doctor, still concentrating, replied, \"Change of plan.

Unwilling to leave any living witnesses behind, Artie had no choice but to strangle the produce manager as well.\n\n       However, unknown to Artie, the entire proceedings were captured by the hidden security cameras and observed by the store's security guard, who immediately called the police.

When she woke up from the surgery, she saw no difference at all!  After recovering, she said to the surgeon, \"I don't understand it!  Why doesn't my chest look any different??\"\n\nThe surgeon replies, \"This was a special kind of surgery--we are testing a prototype push-button pump.\"  \"How does it work?\" she asks, puzzled.  The surgeon says, \"Remember those Reebok 'pump' shoes from the 90s?  Well, under your arm is a similar pump.  Just flap your arms like this (*flap your arms like a chicken*) and your breasts will gradually inflate with each pump.\n\nSo the woman tries it and is amazed by how she looks.  She is further amazed by the fact that she can inflate herself a little or a lot, depending on how she wants to look.\n\nSo the next day she goes to a bar, feeling super confident.  She sees a very handsome, well-dressed man sitting by himself at a table, so she goes up to him and says (*flap your arms like a chicken while saying what she says*), \"Hello there, I'm Cindy!  What's your name?\"\n\nThe man says, (*now bend your knees slightly and flap them together while you say this-->*) \"My name is Mike!  Nice to meet you!\"\n\n\n(The joke, of course, is that the knee-flapping makes it look like the guy had penis enlargement surgery using the same pumping device.)",

It must have been a Tuesday because the only other people there were the bartender and a stranger who was drinking quite heavily at the bar. \n\nAfter taking in the view and snapping some photographs the tourist orders a drink from the bartender and engages the stranger in small talk.\n\nEventually the stranger turns to the tourist and says \"You know, last week I discovered that if you jump from the top of this building, by the time you fall to the 10th floor, the winds around the building are so intense that they carry you around the building and back into the window.\" \n\nHearing this, the bartender just shakes his head disapprovingly while continuing to clean a glass. \n\nThe tourist responds, \"What, are you nuts!? there is no way that is true!\" The Stranger says \"No, seriously it is absolutely true, and I'll prove it to you!\" He gets up from the bar, jumps over the balcony, and plummets towards the street below. When he passes the 10th floor, the high wind whips him around the building and back into the 10th floor window and he takes the elevator back up to the bar. He meets the Tourist, who looks quite astonished.\n\n\"You know, I saw that with my own eyes, but that must have been a one time fluke.\" Says the tourist. \"No, I'll prove it again,\" says the Strandger as he jumps over once more. Again just as he is hurtling toward the street, the 10th floor wind gently carries him around the building and into the window. \n\nOnce the stranger get's upstairs again the tourist is adamant that he must try this once in a lifetime experience for himself and insists that the stranger takes his camera to capture the event for his friends back home. The stranger agrees, and the tourist flings himself over the balcony! He rushes past the 12th floor, 11th, 10th...... 9th, 8th floors..... and hits the pavement with a huuuuge splat!\n\nBack upstairs the bartender turns to the stranger and says: \"You know what Superman, you are a real asshole when you're drunk!\"",

Next, you see that group of mean old bikers in the back? They come in every night and make a big mess. I need you to take one of these beer bottles and smash it over one of their heads.

She was a whore in Romania for almost 35 years. I need you to go upstairs and have your way with her.\"\n\nSo the man races down the beers and shots in under 8 minutes, to the amazement of the bar keep. He grabs one of the beer bottles and walks up to the biggest biker in the back and smashes it over his head, knocking him out cold. A few of the other bikers rough him up a bit but he keeps going. He stumbles out side and from inside the bar, all the barkeep hears is the most horrible screaming and yelping he has ever heard. After what seems like an hour, the man comes back in, clothes torn to bits and bloodied and rushes to the bar keep and slurrs out,\n\n\"Now wheresh that old whore with the bad tooth????\"",

The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.\" \n\nJoe was shocked and depressed. He woundered if he had anything to live for. He couldn\u2019t concentrate long enough to answer, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife.

He could make a new beginning and live a new life. He saw a men\u2019s clothing store and thought, \"that\u2019s what I need .. a new suit.\" \n\nHe entered the shop and told the salesman, \"I\u2019d like a new suit.\" The elderly tailor eyed him briefly and said, \"Let\u2019s see... size 42 long.\" Joe laughed, \"That\u2019s right, how did you know?\" \"Been in business 60 years!\" Joe tried on the suit. It fit perfectly. As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, \"how about a new shirt?\" Joe thought for a moment and then said \"sure...\" The salesman eyed Joe and said \"let\u2019s see...34 sleeves and...16 and a half neck.\" Joe was suprised, \"that\u2019s right, how did you know?\" \"Been in the business 60 years\" Joe tried one the shirt, and it fit perfectly. As Joe adjusted the collar in the mirror, the salesman asked \"how about some new shoes?\" Joe was on a roll and said \"sure!\" \n\nThe salesman eyed Joe\u2019s feet and said \"Let\u2019s see... 10-1/2...E.\" Joe said astonished, \"that\u2019s right, how did you know?\" \"Been in business 60 years!\" Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly.

I got you I\u2019ve worn a size 34 since I was 18 years old.\" \"The salesman shook his head, \"you can\u2019t wear a size 34, it will press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache.\"",

But lately, Bill's performance has been worsening, and he rarely wins a race.\n\nBob and Bill's owner comes into the stable to have a chat with Bill. \"Bill,\" he says, \"times are tough on my ranch. You have done well for me so many times, so it pains me to say this, but unless you win one of the next three races, I'll have to sell you. If I can find another trainer, I will, but if not, it'll be the glue factory for you. Think about it, and do your best in the races.\"\n\nWith that he leaves. Bob is shocked. He turns to Bill and says, \"what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I'll do the best I can, but my strongest competition out there is going to be you,\" says Bill. \"Please, show your old friend some kindness and help me out?\"\n\n\"Of course, old friend,\" says Bob.\n\nThe next Saturday is the day of the August race. The sun is shining brightly. The women are wearing bright sun dresses and white hats, while the men have rolled up their shirtsleeves. A gentle breeze blows over the track as the race is about to begin. \n\nAnd they're off! Bob and Bill are in the thick of the pack. Bill moves steadily upwards, followed by Bob. At the first turn, Bill emerges in the lead! His heart is racing, his breathing is heavy, his jockey is whipping swiftly. But then, Bob pulls up close behind. He gallops and easily overtakes his friend at the last turn. At the end of the race, Bob wins by three lengths.\n\nAt the stable that evening, the owner comes back. \"That was a good effort Bill,\" he says, \"but not good enough. I will give you two more chances, though, to prove you have what it takes to win. Good luck.\" He leaves.\n\nBill turns to Bob. \"What happened?\" he asks. \"I thought we had an agreement.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Bill,\" says Bob. \"I don't know what came over me. The excitement of the race, the crowds cheering. I promise next time, you will win.\"\n\nThen the time comes for the Saturday of the September race. The sun is hidden behind scattered clouds. The women are wearing grey dresses and clutching their hats against the wind, while the men wear light jackets. A chilly breeze blows over the track as the race is about to begin. \n\nAnd they're off! Bob and Bill are in the back of the pack. Bill struggles to maintain his position. At the first turn, Bill begins to pull up. At the last turn, Bill emerges in the lead! His heart is pounding, he gasps for air, his jockey is whipping fervently. But then, Bob pulls up behind once again. He thunders ahead and eventually overtakes Bill in the final stretch. At the end of the race, Bob wins by one length.\n\nAt the stable that evening, the owner comes back. \"That was another great effort Bill,\" he says, \"but not great enough. I will give you one more chance, though, to prove you have what it takes to win. Good luck.\" He leaves.\n\nBill turns to Bob. \"What happened?\" he asks. \"It can't be a coincidence, to happen twice like that.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Bill,\" says Bob. \"I don't know what came over me. The thrill of the race, the crowds roaring. I wouldn't do this to you on purpose, please believe me.\"\n\n\"I believe you,\" says Bill.\n\nThen the time comes for the Saturday of the October race. The sky is completely overcast, and dark clouds are gathering on the horizon. The women are wearing heavy coats and carrying umbrellas to shield themselves from the light rain, while the men are weaing long trenchcoats. A strong gust blows over the track as the race is about to begin. \n\nAnd they're off! Bob and Bill are in the rear of the pack. Bill falls behind, trailing behind the pack. He musters all his strength, throwing his hooves forward with all his might. \"I can do this, I must!\" At the first turn, he reaches the middle of the pack! At the last turn, he is in the lead! His heart is throbbing, his lungs are burning, his jockey is whipping angrily. Every muscle is sore and struggling. But then, in the final stretch, Bob pulls up behind for a final time. He gallops ferociously barely overtakes Bill at the finishing line. At the end of the race, Bob wins by a nose.\n\nAt the stable that day, the owner comes back. \"That was an amazing effort Bill, the best I have ever seen,\" he says, \"but not amazing enough. I cannot keep a horse that cannot win a race. Tonight, you will be taken away.\" He leaves.\n\nBill turns to Bob, but no words come to his lips. He is overcome with emotion. He looks back on his long career, and his many wins. He wants to be angry at Bob, but he can't be. He is proud of his friend and protege for winning three races, and knows that Bob will go on to great things. But he is filled with sadness that he will not be there to experience them with his friend. His time with Bob, and perhaps, his life, are at an end.\n\nJust then, one of the ranch dogs enter the stable. He looks up at Bill. \"Bill,\" he says, \"we just heard what happened. What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" says Bill. The dog, whose attention span is short, wanders off.\n\nThen Bill, at last, knows what to say. He turns to Bob and says, \"holy shit, did you see that? A talking dog!\"",

He also can't help but notice that this little man appears to have an enormous penis.\n\nThe man in green sees the guy looking at him and says, in a thick Irish accent, \"You see someting you like, lad?\"\n\nThe man is embarrassed and apologizes. \"Sorry, I didn't mean to stare. It's just, I hope you don't mind me asking (he's a bit drunk), but how is it that a guy of your size is so well endowed?\"\n\nThe little man lets out a mischievous giggle. \"Well you see,\" he says, \"it's because I'm a Leprechaun. That's just how we are.\"\n\nThe man laughs. \"Well seeing you're a Leprechaun, aren't you supposed to grant me wishes or something?\"   \n\n\"Aye\" The Leprechaun responds. \"You get t'ree\"\n\nThe man, not believing, plays along. \"OK. I wish for a bag of gold.\"\n\n\"Granted.\" says the leprechaun. He reaches into his coat and produces a little bag filled with gold coins, and hands it over.\n\nThe man, looking into the bag, is shocked. \"What the...\" Unable to believe his eyes, he decides to test the little man again.  \"OK. my next wish is for my hair to grow back.\" (he's bald)\n\nThe Leprechaun says, \"bend your head down and I'll make it so.\" And he rubs his hands together vigorously and lays them on top of the man's bald head. \"By tomorrow morning, you'll notice that your hair has started to grow back. \n\nAlready the man can feel his head tingling, and he starts to feel overcome with joy over his good fortune.\n\n\"One more\" the leprechaun says. \n\n\"Alright, the man says, his heart racing. OK, for my last wish, I want a penis as big as yours.\"\n\nThe leprechaun smiles and scratches his chin. \"Well, lad, I can make that come true, but it's a wee bit more involved, and you aren't going to like it.\" His eyes sparkle with delight. \"You'll have to let me fuck you in the arse.\"\n\nThis comes as something of a shock to the man, but he looks at the bag of gold in his hand, feels his tingling head, looks around the empty bathroom and says, \"well, as long as nobody knows, and it's over quickly.\"\n\n\"Not a soul will be told\" the leprechaun says. \n\nSo the guy turns around, pulls his pants down, and the leprechaun starts going for it. \n\nA minute or so in, the man starts to moan, \"Oooooh god... yes. Oh fuck!\"\n\nThe Leprechaun is encouraged and starts to grunt louder, \"Mmmmmm uhn, uhn, uhn.\" He traces the man's inner thigh and then gently cups his testicles. \n\nThe man gasps out, \"NNnnnngggaaaahhhh  oooOooOoo yeah...\" and starts convulsing as he ejaculates. He feels the leprechaun cumming inside him and grips the sides of the urinal to keep himself from collapsing to the floor in ecstasy. \n\nAfter a moment, the leprechaun is finished. He leans his weight against the man, pushing himself deep one last time, then falls forward onto the man's lower back.\n\nThe bathroom is silent but for the synchronized breath of the sudden lovers. They are frozen together, afraid to move lest it signal time to resume its inexorable march to reality, neither of them quite ready to let the moment end, neither of them yet willing to come to terms with the meaning of what had just occurred.\n  ",

However, their manager got the dates wrong and the group ended up doing a three-day run in an outdoor theater in Albuquerque in the middle of the July heat. The event was exhausting and by the third night, everyone was just hoping to survive one more concert and move on. \n\nDuring the last song - Beethoven's Ninth - the bass players in the back of the orchestra hatch a plan. There's a bit in the middle of the song that's all violins and flutes, surely they won't be missed. They decide to sneak out to the bar next door for a drink, 'just to keep hydrated.'\n\nThey stay a little longer than they should have, and drink a lot more than they would have, when one of them realizes that they are going to miss their entrance. The ring-leader of the group tells them to not worry, as he had the foresight to tie the last page of the score down with a bit of string. It will take the conductor a while to unite it, which means the concert will stop and they can sneak in. They drunkingly congratulate him for being so smart as they stumble back to the theater. \n\nMeanwhile, the conductor is in a bind. The very energetic end of the piece is coming up and his bass section is missing. The violinists are working up a sweat trying to keep up in the heat when suddenly the first violinist faints from heat exhaustion. This is the last straw for the second violinist and she faints too. The bass section begins stumbling in not so subtly as they are knocking people, instruments, and chairs over.  To top it all off, someone has tied down the last page of the score as he is desperately trying to flip the page.\n\nIt would do us good to sympathize with the conductor and put ourselves in his shoes. From his vantage point, he begins to realize that:\n\nThere are two out, at the end of the ninth\n\nThe score is tied\n\nAnd the basses are loaded.",

I will burn gum-tree leaves for magic aroma and have s\u00e9ance.  Then after three days, hen will no longer be bald.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Ming was unsuccessful.  So the farmer called his other Chinese friend Hing and explained what was wrong with the hen.  Hing says, \"I have solution.  I get all my relatives over to my house and we work together to make special tea out of gum-tree leaves.  Then I give tea to you.  You pour on the skin of the hen and after three days hen will regrow a coat.\"\n\nThe farmer was given the special tea and did just as his Chinese friend instructed.  But alas, the hen remained bald and the plan failed.\n\nSo what's the moral of the story?  All of Ming's corpses and all of Hing's kin couldn't use gum-tree to feather a hen.",

I went and spent it already.'\nChuck said, 'OK, then, just bring me the dead donkey.'\nThe farmer asked, 'What ya gonna do with him?\nChuck said, 'I'm going to raffle him off.'\nThe farmer said 'You can't raffle off a dead donkey!'\nChuck said, 'Sure I can, watch me. I just won't tell anybody he's dead.'\n\nA month later, the farmer met up with Chuck and asked, 'What happened with the dead donkey?'\nChuck said, 'I raffled him off. I sold 500 tickets at two dollars apiece and made a profit of $898.00.'\nThe farmer said, 'Didn't anyone complain?'\nChuck said, 'Just the guy who won. So I gave him his two dollars back.'\n\nChuck now works on Wall Street.",

        "body": "In a large city, far from the hustle and bustle of the commoners, stood a large mansion. It was an elaborate mansion, and it was owned by one of the wealthiest men in all of the state. Its main feature was a large glass window that reflected the world beautiful. In order to keep this window clean, however, biweekly cleanings were required, and a group of three men were hired every so often to clean it. This particular group of men consisted of a white man, a black man, and a Chinese man.\n\nNow, there's one other thing to know about this mansion. Along with its owner, his daughter lived inside the mansion with her father. Sadly, one day, the father passed away, and the woman was left with a huge mansion to live in. She inherited everything from her father--every last cent!--but there was one catch: she needed to be married in order to receive anything at all. The woman, at the time of her father's unexpected death, was not even *dating*, let alone *married*. This was a problem--the woman wanted the money and mansion. So, one day as the three men washed the window, she walked up to them from the inside of the house, naked. She held up a piece of paper with writing on it to them, and it read as follows:\n\n\"I am the daughter of the person who owned this house. He has recently passed, and I will get it once his will is read. However, I need to be married, and that's where I need your help. I will take each of you, one at a time, to my bedroom, and we will have sex. Whoever can make me scream the most, I will marry.\"\n\nNow, the three men looked at each other. Could it be real? They couldn't believe it.\n\n\"I want to go first,\" said the white guy.\n\n\"I'll go last,\" said the Chinese man. The black simply nodded, and so the white man walked inside the house. After about 20 minutes had passed, the Chinese and black guys heard something faintly from inside the house. A minute later, the white guy comes out, grinning.\n\n\"Good luck,\" he says, patting his black coworker on the back as he walks in. At this moment, the Chinese guy walks away from the other two, and from what can be seen, he looks like he is masturbating. The white guy notices this, but says nothing. After ten minutes, a noise much more audible than what had previously been heard came from within. The white guy hung his head, knowing he would not marry the gorgeous woman. The black guy came out, and the Chinese man went in without a word. The black man is confident--surely that small-dicked *Chinese* guy couldn't do better than him! However, not even one minute passes before the white and black guys can hear the loudest screams they'd ever heard from anyone. The two look at each other in surprise, unsure of what the hell just happened. They run in, thinking that perhaps their coworker had done something violent. As they reach the woman's door, the Chinese guy steps out, with a smile stretching from ear to ear. \n\n\"What the hell did you do?\" asks the white guy. The Chinese guy simply continues to grin, but after a moment, decides to answer in a sing-song voice:\n\n\"Me Chinese, me so slick, me put Windex on my dick!\"\n\n(Sorry, Chinese people, if this is offensive. I know that's a terrible stereotype, but that's how the joke goes.)",

He offers the mime \n a job to dress up as the gorilla until they can get another one.

Of course, this makes the lion furious, but the crowd loves \n it. At the end of the day the zoo keeper comes and gives the mime a raise for being such a good attraction. Well, this goes on \n for some time, the mime keeps taunting the lion, the crowds grow larger, and his salary keeps going up. Then one terrible day \n when he is dangling over the furious lion he slips and falls. The mime is terrified. \n The lion gathers itself and prepares to pounce. The mime is so scared that he begins to run round and round the cage with the \n lion close behind. Finally, the mime starts screaming and yelling, \"Help, Help me!\", but the lion is quick and pounces.

An old farmer, a tractor driver and hero of Terry's stopped him in the street and said \"Isn't it about time you grew up a bit lad and stopped wasting your life obsessing over tractors?\" Terry had developed a thick skin over the years when it came to ignoring the haters but he knew that this man was no hater, he was a tractor lover and had Terry's best interests at heart. \n\nAfter a couple of days of deep thought and soul searching Terry made his decision. The posters were ripped down, the bed spread put on ebay, the toys sent to a local charity shop. It was done. He was now a man.\n\nSomewhat perplexed by his sudden lack of tractor entertainment options Terry decided to visit a pub for the first time. He wandered in, ordered a pint and took up residence in the corner of the pub.\n\nShortly after arriving Terry noticed a bit of commotion over by the bar *note this was in the days before the smoking ban*. A towel left too close to the ashtray had caught fire on a cigarette ember. Smoke rapidly began to fill the room and despite the bar staff successfully extinguishing the fire and wafting vigorously they were soon left with no option but to order everyone out of the bar.\n\nJust as people began to leave Terry stood up. \"wait\" he shouted, everyone watched as he ran over to where the smoke was the thickest and took in a huge breath inhaling all the smoke! He then ran to the window, opened it and blew all the smoke outside before returning to his original seat.\n\n\"Incredible\", \"unbelievable\", \"how on earth did you do that!?\" came the cries.\n\n\"Well\" explained Terry \"you see I'm an ex-tractor-fan\"",

        "body": "So a guy walks into a bar one day and he can\u2019t believe his eyes. There, in the corner, there\u2019s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.\n\nSo the guy asks the bartender, \u201cWhere\u2019d he come from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThere\u2019s a genie in the men\u2019s room who grants wishes.\u201d\n\nSo the guy runs into the men\u2019s room and, sure enough, there\u2019s this genie. And the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d So the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cO.K., I wish for world peace.\u201d And there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and then the room fills up with geese.\n\nSo the guy walks out of the men\u2019s room and he\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nSo the guy processes this. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cDoes that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cYeah. Why, what did you wish for?\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWorld peace.\u201d\n\nSo the bartender is understandably ashamed.\n\nAnd the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it\u2019s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI feel like I should explain myself further.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nBut the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\n\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.\n\nSo the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nAnd then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s just grab a beer. It\u2019s on me.\u201d \n\nEdit: Credit - http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/11/18/guy-walks-into-a-bar",

After reaching the village at the foothills of the mountains, he climbed his way to the peak.... At the top of the peak he noticed a 10ft high brick wall surrounding it. Perplexed he walked all around the wall to find a portion where a few bricks had been pulled out to form footholds and a rope hanging over the wall. The man scaled the wall using the rope and jumped over to see an amazing sight.\n\nA small hut with a tiny pond . He entered the hut and there he saw the hermit. The hermit was in deep meditation and was irked by his disturbance. The man lay prostrate and narrated his problem with folded hands. The hermit took pity on him and told him \" My son, dip your dick twice in the magical pond and you shall receive what you need\". The man hurridly rushed out to do as the hermit said and Lo! he now had 13 inch long weiner! Excited he scaled down the mountains and spent his night at the village brothel.\n\n After exhausting all the women in brothel he proceeded the next day to visit the hermit and thank him. He climbed the mountains, used the rope to scale the wall and entered the hermit's home. Overjoyed with gratitude the man thanked the hermit profusely . The man while leaving asked the Hermit that if his penis was 13 inches long how long was the Hermit's ? \n\nThe hermit replied \" Check that rope again\".\n\n( p.s. this is my first post ! upvote if you like fellow redditors ! )\n",

        "body": "A travelling salesman is driving along a dusty backroad to his next sale, when his car starts belching smoke. He sees storm clouds coming his way and night is falling soon. Getting out of the car he looks around for shelter and sees an antiquated old monastery on a hill not 5 minutes walk away. He heads over and knocks on the door just as the rain starts falling and a kindly monk answers.\n\"Hi, my car is broken down on the road\" says the salesman, \"and I see a storm coming in. Can I stay the night and call a tow truck in the morning? I won't be any trouble...\"\n\"not at all my good man\" the kindly monk replied, \"Come in! Come in! Lets get you a hot meal and some dry clothes!\"\n\nSo the salesman is ushered into the church and given a wonderful bowl of hearty stew and bread to eat. Not realizing his hunger before the salesman devours the food in between words of thanks.\n\"I don't know how I can repay you people...\"\n\"well actually\" said the kindly monk who answered the door, \"our abbot bores so easily in the realitive solitude of our church, and he loves to talk with travelers\"\n\"of course!\" replied the salesman, \"in return for this hospitality its the least i could do\"\n\nSo the kindly monk leads the salesman deeper into the monastery and as he does he hears the faintest sound...\nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...\nBut the salesman thinks its just the storm outside making noise and pays it no mind. He reaches the abbots quarters and meets a man seemingly as ancient as the building he runs who greets him with a smile and firm handshake.\nThe two speak to each other at length with hours seeming like minutes as the storm pounds the outside, and all the while the man hears that same noise...\nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...\n\nEventually the conversation draws to a natural end and the abbot looks over the salesman's shoulder.\n\"good heavens, look at the time. we both should get some rest\" the abbot commented, \"the brother you met before will take you to your chambers for the night\"\n\nAnd so the salesman is taken to his spartan looking accommodations, and just as the kindly monk is leaving the room the salesman asks,\n\"by the way, i keep hearing this strange thumping sound all the time. Its that normal? What is that?\"\nThe monk looks down at his feet, and for the first time since the salesman came into the monastery the smile falls from his face. He quickly stares at the floor and stammers,\n\"I-I-I don't know what you're talking about. Sleep well.\" Slamming the door behind him.\n\nThe salesmans sleep is restless as now the same sound as before stays next to him, breathing on his neck....\nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...\nWhen dawn breaks the salesman calls a tow truck, and while waiting says his goodbyes and thank yous. Finally when the tow truck arrives he turns to the abbot and says,\n\"thank you so much for everything again, but I must ask; what is that strange thudding noise I hear? The storm is over yet I heard it clearly all night?\"\nThe monk gains a sudden steel in his eyes and locks them dead onto the salesman.\n\"I can't tell you, you're not a monk.\"\nAnd with that, bids him farewell.\n\nThe salesman finishes his route without incident, and heads home to his wife and child. But incessantly, as if by hearing it he could no longer un-hear it, at the quietest moments in his life, the salesman hears a soft\nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...\n\nThe seasons pass into years and the years pass into decades. The mans son grows and leaves to be his own man, and after decades of bliss the mans wife passes away peacefully in his arms one morning. As the life leaves his loves eyes the only sound heard is a simple\nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...\n\nWith a life now emptier the thudding becomes constant, unceasing, droning. When he sleeps, eats, shits\nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...\n\nFinally, standing it no longer the man drives all day and night to the same dirt road he so happened to break down upon and every mile, every town he passes as constant as the odometer\nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...\n\nFinally he reaches the monastery and knocks on the door and just as before a fresh faced kinly monk answers.\n\"I WISH TO JOIN YOUR ORDER\" the man blurts before the monk can say anything. The monk gains a knowing smile and says no more, beckoning the man to follow him.\n\nHe leads the man on the same path he took those years and years before and directs him into the abbots room. Inside is the same man as the night he stayed before, looking not a day older.\n\"Please abbot.\" The man begged, \"I can't stop hearing that thudding noise, night and day I can't escape it. Can't you let me know what it is?\"\nThe abbot replies with the same steely matter-of-fact tone as he did all those years before,\n\"I can't tell you, you're not a monk.\"\n\"Thats what I feared your answer would be. Please then, let me become a monk so I can learn and get this sound from my head.\"\nThe abbot takes a long look, dripping with both hunger and pity and after a handful of breathes agrees.\"\n\nThe training is arduous and lengthy. The salesman is not a young man anymore and the demands, moth mental and physical task him to the core of his very being. He sleeps on stone, reads nothing but the texts of the obscure religious sect he wishes to join and eats nothing but gruel and through every minute, every blister, every headache, every pang of hunger the sound is there.\nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...\n\nFinally after several years worth of trails the man finally is ready to be inducted. The moment after the ceremony inducting him is complete he bolts to the chambers of the abbot.\n\"There, I did it. I'm a member of the order. NOW TELL ME WHAT THAT NOISE IS.\"\n\"Are you sure you wish to know?\" the abbot grimaces, \"It will change the way you think of not just the order, or me, but everything.\"\n\"Yes!\" the man cries \"I've never been more sure of anything in my life!\"\n\"Very well\" replied the abbot. And with that the sound in the mans head lessened, as if the promise curiosity being fed was able to sate the beast, even if for a moment. But still, even though quieter it was still present.\nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...\n\nThe abbot pulls a seemingly random book off the shelf behind him, and opens it. He reveals it to be hollow and pulls a monstrous set of keys from it and tucks them into his sleeve. He then pulls another book from the shelf and the shelf splits in half and opens like the doors in a supermarket with the sound of the grinding of ancient stone. Where the shelves used to be there is a door made of iron. The abbot pulls the set of keys out with an iron key extended, opens the door and swings it aside. As the man follows the abbot into the path behind the door he notices the sound getting louder.\nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...\n\nThey walk along a dark and musty path, the air like a forgotten wine cellar or crypt with the abbot wordlessly staring forward with grim purpose. He reaches the next door, a door made of polished bronze, reflecting as perfectly as a mirror. He pulls out a bronze key from the keyring in his sleeve and opens the door. Sure enough as the man passes though, a little louder this time\nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...\n\nAfter the bronze door came a staircase, down and down and down it went, until it seemed that they were descending into hell itself. Winding stairs, spiral stairs, branching stairs leading to nowhere and yet the two marched on, reaching a silver door. The abbot pulled out a silver key and as before set the door aside, making the sound ever louder.\nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...\n\nAnd then, it was time to climb. Yet the abbot, a man of innumerable years climbed as surefooted as a goat while the salesman followed behind, exhausted but determined not to give up now. At the apex of the climb, a door of gold was before them. The abbot then pulled a gold key, and in the grim routine as before, the door fell aside and the sound became ever louder. It seemed to be right next to them, a tangible force. A third person on this bizarre trek.\nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...\n\nAfter the golden door came a maze. Dizzying and seemingly endless, the abbot had no hesitation in his step and never second guessed himself. Hours passed in the maze as hours had passed in all the paths before and yet without ever turning around the abbot and the salesman reached a platinum door. As you can guess, platinum key, door, noise.\nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...\nAs the man walked into the next door he hesitated for the first time on his trip. The walls themselves seemed to be alive, screaming things in alien tongues as if the brick and mortar where being tortured. Grotesque faces in the masonry screamed as if every injustice upon earth was being visited upon them and yet somehow they could not drown out that sound, pounding louder than it ever had.\nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...\n\nAfter the hours that seemed of days in the pathway that screamed ceaselessly they reached a door, red and pulsing, as if made of some sort of flesh. The abbot pulled out a bony, fleshy....something from his keyring and inserted it into the door. All at once the walls stopped screaming, the flesh melted into nothing on the floor and the sound grew terrible and great. Louder and unchanged.\nthump thump...thump thump...thump thump...\n\nBehind the former wall of flesh was not another passage but a box. Wooden small and humble. The abbot pulled out one final key of wood and unlocked and opened the box. As he pulled the box open the sound became deafeningly loud and the man finally looked inside and gave a horrified scream.\nAnd I'd love to tell you what was inside, but you're not a monk.",

He made me promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned and went to answer the call.\n\nThe beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my boyfriend was out the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go.

Then, shifting to the other leg, I let three more go. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable!\n\nEventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my boyfriend returned as he apologized for taking so long. He asked me if I had peeked through the blindfold, and I assured him I had not.

Immediately, he started making statements similar to the silliness I had just said, and after composing myself from being doubled over in laughter, I later joined in. The following are some of the jokes we came up with, and now we're trying to figure out the formula (note: these are to be read in a dry humor/Stephen Wright style)\n\nI've never had to do laundry\n\nWhy's that?\n\nBecause every time I have dirty clothes, I just wash them\n\n-------------------------------\nI've never run out of gas before\n\nWhy's that?\n\nBecause every time I run out of gas, I just fill'er up\n\n--------------------------------\nI've never had to get the mail\n\nWhy's that?\n\nBecause every time I have mail, the postman delivers it\n\n---------------------------------\nI've never had cake this good before\n\nWhy's that?\n\nBecause every time I do, I eat it\n\n---------------------------------\nI've never had to cool off before\n\nWhy's that?\n\nBecause every time I'm hot, I just turn on the fan\n\nCan you figure it out? We've already concluded that one of the components seems to be mockery of the listener's stupidity in expecting a contradictory response. Sometimes there's double-meaning, but overall, it seems to work best with the speaker talking about having never taken some sort of action, especially in tasks that are considered run of the mill. All other nuances for how the joke works is lost on us at the moment. Help us figure it out, redditors. :)",

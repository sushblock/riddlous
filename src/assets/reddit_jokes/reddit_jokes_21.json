He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?\nThe monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a very strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\n\n\n\nThe man is disappointed  but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks again accept him, feed him, and again fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\n\nThe man says, All right, all right. I'm dying to know. \n\n\nIf the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?\n\n\nThe monks reply, You must travel the earth  and tell us how many blades of grass  there are and the exact number of sand pebbles, when you find these numbers, you will become a monk. The man sets about his task. Some 54 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.\n\n\nHe says, I have traveled the earth  and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.\n\n\nThe monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.\n\nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door  where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door. The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked.\n\n\nHe says, Real funny. May I have the key? The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door  made of stone.\n\nThe man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key  from the monks, who provide it.\n\nBehind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire, And so it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.\n\nFinally, the monks say, This is the last key  to the last door.\n\nThe man is relieved to know that he has finally reached to the end  .\n\nHe unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed  to find the source of that strange sound.\n\nBut he can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.\n\nEDIT: I feel everyones pain who read this, I went through the same feeling when I read it first time.",

So he went to the maid's room.  When he looked through the maid's room keyhole, he saw his dad having sex with his maid.  Little Johnny was surprised, but then he just realized something and thinks aloud,  \"OH!! Now I understand the government!

The woman becomes so angry that she takes her husband's pocket knife, cuts off his dick, and throws it out the window. The bloodied phallus flies backwards and hits the windshield, mortifying the father. His daughter asks, \"Daddy, what was that?\" The father, not wanting to expose his child to such a mortifying reality, says, \"Oh, it was just a fly sweetheart.\" The daughter looks off for a minute and then pipes up:\n\"That fly had a pretty big dick, didn't he?\"\nAdd on: when they return home, the stressed out man tells his wife of the night's events. She offers to have sex with him to help him loosen up and heads to the bathroom to freshen up. The now- naked man is sitting on the edge of the bed, putting a condom on, when his young son of 4 years old walks in. The dad promptly dives under the bed in an attempt to hide his naked shame. The son asks, \"Dad, what are you doing under the bed?\" The dad answers, \"Errrr...ummm...I'm looking for...a mouse! Yeah, a mouse!\" And then the son answers, \"What are you gonna do, fuck him?\"",

They were too preoccupied with the two big-time poets in the neighboring castle. The poets called themselves ShakespeareA and ShakespeareB. Their work was terrible, but the common folk were so enticed with the original work of the real Shakespeare that the brand name just kept rolling. The two Shakes were so conceited that they even believed that they were actually Shakespeares, and built two identical Globes that they lived in. Dmitri was tired of their fookin shite. So he took a trip to the local assassin, a shady man who had a sweet tooth for bakery treats. The assassin was so corrupt that he'd kill a man for just a single scone. Dmitri hit it off with the assassin instantly, and they struck an emotional connection that still stands today. Dmitri's poetry about cake plucked at the assassins heart strings, so he offered to lower his price to half a scone per man killed. Dmitri smiled and agreed, and before you could say \"iambic pentameter\" the two Shakes were found mysteriously dead, a silver arrow embedded in each of their necks. After this, the common folk began to listen to Dmitri's poetry. They loved it! Dmitri enjoyed immense wealth, and he and the assassin lived in high luxury. One day a man went up to Dmitri, and asked how Shakespeare A and Shakespeare B had overshadowed him for so long. Dmitri simply answered, \"What can I say, *I killed two Bards with one scone!\"*",

Tell me, did you get the child you were after.\"\n\nTo which Patty grabbed the priest by the collar, looked him in the eye and said, \"Blow that shit out already, we got feckin fourteen!\"\n",

You sent us to our deaths! We followed your instructions, but there was no bacon tree. Just hundreds of Indians, who killed everyone.\"\n\nThe old Rabbi holds up his hand and says \"Oy, vait a minute.\" He then gets out an English-Yiddish dictionary, and begins thumbing through it. \"Gevalt, I made myself ah big mistake.

You only have to get on one knee to greet the queen.\n\nBill and Hillary are now married 40 years. When they first got married, Bill said, \"I am putting a box under the bed. You must promise never to look in it.\" In all their 40 years of marriage, Hillary never looked. However, on the afternoon of their 40th anniversary, curiosity got the best of her, and she lifted the lid and peeked inside. In the box were 3 empty beer cans and $1,874.25 in cash. She closed the box and put it back under the bed. Now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why.\nThat evening they were out for a special dinner.

Whenever I was unfaithful to you I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again.\"\nHillary was shocked, but said, \"I am very disappointed and saddened, but I guess after all those years away from home on the road, temptation does happen and I guess that a few times is not that bad considering the years.\"\nThey hugged and made their peace.

She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.\n\nThe next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her \"womanly\" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.\n\nBut the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.\n\nAnyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.\n",

I don't know if you remember that, but it was all over the news at the time. Well the life raft that my grandpa was in also turned out to be slowly leaking. So he helped all of the people that were in his life raft onto another one, but he wouldn't get on himself because it was already so overloaded. So, my grandpa, and I'm not making this up. This was in the news. My grandpa, at 84 years old, swims for over a mile in the Atlantic Ocean to the coast of Portugal.\n\nWater-logged and exhausted, he hitches a ride and gets dropped off about 100 miles outside his destination in Germany. Trying to cross a main highway, he gets clipped by the side mirror of a car, but not badly, and he manages to hitch another ride with some people headed for Germany.\n\nEventually he catches a bus and arrives in this little town in Germany that he remembered from his youth. He's thrilled to find the old restaurant that he'd loved so much 60 years ago, and he walks in and takes his usual seat at the table by the window. The waitress comes over and my grandpa says, (my grandpa spoke German fluently, by the way), he says, \"I know exactly what I want. You have no idea what I've had to go through to get here. I would love a nice big slice of your wonderful Bavarian cream pie.\"\n\nThe waitress says, \"Sorry, Sir - but we're all out of Bavarian cream.\"\n\nMy grandpa says, \"Apple's fine.\"\n",

My morning breath is so bad, I'm afraid that my fiancee will not want to sleep in the same room with me.\"\n\nHer mother said simply, \"Try this. In the morning, get straight out of bed and head for the kitchen to make breakfast. While the family is busy eating, move on to the bathroom and brush your teeth. The key is, not to say a word until you've brushed your teeth.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't say good morning or anything?\" the daughter asked.\n\n\"Not a word,\" her mother affirmed.\n\n\"Well, it's certainly worth a try,\" she thought.\n\nThe loving couple were finally married. Not forgetting the advice each had received, he with his perpetual socks and she with her morning silence, they managed quite well. That is, until about six months later.\n\nShortly before dawn one morning, the husband wakes with a start to find that one of his socks had come off. Fearful of the consequences, he frantically searches the bed. This, of course, wakes his bride and without thinking, she asks, \"What on earth are you doing?\"\n\n\"Oh, my,\" he replies, \"you've swallowed my sock!\"",

It only costs $10.\" Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: \"You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be better in two weeks.\"\nLater that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message:\n\"Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic. Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer.

When he gets into the exam room the doctor says: Hello moth, what can I do for you?\"\n\nThe moth replies: \"Well doc, I'm incredibly depressed. I'm feel like my life is falling away from underneath me. I've work at the book bindery for Peter Ilynovich for 25 years. Not once in my career have I had a raise. I'm not even sure he knows my name. I have absolutely no passion for my job. I don't have any passion in my life at all for that matter. I lie awake at night, deeply troubled. When I turn to my sleeping wife, I do not even recognize her. She has not aged well. Where is the beautiful moth I married? My mind then turns to my daughter, Anastasia. She died in the great war. She was the only joy in my life, and now she is just a distant memory.\"\n\nHe begins to weep.\n\nI then think of my other child. I think of my son, Gregaro, and how I cannot look him in the eye, for if I do , I see the same cowardice that I see every time I look in the mirror at my pathetic reflection. I see the same cowardice that keeps me from taking the loaded pistol on my bedside table, cocking it, placing it against my temple, and pulling the trigger.\"\n\nThe moth becomes even more morose. He continues:\n.\n\"I feel like a spider... even though I am a moth... hanging from a single thread above an eternal inferno, burning white hot with shame and regret. I believe the only way out of this miserable existence is to take my own life.\"\n\nThe podiatsist takes along hard look at the moth in silenc. After a moment he says:\n\n\"I am very sorry you are so deeply troubled, moth. But you need to see a Psychiatrist. Why on earth did you come to see me?\"\n\nThe moth looks at the podiatrist and says:\n\"Well, the light was on.\"",

The didn't stay in five star hotels or travel by private jet - they stayed with normal families on their campaigns and in exchange for a place to stay, would do chores around the property before they headed to a new city. \n\nIn 1860 Abraham Lincoln actually stayed with my great great great grandma. She was a pretty bossy lady and gave Lincoln a long list of chores to do as soon as she met him. Finally when he thought he was done, my grandma said \"Last chores Abraham. For dinner we're having stew, corn on the cob, and apple pie. I'll work on the stew, but you're going to be on the front porch shucking corn and peeling apples until there's nothing left in front of you.\" And with that, she led him outside where there were two huge baskets filled to the brim with apples and corn. \n\nAbraham started peeling and shucking. Periodically my grandma would check on him to see how much he had left to get an idea of when they'd eat. Little known fact about Abraham Lincoln, but he is very bad at shucking corn and peeling apples. \n\nAfter checking on him for what felt like the tenth time, my grandma was real frustrated. She said \"Abraham, how the hell can you be expected to lead a country if you can't even help with dinner!?\" \n\nAnd Abraham Lincoln replied, \"relax Mrs. Lee, I have four cores and seven ears to go.\"\n\n\n\nMy dad CLAIMS he invented this. He has lots of others like it with similar punchlines where he rewords common sayings - 'brass is always cleaner on the other slide,' etc. \n\n\nEdit: I'll post another of his originals. It'll take a bit to type up, but it'll be posted soon!",

The first guy suggests his buddy go first, he agrees, bends over and closes his eyes. The first guy gets a lamp and sticks it bulb-first in his buddies ass. WOAH, says the second guy...that's a lamp. Correct, my turn says the first guy, who bends over and closes his eyes. The second guy shoves a broom-handle in the first guys ass. DAMN, says the first guy, that's a broom-handle. Correct says the second guy who exclaims, \"my turn!\" He bends over and closes his eyes.\n\n\n**important part**\n\n\nThe first guy proceeds to ream his buddy with...uh...with uh...\n\n\n**the joke teller should make up and down motions (like unclogging a toilet) and mumble about a \"toilet thingy\"**\n\n\nIf you've done this correctly, your sucker should correct you and say, \"toilet plunger\" to which you reply.\n\n\n**punchline**\n\n\n\"Ah, I see you've played this game before.\"\n\n\nEnjoy your newfound popularity as your sucker gets red-faced and tries to talk their way out of it.\n\n\n**disclaimer**\n\n\nI mean no offense to anyone, it's a joke.",

Despite all this travel, he, of course, never drives. He always has a different chauffeur to take him wherever he is going who always meet him at the airport and take him wherever he wants to go. The Pope misses driving, so one day he asks his driver, \"Do you mind if I drive, just this once? I haven't driven ever since becoming pope.\"\n\nNow, the chauffeur was a very pious man and didn't want to offend the Pope, but doesn't want to get in trouble with his boss. Eventually he decides that that it was a quick drive and that no one would know, so he agrees. \n\nThey both get in the car with the Pope in the driver's seat, but as soon as the car got out of the parking lot, the Pope started speeding, cutting people off, running red lights and stop signs, just driving terribly in general. The chauffeur is panicking. He would lose his job, surely. And yet, he doesn't say a thing, being too afraid to offend the Pope. \n\nSure enough, they get pulled over. As the cop walks up to the car, the chauffeur nearly faints. However, he takes one look in the window and turns right around and phones base. \n\n\"Sir, I've got a problem here. I've just pulled someone ever that is very important. I don't think I can book him.\"\n\nThe chief responds, \"Too important? Impossible.

The instructor laughed then yelled at him, and at last convinced the soldier to switch parachutes.\n\nThe soldier jumped and was relieved when his parachute opened. Moments later, he saw the instructor darting to the ground, hopelessly trying to open the parachute, and yelled at the soldier: \u201cI\u2019LL RAPE YOUR MOTHER IN HEEEEEEELL\u201d.",

I came downstairs and I decided to have a banana for breakfast, just a banana, keeping it simple. And I was looking at this banana lying there in front of me when some rage started to come over me. I started laying into the banana - verbally not physically, I\u2019m not aggressive in that way, I always talk before I hit - and I really tore it off a strip, articulate, you know, calling it shorty and ugly and things like that. Incidentally, something you should know about bananas is that they are very placid, either that or they have long memories. Anyway after five minutes I felt I\u2019d said enough and before it could think of a come-back I ate it in two gulps. \nSo feeling pleased with myself and in a funny way virile, I packed my good tie and went off to work. After lunch my boss comes up to me and totally lays into me, telling me my work output is well below par and that he thinks I\u2019m short and ugly, the latter of which I personally felt was unreasonable. Now, before you ask how the court case is going let me tell you that kind of negativity and put-down was not unusual. Me and my boss we had issues, along the lines of Putin and Poroshenko, and I figured today he was just ball-aching about some lost investors. Also, you know, I have background information on him. Nevertheless I was smarting by the end of the day. \nThe next morning I woke up with the same feelings of malice and I start to think that maybe I\u2019m just not a morning person. Again the banana gets it, both barrels and I\u2019m calling out, \u2018Anybody in there? Eh? Come on out!\u2019 And again just after lunch I get it from my boss, both barrels, almost word for word. This went on two weeks. \nFinally I figured: voodoo, you know, that I was caught up in some weird gris-gris and that I was experiencing everything the banana did, right up until I ate it. So, the next day I was deliberately nice to the banana, calling it sweet, funny and smart and most of all purposeful and I thought by doing this maybe I\u2019d get back the same sorts of compliments and in the long run my life would be immeasurably enriched. I get into work and all is good, everything\u2019s going real well and I think I\u2019ve nailed it right up until after lunch when my boss gives me another torrent of abuse and punches me in the mouth. There and then I handed in my notice and now the joke is on him because I won for constructive dismissal.",

I do have one bike I can sell you. The only catch is there are some exposed wires. It runs fine. Just make sure you rub some vaseline on the wires when it rains.\" The man buys the bike. He is elated.\nThat night, he goes to his girlfriend's parents' house for dinner. Before they make the door, she tells him to remember one thing: \"Don't talk at the dinner table. The first person to talk at the dinner table has to do the dishes.\"\n\"That's no problem,\" the man says. \"I'm happy to do the dishes.\" His girlfriend shoots him a foreboding look.\nWhen they walk into the house, the man is greeted with a pungent, formidable scent. It is then that he notices that the house is lined floor-to-ceiling with moldy, disgusting, months-old dishes.\nHe decides that something must be done.\nTen minutes into dinner, the man puts down his silverware. He proceeds to grab his girlfriend, throw her onto the table, tear off all her clothes, and ruthlessly pipe her out in front of both her parents. Once he is done, he glances at his girlfriend's father. Dad is clearly infuriated but says nothing. The meal continues.\nAnother ten minutes pass and the man grabs his girlfriend's mother and repeats the task. Gives it to her in the strictest of biblical senses.\nAgain, he looks at dad. Dad is beet red, seemingly read to pulverize the man. But he says nothing.\nThey continue to eat. Suddenly, a great burst of thunder peals out and it begins to rain torrentially.\n\"Oh, shit, I need some Vaseline!\" the man exclaims.\nDad recoils and raises his hands.\n\"That's OK. I'll do the dishes.\"",

He had tractor wallpaper, a tractor bed, tractor sheets, tractor pillowcases, not to mention all of the tractor toys he would lovingly play with every day. \n\nOn Timmy's 13th birthday his parents decided to take him to a farm and let him ride on a tractor. Timmy was excited that his dream of riding on a tractor was finally becoming reality. After about 30 minutes of being driven around, the farmer offered Timmy a quick go behind the wheel. Timmy was thrilled, nothing could make him happier. As Timmy drove around the field he started to become more and more confident, when suddenly, disaster struck. Timmy, now not really concentrating on where he was going, hit a bump in the field and the tractor lost control and hit a tree. The farmer managed to escape but Timmy was caught between the tractor and the tree and passed out from the pain. \n\nTimmy awoke a week later in his local hospital; both of his parents were so relieved that he was awake they almost crushed him again. Unfortunately both of Timmy's legs were broken as well as his lower back. It took Timmy 2 and a half years to finally be back in control over his body and after months or grueling physiotherapy he was finally able to get back home. When he walked into his tractor covered room he almost broke down in tears. Timmy hated Tractors. Timmy never wanted to see another tractor again and so the next day his walls were stripped, his bedding changed and his toys put away and Timmy tried to move on with his life. \n\nThroughout his life growing up Timmy started to put the whole tractor incedent behind him and focus on his new goals in life such as a job or house or even a girlfriend but he never got rid of that hatred of all things tractor. \n\nWe now see Timmy in his mid 20's life's been good to him. He has a good job and has just moved into a new flat in a nice part of town. He pops into a bar on his way home from work for a quick drink. The bar was thick with smoke and Timmy could barley see in front of him. As he went up to the bar he noticed the most beautiful lady he had ever seen in his life. She had long golden hair that fell gracefully from her head. Her eyes were a deep green and her lips a dark red. As Timmy was thinking of something to say to her he noticed a single tear running down her cheek. \"Beautiful lady why are you crying\" Timmy asked. She looked up at him and explained that all the smoke was hurting her eyes and she was struggling to breath. Timmy new it was his time to shine. \"Never fear\" he said and stood up on the bar. He then took a deep breath and sucked in all the smoke from the bar; everyone was now staring at him as he casualy walked outside and exhaled all the smoke into the atmosphere. As he walked back in he heard the woman cry \"how on earth did you do that?!\" \"It's easy,\" Timmy replied \"I'm an ex tractor fan.\"",

There is no need to put a piece of lemon on the edge of the chalice.\n2. The cupboard beside the altar is a confessional and not the toilet.\n3.

Judas is not called son of a bitch.\n9. The Pope can't be called El Padrino.\n10. Osama Bin Laden had nothing to do with Jesus' crucifixion.\n11.

Among other services that it could not afford to continue to provide was the operation of several large laughing academies.\n\nThe chief psychiatrists for the various institutes of mental health met in conference with the new president and, after much anguished consideration, it was decided in the interests of public safety that the incurable inmates could not simply be turned out onto the streets.  Instead, it was decided that they would be put onto a large isolated jungle island in the river to fend for themselves.\n\nThis volcanic island had been a long-term wildlife preserve for the nation's endangered species.  On the island lived various rare species of monkeys and parrots and one example of a particularly rare species of sloth.\n\nWhen the day arrived for the new colony of former mental health patients to be established, they were ferried in small groups to the island.  As they came ashore, the new arrivals began exploring the island.  They soon discovered the magnificent rare sloth in a huge tree, suspended from his favorite limb above the steaming water of a volcanic pool.\n\nAs more and more of the new colonists arrived, they flocked to the tree to stare and gibber in fascination at the sloth.  The sloth, therefore, became as agitated as a sloth could get and crept further out along his tree limb.  As the crowd grew, the sloth crept out further and further until the limb finally snapped and he fell to his death into the bubbling water of the steaming pool below.\n\nThis is, of course, but another proof that too many kooks boil the sloth.\n",

If you go out and work for a year, I\u2019ll upgrade you to a Honey Nut Cheerio.\u201d The Cheerio thinks on it, and quickly agrees. He goes out, works as hard as he can for a year, and comes back to his boss very satisfied with his work. His boss happily upgrades him to a Honey Nut Cheerio, but upon tasting himself, the Cheerio thinks he still has a lot of room for improvement.\n\n-\n\nThe Cheerio says \u201cBoss, I appreciate what you\u2019ve done for me, and not to look a gift horse in the mouth, but I think I could still be tastier.\u201d The boss smiles widely, and claps his hands together. \u201cI like your attitude, young man. I tell you what, if you go out and work for two more years, I\u2019ll upgrade you to an Apple Jack.\u201d The Cheerio happily agrees, and speeds out of his boss\u2019s office to get to work. He works hard for two more years, and makes the trip back into his boss\u2019s office. Again, upon receiving the promotion, the Cheerio tastes himself and still thinks he can be better.\n\n-\n\n\u201cBoss,\u201d he says, \u201cI really can\u2019t thank you enough, but I still think I can taste better.\u201d The boss furrows his brow and looks deep into the Cheerio\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re a real go-getter, boy. If you go out and work for three years, I\u2019ll upgrade you to a Captain Crunch Crunch Berry.\u201d The Cheerio nods his head, and storms out to get back to work. He works hard, harder than he ever has, for those three years, and comes back to his boss for the promotion. He tastes himself again, and is still unimpressed.\n\n-\n\n\u201cBefore you say anything,\u201d the Boss interjects, \u201cI\u2019ll assume you\u2019re still not satisfied. I want to extend the opportunity to upgrade to a Lucky Charms Marshmallow, but only if you go out and work for four more years.\u201d The Cheerio goes home, thinks about his boss\u2019s proposal, and comes back the next day ready to accept. He goes and works diligently for four years, and when he comes back he can definitely taste the difference. The strolls into his boss\u2019s office proudly and sits down. \u201cBoss, I taste amazing. I mean seriously, I might be the tastiest cereal ever. Thank you.\u201d \n\n-\n\nThe boss laughs. \u201cNot quite, son. If you want, you can go out to work for five years and become a Cinnamon Toast Crunch. But if you do, you\u2019ll never be able to become a Reese\u2019s Puff.\u201d The Cheerio wracks his brain for a decision taking weeks to weigh the two options, and eventually concludes that no matter what he has to give up, he wants to become a Cinnamon Toast Crunch. He goes out and dedicates five years of his life to becoming a Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and when he comes back into his boss\u2019s office, he is almost unbearably delicious.\n\n-\n\n\u201cBoss, I\u2019ve hit the pinnacle of tastiness. I doubt that in all my years of life, I\u2019ve ever tasted anything so good, and doubt I\u2019ll ever taste anything better.\u201d The boss slowly shakes his head, smiling. \u201cListen. Only one cereal on Earth has done what I\u2019m about to suggest, but I think you have the chops to make it a reality. If you go out and work for ten years, I can almost guarantee you to become a Honeycomb.\u201d Picking his jaw up off the ground, the Cheerio happily and eagerly accepts. He goes out and works. For ten years, sleeping very little, eating even less, ignoring friends, family, and any other obligation, he does nothing but work for ten long years, and the Cheerio staggers back into his boss\u2019s office successful. His boss upgrades him to a Honeycomb, and those ten years of hard labor instantly becomes more than worth it. \n\n-\n\nHis boss is floored. \u201cSon, I had my doubts about you, but now there\u2019s nothing more I can give you. Well done.\u201d The Cheerio, feeling like the tastiest thing in the universe, proudly leaves his boss\u2019s office and goes into the open world. However, working for twenty-five years made the Cheerio incredibly thirsty, so he makes the trip to the most popular store in town, the milk store. The line stretches out of the door and around the corner, so the Cheerio decides to drink something else. He goes to the water store, and though the line is definitely shorter, there\u2019s still a hundred people waiting in front of him. He figures he could probably go somewhere else before the line clears, so he decides to go to the punch store. One he arrives, he remembers that he hates punch, but he isn\u2019t going to go anywhere else because there\u2019s no punch line.",

By sheer force of will he dragged himself from his bed and out to the outhouse to do some paperwork. However, being as tired as he was, he fell asleep on the pot. \n\nThe next morning his friends awoke early and noticed him missing. They searched the camp-sight and finally found him snoring on the toiled. They decided to prank their hapless friend by putting the Deer guts down the outhouse, the idea being to make several jokes on the way home about how he had taken such a colossal shit over the night that he pooped his guts out. That done they headed back to the cabin and waited.\n\n15 minutes later they hear their friend runs into the cabin and says \"You guys will never believe it, Last night, I was so tired that I fell asleep on the can and pooped my guts out.

The middle aged, male bus driver says \"Hey I saw what just happened. Don't beat yourself up over it, she takes this bus everyday, this happens to every guy who tries to talk to her. The guy says \"I wonder why?\" The bus driver responds \"Well, I know for a fact that she's super religious so that might have something to do with it. I also know that she goes to the cemetery every Tuesday night to pray to God. Some people have seen her there and heard her saying things like she wishes to be the mother of the next Christ.\" The man says \"That seems a bit odd.\" The bus driver replies \"True, but think about it, you could use this situation to your advantage. If you go to the cemetery dressed as the lord, you'll probably get lucky.\" The man excitedly replies \"Yeah you're right, thanks!\" So when Tuesday night came around the guy dressed like Jesus, but with a hood on to hide his identity and went to the cemetery. Just as the bus driver said, he saw the woman dressed as a nun praying in front of a statue of Jesus. He hears her speak \"Please Lord, please, my only wish is to be the mother of the second coming of your son.\" The guy takes advantage of the situation and responds to her. \"I have heard your prayers and have come to fulfill your wish.  Excitedly she says \"Oh thank you Lord! You have no idea how happy this makes me, but before we get started, I request that we have anal sex first.\" The man, super happy about this agrees. He lifts up the gown and starts to have anal sex with her. \n\nAs he finishes, he removes his hood and says \"Ha! I'm the guy from the bus.\" They remove their hood, \"Ha! I'm the bus driver!\"",

His dad thought for a while and answered, \"Look at it this way: I'm the president, your mom is Congress, your maid is the work force, you are the people and your baby brother is the future.\" \"I still don't get it\" responded the Little Johnny. \"Why don't you sleep on it then? Maybe you'll understand it better,\" said the dad. \"Okay then...good night\" said Little Jonny went off to bed.  In the middleof the night, Little Johnny was awakened by his baby brother's crying.  He went to his baby brother's crib and found that his baby brother had taken a crap in his diaper.  So Little Johnny went to his parent's room to get help.  When he got to his parent's bedroom, he looked through the keyhole to check if his parents were asleep.  Through the keyhole he saw his mom loudly snoring, buthis dad wasn't there.  So he went to the maid's room.  When he looked through the maid's room keyhole, he saw his dad having sex with his maid.  Little Johnny was surprised, but then he just realized somethingand thinks aloud,  \"OH!! Now I understand the government! The President is screwing the work force, Congress is fast asleep, nobody cares about the people, andthe future is full of shit!\"",

But as Tim grew up he realized that was not his passion but the pressure from his family to follow in his fathers footsteps was too great, so after Tim graduated high school he enrolled in training in hopes to be hired at a train station. After a few years of going through this training school and failing many attempts, Tim finally passed and got his credentials. He was hired right off the bat at a successful train station as a train conductor. Of course since Tim was so bad at his job he did not do very well. The first train he is on crashes and kills 19 people due to his incompetence. He was fired and charges were brought up against him. Tim, living in like Russia or somewhere, was sentenced to death the next day. But before they kill him, they asked what he wanted from his last meal. Since Tim obviously did not want to die this way he thought of a clever way to stall his execution by asking for an outrageous last meal. He asked for a specific ancient chinese rice recipe only obtainable from a vendor in China, sacred beef from a cow in India, and a blue apple from Nigeria. The Russian government, although upset about it, jumped on this list as fast as they could because they really wanted to execute this guy that killed 19 people! So the Russian diplomats went off to China and found a very old Chinese man and asked for his family\u2019s ancient chinese rice recipe, and of course the Chinese man would never give it up to these foreigners and he was even offended by their asking for it and felt it would bring shame to his family. The Russian diplomats offered the Chinese man $5,000 and he immediately accepted the offer. Then the Russian diplomats went off to India to grab some sacred beef from a cow. The Hindus are disgusted that they want to kill one of their sacred cows to give to a criminal and they want to imprison the Russian trespassers, but then the Russians offered them $5,000 as well, and they accepted it immediately too. Now finally the Russians are off to Nigeria for the blue apple and the same deal happens. The Russians want Tim dead so bad that they offered the same deal to the Nigerians, $5000 for the blue apple. They accept and now the Russians are off back to the prison to kill Tim, he eats his last meal as slow as he could and when he finished they hooked up to the chair. They pull the lever and shock him, but Tim doesn\u2019t die. The Russians are confused and they believe its an act of God so they release him. Now that Tim is out of prison he needs to get a job and since he really only knows how to be in one line of work, he goes back to get a job at another train station and a train conductor. Tim is a creature of repetition and so on his first train, it crashes again and killed 36 people this time due to his mistakes. The Russian government seriously wants this guy dead so they put him back onto death row and ask him what he wanted to his 2nd last meal. Tim still didn\u2019t want to die so he asked for the same meal again! Although reluctant the Russian diplomats are off again and start by going to China and see the old man again, but to their surprise he wasn\u2019t there, and in his place was a significantly younger Chinese man. The Russians approach him and asked where was the old man. The rice vendor informs them that was his father that passed away after he sold them his rice and now he is in charge of his shop. The Russians ask him if they can have some of the rice for their prisoner and the young chinese man curses them out saying that they are the reason his father died and he would never give them his rice. The Russians offer him $10,000 and he accepted it without thought. Now onto the quest for beef. The Russians go back to India and asked the Monks to give them more beef. When asked, the Monks tell the Russians that they made the Gods very angry at them so this time they would have to do a sacred dancing ritual to honor and sacrifice the cow. After days of learning the dance and meditating the Russians leave with their beef and go on back to Nigeria. This time they did not want to offer any money to the Nigerians so the Russians simply stole the apple. They brought all the supplies back to the prison in Russia and gave them to Tim. He eats and enjoys then is put back into the chair. The Russians being afraid of another act from God shock him anyways and sure enough the shock to his head doesn\u2019t kill him so they release him. Now Tim is out and is unemployed because no one will hire this idiot, but his father was able to convince his boss to hire him as another train conductor. Of course his first train crashes again and killed 59 people! Tim is now used to being on death row tries to think of another last meal he can request to stall for even longer. He asked again for the rice and the beef, but instead of the blue apple, he wants a giant mango from Australia. The Russian Diplomats are off once more, but this time they aren\u2019t dealing with shit. They go to China and murdered the vendor and stole the rice. They go to India and murdered all the Monks and stole the cows. They go to Australia and shake down a giant mango that crushes and kills their outback guide. They hurry back to the prison shove the food down Tim\u2019s throat and strap him to the chair. The Russians highly doubt that the third time will go wrong. They pull the lever and nothing happens! They pull it twice! Three times! Nothing! They finally ask Tim, \u201cWHY WON\u2019T YOU DIE?!\u201d, Tim has a puzzled look on his face and responds, \u201cI do not know.. I guess I\u2019m just a bad conductor\u201d. ",

Without thinking, the kid jumps out of the Jeep, and runs up to the elephant. Turns out theres a large stick wedged in his paw. The young child pulls the stick out, and the elephant wraps him up in his trunk, lifts him waaaaaay up in the air, and lets out a big elephant roar, and puts him down.\n\nFast forward a few years, and the kid has grown up and has a family of his own, as kids tend to do. One day he decides to take his family to the zoo, and they see the polar bears, all pent up and sad looking. And they see the Tigers, looking terrifying as shit, and they finally come to the elephant enclosure. The father is pointing out the elephant tusks and whatnot, when he notices something, a familiar face if you will. without thinking about it, he jumps over the fence, and races up to this one full grown elephant. He stands face-to-face with the elephant, and touches his paw. The elephant wraps him up in his trunk, lifts him waaaaay up into the air, and lets out a mighty elephant roar... then tramples the guy to death. So I guess it wasn't the same elephant.",

The woman, being pregnant, can't get down that easy. One of the armed guys panics and thinks she is resisting, so he shoots her and hits her multiple times in her belly. Thankfully, the woman survives, and she gets rushed to the hospital. After everything seems fine, the doctors decide she should have her ultrasound. The doctor see's that she is gonna give birth to 3 children 2 girls and 1 boy, BUT, they all have been hit by a bullet. However, the doctor thinks that it'll be fine and at some point of their lives, the bullets will come out.\nSo, a few years later, one of the girls comes crying to her mother \"Mommy, I just peed and when I wanted to flush the toilet, there was a bullet in the water\" so her mom calms her down and explains the Bank robbery story. After this the girl is calmed down but still a bit worried. A few weeks later, the other girl comes running and crying to her mom. Before she can even speak, her mom says \"let me guess, you went to the toilet and found a bullet?\" \"yes mommy, how do you know?\" and to her, the mom too explains the armed robbery story. But then a few months later the boy comes crying to his mom, so before he can speak she says \"let me guess, you were doing some business in the toilet when there was a bullet inside of it?\" \"NO\" the boy replies, \"I was jerking off and all of the sudden I shot our dog\"\n\nEDIT: Changed echo to ultrasound",

The drunkard put his palms together like a prayer and raises it in the air while letting the palms separate.\n\nThe scholar looks at him confused not knowing what to do. After muttering \"Whaaaat? What?\" under his breath, he turns to everyone and says, I admit defeat. And slowly turn to walk away.\n\nThe villagers ran to the scholar saying, \"What happened? What happened? What did he say to you?\"\n\nThe scholar replied, \"I started by saying Unity\" and he said, \"Diversity\". Then I said, \"Power\". And he said, \"Absolute POWER\". Then I said, \"World Domniation. An.. and... I don't know. I don't know what he meant by that.\" Saddened and ashamed he walked away.\n\nAll the villagers now ran to the drunkard asking, \"What happened? You won. What did he say to you?\"\n\nThe drunkard says, \"I don't know man. This fucking queer comes to me and tell me that he wants to stick ONE finger up my ass. Hell no, I told him I'm gonna stick TWO fingers up his ass. He has the balls to tell me that he's gonna shove his FIST up my ass? I told him I'm gonna shove my whole FOREARM in his ass. He told me that my asshole is too small. I told him I'll make it BIG!\"\n\n-The End\n\nP.S: Its my first post guys. This joke is better delivered than read IMO. I hope ya'll enjoy.",

He then admitted that he was a virgin, and he wasn't really sure exactly what he was supposed to do.  The man asked him, \"What room are you staying in?\"  The groom replied, \"710.\"  \"Well, I'm staying right next door in 712!  I'll tell you what, if you have any problems tonight, you just holler real loud -- I should be able to hear through the wall -- and I'll tell you what to do!\"  The groom, feeling a bit more courageous, then returned to his room to find his wife already in the bed, giggling nervously.  He hurried into the bathroom to get a quick shower.  Suddenly, she had the urge to take a major shit.  She looked around and realized that she couldn't go into the bathroom while he was in there taking a shower!  What could she do?  She couldn't hold it any longer, so she took the shoe box that held her wedding shoes, threw the shoes across the room, and promptly relieved herself in the box.  As soon as she was done, she heard him getting ready to come out of the bathroom, so she quickly slid the box under the bed and turned out the light.  He came out of the bathroom a few seconds later and stumbled in the dark towards the bed.  He misjudged the distance and his foot went under the bed, right into the shoe box.

In it was a man.\n\nSo, he asked him for his ticket: \"Excuse me sir, do have your ticket?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am soooo sorry, I dropped it out the window by accident,\" he replied.\n\n\"Sorry sir, can't have any passengers without tickets.\" He grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and threw him out of the train. Well, he landed on the tracks and was run over by the train. Naturally, the conductor was arrested and thrown in jail. He was convicted of murder before a jury of his peers, and sentenced to death by electrocution.\n\nThe day of his execution came up, and he was asked what he would like for his last meal. He asks for a banana. They gave it to him, he ate it, received his last rites, and was escorted to the chair. The executioner strapped him in, hooked everything up. Last, he threw the big switch once, and nothing happened. So, he did it again, and nothing happened. Well, by law the guy was legally dead, so they had to release him.\n\nOddly enough, the guy got a job on another railroad, as a conductor! One day, he was gathering tickets, and came to a booth with a little boy.\n\n\"Young man, do you have your ticket?\", asked the conductor.\n\n\"A-a-a, I'm sorry, I ate it by mistake..\", said the little boy.\n\nAnd.. the same thing happened -- the boy was thrown off the train and killed. The guy was arrested, sentenced to death by electrocution. It came to him last day. The death row guard asked him what he would like for his meal. He asked for banana again. He ate it, and a priest gave him last rites.\n\nHe was escorted to the death chamber. This time, though, they were smart.\n\nThey washed his hands to get rid of any banana slime, they washed up the chair. Next, they placed him the chair, and hooked him up. The switch-puller pulled the switch once, and nothing happened. The switch-puller pulled the switch twice, and nothing happened, not even a single hair raising on the guy's chest.\n\nWell, as the law says, they had to let him go...\n\nEven more amazingly, he got a job on yet another railroad.\n\nThis time it was a rabbi. Same old stuff. Rabbi had no ticket (he forgot to buy it). Guy threw him off the train, rabbi died. Guy was arrested, convicted, sentenced to death by electrocution.\n\nWhen the guard asked him what he would like for a last meal, he asked for a banana. He ate it, received last rites, and was escorted to the chamber.\n\nHowever, this time the officials where going to get it right! They scrubbed his body with a brillo pad. They scrubbed the chair with steel wool. They tried the chair on a few other prisoners...\n\nOkay, they strapped him in, and threw the switch once, nothing happened. Threw the switch a second time, nothing happened. At this point the guy was legally dead, etc, etc.\n\nBut, before the guy could leave, the executioner, extremely frustrated (he'd seen this same guy three times already). asked, \"What is it with the banana!\"\n\nThe guy replied, \"I just like bananas.\"\n\nSo, the executioner screamed, \"THEN HOW COME YOU DON'T DIE!!!!!\"\n\n\"I dunno,\" replied the guy, \"I guess I'm just not a very good conductor.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n",

There, in the corner, there\u2019s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.\n\nSo the guy asks the bartender, \u201cWhere\u2019d he come from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThere\u2019s a genie in the men\u2019s room who grants wishes.\u201d\n\nSo the guy runs into the men\u2019s room and, sure enough, there\u2019s this genie. And the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d So the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cO.K., I wish for world peace.\u201d And there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and then the room fills up with geese.\n\nSo the guy walks out of the men\u2019s room and he\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nSo the guy processes this. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cDoes that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cYeah. Why, what did you wish for?\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWorld peace.\u201d\n\nSo the bartender is understandably ashamed.\n\nAnd the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it\u2019s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI feel like I should explain myself further.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nBut the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d",

In exchange for answers (he was super smart) I would hang out with him and be his friend and stuff. After I cheated off of him and studied with him though, I did get to be his friend and we got very close. His sister, Ling, was always uptight about school and she made sure to study, she got stressed about a B, etc. One day I was hanging out with Ving, and we started talking about names. He went off on this huge rant about how he hated his, and how he wanted to change it to something more Asian-American, like Lee. I told him that the Courthouse downtown had a form that you could fill to legally change it. He told me:\n\n\"I always give you answers. If you could just drive me down to the courthouse this one time, I will never forget you. I just hate this god-forsaken Chinese name and I want to get rid of it forever.\" He seemed pretty adamant about it, so I decided the best decision would be to take him. We walked out to my car, and right as I put the keys in the ignition Ling came running and tapped on the car door like a madman. I rolled it down and she started freaking out about how Ving's name had been passed down through generations and generations, but Ving didn't care. He just wanted to go down to the Courthouse and get it over with. Ling figured that coming with would be the best idea, so if anything else came up that she would be needed for, she would be there for Ving. Honestly, I felt stuck in the middle of a family feud, so I just took her along.\n\nWhen we got to the Courthouse, Ving confidently walked up to the front desk and asked the receptionist if he could change his name. She gave him a little packet of paper and told him to sit down. Ling and I waited patiently while Ving filled out his info. I was watching him fill it out and I noticed he really did want to change his name to Lee. Before he finished, though, he started tearing up. He told me he couldn't change his name. He asked the lady at the front that he couldn't do it, and she told him he would need twenty dollars to cancel the request. Ling was so relieved and happy that he changed his mind, she dug through her purse, found the money, and started to hand it to the receptionist.\n\nIt was at this moment that the most stereotypical Asian man burst through the doors. He was wearing a Hawaiian shirt, a visor, American flag shorts, flip flops, everything. This little guy was decked out.\n\nWhen Ving and his old man saw each other, they both started bawling, and embraced each other. Out of his tears, Ving said\n\n\"Dad, I love my name. I want to be Ving forever, and I'm going to name my kids Ving, and they're going to name their kids Ving, and-\"\n\nAnd the old man said \"Dont, stop. Be Lee, Ving! Hold onto that fee, Ling.\"",

        "body": " a guy walks into a bar one day and he can\u2019t believe his eyes. There, in the corner, there\u2019s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.\n\nSo the guy asks the bartender, \u201cWhere\u2019d he come from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThere\u2019s a genie in the men\u2019s room who grants wishes.\u201d\n\nSo the guy runs into the men\u2019s room and, sure enough, there\u2019s this genie. And the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d So the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cO.K., I wish for world peace.\u201d And there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and then the room fills up with geese.\n\nSo the guy walks out of the men\u2019s room and he\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nSo the guy processes this. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cDoes that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cYeah. Why, what did you wish for?\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWorld peace.\u201d\n\nSo the bartender is understandably ashamed.\n\nAnd the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it\u2019s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI feel like I should explain myself further.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nBut the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.\n\nSo the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nAnd then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s just grab a beer. It\u2019s on me.\u201d \n\nby Simon Rich (The New Yorker)",

While in China, he is very sexually promiscuous and does not use a condom all the time.\n\nA week after arriving back home in the States, he awakes one morning to find his penis covered with bright green and purple spots. Horrified, he immediately goes to see a doctor. The doctor, never having seen anything like this before, orders some tests and tells the man to return in two days for the results.\n\nThe man returns a couple of days later and the doctor says: \u201cI\u2019ve got bad news for you. You\u2019ve contracted Mongolian VD. It\u2019s very rare and almost unheard of here. We know very little about it.\u201d\n\nThe man looks a little perplexed and says: \u201cWell, give me a shot or something and fix me up, doc.\u201d\n\nThe doctor answers: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, there\u2019s no known cure. We\u2019re going to have to amputate your penis.\u201d\n\nThe man screams in horror, \u201cAbsolutely not! I want a second opinion!\u201d\n\nThe doctor replies: \u201cWell, it\u2019s your choice. Go ahead if you want, but surgery is your only choice.\u201d\n\nThe next day, the man seeks out a Chinese doctor, figuring that he\u2019ll know more about the disease.\n\nThe Chinese doctor examines his penis and proclaims: \u201cAh, yes, Mongolian VD. Velly lare disease.\u201d\n\nThe guy says to the doctor: \u201cYeah, yeah, I already know that, but what we can do? My American doctor wants to operate and amputate my penis!\u201d\n\nThe Chinese doctor shakes his head and laughs: \u201cStupid Amelican docta, always want to opelate. Make more money, that way.

Now the second guy goes in the room, for a brief moment the supervisor hears nothing, as soon as the gun goes off he hears someone scream and then the room becomes silent again. The second guy walks out of the room, the supervisor asked what happened and the guy replies, \" the gun your gave me had nothing but blanks so I killed him with the chair.\"",

If you think it\u2019s utterly senseless then you were either brainwashed or you've chosen to forget.\n\nIt\u2019s not about killing classmates and teachers because you hate them, to put what school shootings is into a single phrase they are a \u2018cannibalistic protest.\u2019 How do I know this? Because I experienced many dimensions of hating school. In elementary I was a nerd who was respected and I didn't get picked on, I still hated school. In middle school I grew into a cool kid who girls liked with a lot of friends I was in advanced classes and I still hated school. In high-school I moved to a new city for 9th grade, I was awkward, I didn't know anyone and I didn't want to make friends; I was a loser who used to be a winner and guess what, I still hated school. I moved back home and the rest of high-school I was a pot-head and guess what? I kinda started to like school, maybe it was the pot maybe it was maturity\u2026.\n\nSo what does the \u2018cannibalistic protest\u2019 hope to accomplish?? It\u2019s domestic terrorism pure and simple\u2026 But also like the subject of this essay it\u2019s not so simple and it is another phrase that needs defining. Everyone knows what terrorism is but what inspires terrorism is a lot different. And then there\u2019s the domestic part, so what it\u2019s like a house cat compared to a stray cat or a wild tiger? In every case terrorism results from decades, perhaps centuries of corruption and mistreatment of the lower classes by the ruling classes\u2026\n\nThere really is no more complete of a way to \u2018nut-shell\u2019 what causes terrorism. Whether it\u2019s suicide bombing, school shootings, or witch burning it\u2019s all terrorist activity. Suicide bombing because war has changed and there is no honor to it anymore, school shootings because schools wont change and there is not enough room for sanity anymore, and witch burning which represents the horror resulting out of the ignorance of culture\u2026\n\nSo a cannibalistic protest is a form of terrorism\u2026 Okay? dot dot dot\n\nLets try a thought experiment\u2026 Pretend you\u2019re a kid who shot up your school, daamn, I thought being a loser was the worst thing you could be\u2026 Now rewind a year or so before you actually went through with the shooting. What kind of thoughts do you have while at school? Exactly, you have thoughts like a cannibal who wants to protest but there\u2019s no one to protest with because cannibalism is as taboo as taboo gets\u2026You\u2019re starting to get it.... Now think\u2026 What country has the most school shootings\u2026 America, where the first amendment to our sacred text declares that speech is free with? That\u2019s right, Guns! So a gun has become a tool of protest for the non-democratic prison-like education daycare that our youth must endure as a form of un-paid military training to prepare them for a life of overworking underpaid or overpaid under-fulfilled bullshit\u2026\n\nWhen you are an army of one or just a few but everyone else is armed with pencils, a gun can make a loud noise\u2026.\n\nSeriously though\u2026 Everyday you have to go to school (unpaid work) for 8 hours listening to underpaid \u2018adults\u2019 many of which have failed at their first second or maybe 3rd career choice, you\u2019re judged constantly put in social situations where sick cliques develop, people take on roles, the friends you grow up with change, move away, or just turn on you\u2026 Your parents don\u2019t understand because they spent the last decade trying to forget their entire childhood and young adulthood (basically all the events leading up to them getting married and your being born). Their marriage failed and you\u2019re unsure when the heavy drinking began\u2026 Before or after the marriage was over\u2026 Before or after you became depressed\u2026 [You think about shooting up the school not because you hate the other people but because you love them but you\u2019re so full of hate everyday in the same cycle year after year that you can only feel the hatred\u2026 That\u2019s why you have to blow holes in them to let the love leak out (did I make the subject funny yet). In all seriousness, there\u2019s so much confusion, so many emotions in a brain still so young and underdeveloped.]\n\nWhy don\u2019t we focus more on actually making students smarter instead of cramming useless information in with the same cheap strategies giving tests and grades as if studying actually makes you better at anything other than studying\u2026 I\u2019m not going to die a skeptic because I haven\u2019t lived as a skeptic because my whole fucking life is sapped by the exhaustive feelings of hatred I have towards this undemocratic system which in a nut shell REALLY hasn't changed in two-hundred years\u2026 I hate what humanity becomes while a part of it I hate what we think we are as a result of it like no one is real like nothing is real we\u2019re just personalities which are a product of how often we\u2019re prodded by other personalities well I have a personality too and a prod I call Glock\u2026 Run pencil dat!",

I went there to play in a coffeehouse in East Orange New Jersey.  \n\nIt was a chess playing coffeehouse out there.  It was so bad, uh, so bad, people playing chess out there.  Uh, that's all I thought about was chess and chess and chess.  People come up to me, you play a song, and play a real quiet song and in the middle of the song you hear \"check\" and \"hey they was a good move!\" and all kinds of stuff like that.\n\nAnd folks, it was so bad I had a little dream out there the first night I worked about this chess playing stuff.  I dreamt I went to work out in East Orange New Jersey and uh by the time I quit in two days and I went there to ask the guy for my money.\n\nI says \"Can I have some money I worked two days for you\" - he says \"uh well okay we don't pay money around here though\" - and I says \"uh, yeah?\" - he says \"uh well,\" he says \"uh yeah we pay chess men.\" - I said \"uh well give me my chess men then I worked two days\" - I sort of - didn't really figure - I thought he was lying at first but I took it anyway.\n\nHe gave me a king and a queen for working two days.  I said fine I said okay.  So I took my king and queen went down to a bar.  Nearest bar I could find I walked in the bar and I ordered a pint.  I got in the bar.  Bartender I says \"Can I have a pint?\"  I'll be damned if he didn't give me a pint. \n\nHe uh, asked me for the money.  I gave him my king and queen.  I'll be damned.  He took took that king and queen, threw them under the counter and brought me out four pawns, two bishops and a rook for change.  That's a story about East Orange New Jersey.\"",

At a morning press conference, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said \nhe believes the man is a member of the notorious Al-Gebra movement. He is being charged by the FBI with \ncarrying weapons of math instruction. \"Al-gebra is a fearsome cult,\" Gonzales said. They desire average \nsolutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in a search of absolute value.\nThey use secret code names like 'x' and 'y' and refer to themselves as unknowns, but we have determined \nthey belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country. \nAs the Greek philanderer Isosceles used to say, \"There are 3 sides to every triangle.\"\nWhen asked to comment on the arrest, a TSA employee obtusely said, \"If God had wanted us to have better \nweapons of math instruction, he would have given us more fingers and toes.\"Tomorrow I intend to go to \nthe hill and address Congruence about this situation. I have a volume of suggestions and a finite series \nof common solutions for them to consider.\u201d The President then warned, \u201cThese weapons of math instruction \nare without parallel and have the potential to decimal everything on a scalene never before seen unless \nwe become exponents of an infinity Higher Power and begin to factor-in random facts of kindness. If we \nenter a phase in which all nations are integrated in all degrees of purpose, that steady state will give \nus slope for a better tomorrow, and we will all be infinitely better off. In such a case we could have \nour pi and eat it too.\u201d The President further declared, \u201cI am gratified that we have been given a sine \nthat al-Gebra is protracting this situation with calculusing disregard. Their murky statisticians plan \nto inflict plane of new dimensions on every sphere of influence,\u201d he added. \u201cUnder these circumferences, \nwe must differentiate their roots, make our points, draw our lines, and proportionally intersect these \npeople throughout whatever area of the domain they range. And, above all, we must make sure that they \ncan\u2019t get their hands on radii active materials. That is one thing you can secant. What we need is a higher \nquotient of linguists embedded with our troops so that they can interpolate the gibberish that al-Gebra \nuses to communicate. If we had that capability, we could periodically reach new limits of success as \neasily as falling off a natural log. Anything short of that could lead to some real, not imaginary, \ncomplex circumstances.\u201d The Secretary of Homeland Security added, \u201cAs our Great Leader would say, \n\u2018Read my ellipse.\u2019 The one angle that I am uncertainty of is that although al-Gebra will probability try \nto continuously multiply in theorem, their days are numbered as we draw the hypotenuse ever tighter \naround their necks.\u201d",

The woman is slightly more concerned now and asks what he meant. Again the husband replies not to worry about it.\nSome more time passes and the weather turns a bit and the sky goes dark. There's a loud clap of thunder from the distance and this really scares the horse who rears up on it's hind legs throwing the riders off, but thankfully no one was hurt. The man is furious now though. He pulls out a revolver he's carrying, walks to the horse and says \" horse, that's fucking three\" and shoots the horse in the head. \nThe woman sees all this and starts freaking out. She's hysterical, screaming and crying, calling him all sorts of names.

A lion is to be released into the forest. Whoever catches it the quickest is the winner. \n\nFirst NYPD starts. The lion is released. NYPD officers follow it into the jungle. After a couple of hours they are back with the lion in ropes.\n\nNext the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has a go. The lion is released and they follow it on horseback. In an hour they are back, with the lion in tow.\n\nScotland Yard goes next and they are even faster. They get the animal back in half an hour.\n\nLast but not least, *Dilli* Police's turn comes. The lion is released and four mustachioed *Sardars* carrying *Lathis* (bamboo sticks) chase after him in a Jeep. The time passes and the organizers look on. An hour goes by, then two and then five, but they do not return. So the people in-charge go into the jungle to investigate. They drive for a long time through the dense foliage. After some time, they start hearing shrieks and screams close-by. They head towards the sound. They reach a clearing and what they see astounds them. The *Dilli* Police have a Bear tied to a tree and are beating it with their *Lathis* and screaming *\"Bol tu sher hai\"* (\"Confess that you are a Lion\").\n\n\n\n\n>This is not my joke.

Soon, it died completely and they were stranded on the side of a state highway with little traffic.\n\nFortunately, a pick up truck pulled over to help. The driver was a comely middle aged woman in jeans and a work shirt. She told them the closest town with a mechanic was 60 miles away, and since it was past 5:00 pm they would be closed anyway until the next day.\n\nIn a gesture of Texas hospitality, she invited them to stay the night at her ranch which was nearby. Then they could call the garage in town to get their car fixed in the morning.\n\nThe two salesmen were very appreciative, and climbed into the pickup with her.\n\nSoon they turned into a gate, and began driving through a lovely farm where cattle were grazing behind neatly built fences. As they drove she told them how she and her late husband had run this farm for years before he had died from a heart attack two years ago. Now it was just her running things, and it got lonely out here so she was glad for the chance to have guests.\n\nBefore long they pulled up to a very nice ranch house surrounded by a white fence and with a big barn nearby. \n\n\nOnce inside, the widow rancher made them comfortable on the big front porch and brought them cold iced tea before proceeding inside to cook a delicious home cooked meal for them. After dinner they chatted in the living room for a few hours before she showed them to the guest bedroom where they found a comfortable bed with down pillows and a homemade quilt.\n\nIn the morning the widow made them an enormous breakfast while they waited for the tow truck to come collect their car. \n\n\nWhen the wrecker came, they bid the kind widow a fond farewell and she sent them on their way with a bag of cookies for later.\n\nSoon their car was repaired and they were on their way again.\n\nAbout nine months had passed when one of the salesman called the other.\n\n\"Bob, do you remember about nine months ago when our car broke down in West Texas?\"\n\n\"Yes, Ted. I remember that.\"\n\n\"And Bob, do you remember that very kindly widow that took us in for the night?\"\n\n\"Well of course I remember her Ted.\"\n\n\"Well Bob, I have to ask you something.\"\n\n\"Ok Ted.\"\n\n\"Bob, did you slip out of the guest room that night?\"\n\nYes Ted, I did.\"\n\n\"And Bob, did you go to the widow's room that night?\"\n\n\"I did Ted.\"\n\n\"Did you and the widow make love Bob?\"\n\n\"Yes, we did Ted\"\n\n\"Now Bob, this is very important. Did you by chance use MY name that night when you slept with her?\"\n\n\"I did Ted. I'm ashamed of myself, but I did. I'm really, really sorry Ted....\"\n\n\"Oh, that's ok Bob. I just wanted to call and let you know that she died and left me the ranch in her will.\"\n\nThat ones for you Coach!",

Mel Famey of the Milwaukee Braves was a natural .. a once-in-a-lifetime phenom whose fast ball blew away the best hitters. His 90 MPH curveball would start out like it was going to hit the batter's ear, only to break at the last instant and hit the outside corner of the plate for a strike. His changeup made the best hitters in the league cry .. they would swing, drop the bat, and stare increduously as the ball hit the catcher's mitt. He was indeed awesome!\n\nWhy then, you might ask, is he not in the Hall of Fame? Why haven't you ever heard of him? Alas, like many others before him, Mel's downfall was .. alcohol. Ol' Mel really liked to tilt the glass. His drinking became almost legendary around the country, but he never let it affect his pitching until ... this happened.\n\nThe Braves and the Yankees in the World Series! Excitement reigned! The series was tied at three games apiece, and the Braves were in New York for the seventh and deciding game. The night before the big event, Mel's thirst got the better of him. He snuck out of the hotel after curfew, and bought himself two cases of beer. As you might imagine, the next morning Mel didn't feel too good. But being the pro that he was, Mel managed to do just fine .. until the bottom of the ninth inning. With the Braves ahead by one run, two out and the bases loaded, Mel's revelry the night before finally caught up to him. Eight straight pitches .. eight straight balls. He walked in the tieing and the winning runs, losing the game and the series.\n\nAfter the game, a reporter went to the jubilant Yankee's clubhouse and spoke to the last two players that faced Mel. \"Tell me,\" he asked, \"to what do you attribute this victory over the best pitcher in the major leagues?\"\n\nIn unison they replied, \"It was the beer that made Mel Famey walk us!\"",

He decided that he hadn't gone since he was a kid, so he'd go to this one for old time's sake.\n\nOn the day of, he decided that he'd wear the new shirt he'd bought, a very comfy pink sweater, and every act of the show was amazing.\n\nAbout halfway into the show, however, they dimmed the lights in the tent, and a spotlight started roaming through the audience while one of the clowns watched. When the spotlight moved past our pink-shirted friend, the clown yelled out to stop, and immediately started making fun of the sweater. It got so bad that the guy got up out of his seat, and left in tears.\n\nWhen he got home, he vowed that if the same circus came into town again, he'd be prepared and wouldn't let it happen again. So he began to look up information on clowns. He searched online, went to libraries, and found clown groups on social media to ask questions from.\n\nStill not satisfied though, he decided he needed a more hands-on approach, so he enrolled in clown college, and after two years of mind-numbing research, projects, and tests, came away with his degree and the highest honours.\n\nAt the end of his course, for being one of the top three students, he was offered a spot in one of the most prestigious institutes, to continue his studies and learn more about the origins of clowning, and also of offshoots like miming. He accepted, and spent another grueling five years becoming a master clown.\n\nFinally, upon completing his studies, he went back home exhausted, but proud of his accomplishments. He knew now that he'd be ready. And sure enough, only a few months later on his way to work again, there was another billboard for the same circus, this time with a picture of the same clown who had ridiculed him.\n\nThis was his moment to shine. His years of preparation were finally about to pay off. So he put on the exact same pink sweater, and made his way to the circus.\n\nAgain about halfway through the show, they started shining the spotlight around the tent, and again the clown yelled out to stop on the pink sweater.\n\n\"Didn't get enough last time we were in town?\" The clown asked with a laugh. \"You want me to make sure you leave crying again?\"\n\nThat was when the guy stood up, brimming with confidence, and thinking back to his years of learning and training, and said \"You know what?

My wife and I loved to come here together shd it would make this old man's day just to hear a good one\".  The trainer proceeds to say \"oh man I've got a good one that happened just yesterday. I was over here cleaning the deck by shamu's tank.  He was swimming around having a good old time when all of a sudden I heard this WHOOO WHOOO, and down comes crashing this bundle of feathers just covered in tree sap. WHOOO WHOO it kept crying out, then something amazing happened. Shamu dashes to the edge of the tank and starts showering the thing with water from its blow hole.  Next thing you know, the bird spreads it's wings and begins to fly away, but not before giving shamu a wink and a nod.\" Really? That's amazing\", the old man said. \"Oh that's not it.  It gets better\" said the trainer. \"The hooting bird was only flying fir a second before it landed right over there by that tree, just under that buzzing hive. Out spotted one of the workers had fallen out of the hive and got stuck on a drop of tree sap too. The bird was had been there so it proceeded to use is beak to gently pry each leg free for the insect. At that point it started to fly back to the hive but not before tipping its antenna back at the bird who also flew away... After the story the old man was astonished. \"So your telling me, shamus saved a bird who winked back at him and in turn saved a bug who tips his agenda back at him?\"  The trainer says \"yup\".  The old man said \"whale owl bee... I can't believe it!\"",

Thus prompting them to establish elaborate sexual fantasies around the woman and what they can pick up from their lower legs, if they paint their toenails, their shoes, their calluses, how toned their calves are from their athleticism, etc. One day they both go into the monitor room and see the most beautiful pair of legs they have ever seen and collectively articulate a grand romantic fantasy that they wish to be a part of with the woman they belong to. Eventually they become so infatuated that one says he is going to ask her out, and leaves to go talk to her, but first decided to rub one out for clarity. When he comes back from the bathroom he sees that his colleague has gathered his courage and has already started knocking on the dressing room stall. \"Excuse me mam' could I speak to you for a second?\" he says. \"What is the meaning of this?\" replys a deep, male voice.\n\n\"Um, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"If you are in fact a 'sir', then you can't be in here, this is the ladies dressing room.\"\n\n\"Oh my god! This is so embarrassing! I will get out of here as soon as I can!\"\n\nThe man fully clothes himself in a heartbeat and exits the room, apologizing profusely: \"...and again I am terribly sorry I was not in there for anything other than my utter ineptitude, please don't take it the wrong way.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's not a problem, happens to the best of us.\"\n\n\"So, what did you want to see me about?\" inquired the man.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"you know, why were you in there originally?\"\n\n\"Oh you know, standard guard policy.\"\n\n\"It's standard policy to randomly knock on dressing room doors?\"\n\n\"Well, you were acting a little suspicious.\"\n\n\"Suspicious?\"\n\n\"Yeah, you looked like you were ready to steal clothes\"\n\n\"So you fallow anyone who looks like they might be ready to steal clothes when they go into the ladies dressing room?\"\n\n\"Well yeah, ESPECIALLY if they're a man.\"\n\n\"Makes sense.

I had eye drops in and I changed before school so I wasn't worried at all. While I was waiting outside the principle's office I realized that I never bought a raffle ticket. I figured maybe someone bought one in my name or something until I remembered it's april fool's day. I let out a small chuckle and was about to get up and leave when the door opens behind me and the principle says \"what can I do for ya?\"\nMe:[very nervously] Oh, um... nevermind. My friends played an april fools joke on me I'm just gonna head back to class.\nPrinciple: haha ok, you're not high are you?\nMe:[FUUUUCKKKKK] What? No just really tired\nPrinciple: Oh OK nevermind, have a good day\nWhat makes it even worse is during my walk of shame back to the cafeteria I realized we don't even have a school raffle.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nI showed up to work at 5:45 like usual.

Anyways, I get to my office and there's this frickin' massive ass gummy bear on my desk. I ignored it for a while, because I figured it was a prank of some kind. It was towards the end of 2nd period and the munchies were kicking in hard. At this point I was straight surfing at a [6] or so, but I made sure I had eye drops in so nobody suspected that I was high. I had to suppress the munchies, so I started tearing down on this fruity, chewy, ursidae. I was sitting there eating when I heard someone outside the door. I was FREAKING out, I thought someone figured out I was high or something so as calm as possible I open the door to find this kid sitting in the chairs outside my door and I say \"h-how can I help ya\"\nKid: Oh, um... nevermind. My friends played an april fools joke on me I'm just gonna head back to class.\nMe being a stoned idiot asks him..\nMe: haha ok, hey you're not high are you?\nKid: What? No just really tired\nMe: Oh haha OK nevermind, have a good day\nSo he walks off and I'm all like, what the fuck dude. Then I realized what happened. The gummy bear was a prize for the stupid raffle we had that day. I told the staff not to have it on the first, but they did it anyway. Now I'm sitting here wondering if he's going to come back, and what I do if he does.",

The doctor tells Timmy that his voice will never get deeper naturally, but, he can make it deeper by shoving a special plug in his butt.  Timmy is ecstatic.  The doctor tells him to put the plug in before school every day and take it out once he gets home.  The next day Timmy wakes up for school and immediately  puts in his new plug, his voice drops **very** much from his new plug.  That day when he walks to school his usual bullies yell at him and say \"Hey Timmy you fuckin' pussy your voice is so high! HAHAHAHAHA!\"  Timmy, feeling confident with his new voice yells back \"**Hey fuck you guys! You guys are the pussies!**\"  His new voice scares the bullies and they run away.  School goes great and when Timmy gets home he takes his plug out, just like the doctor said.  The next morning Timmy wakes up and immediately puts his plug in again \"**Ughhhh**\" he groans as he puts it in.  Again on his way to school he gets yelled at by the same bullies, who obviously never learn, \"Timmy you fucking pussy your voice is so damn high! HAHAHAHHAA!\"  Again, with his new voice Timmy bellows back \"**I'm gonna fuck you guys up if you don't get the fuck out of my face, you pussies!**\"  Again the bullies run away scared.  The third day comes and Timmy wakes up but forgets to put in his plug. He starts to walk to school and for some reason the bullies still have not learned their lesson, \"Timmy you big fat vagina why is your voice so HIGH! HAHHAHAHA!\" Once again Timmy yells back ^\"Hey ^shuttup ^you ^fuckin-\"  As soon as he realizes what has happened Timmy sprints home, his bullies chasing after him, cackling.  As soon as Timmy gets home he sprints up to his room and looks everywhere but cannot find his plug!  Fed up, he asks him mom for help, ^\"Mom ^have ^you ^seen ^my ^plug?! ^I ^can't ^find ^it ^anywhere!\"  He runs down to his mom, who seems quite flustered and she responds with a very hearty \"**N-No son, I'm sorry, but you just forget about that and go back to school!**\"",

So, please allow her body to switch with mine for a day. '\n\n\nGod, in his infinite wisdom, granted the man's wish. The next morning, sure enough, the man awoke as a woman... He arose, cooked breakfast for his mate, Awakened the kids, Set out their school clothes, Fed them breakfast, Packed their lunches, Drove them to school, Came home and picked up the dry cleaning, Took it to the cleaners And stopped at the bank to make a deposit, Went grocery shopping, Then drove home to put away the groceries, Paid the bills and balanced the check book. He cleaned the cat's litter box and bathed the dog.. Then, it was already 1 P.M. And he hurried to make the beds, Do the laundry, vacuum, Dust, And sweep and mop the kitchen floor. Ran to the school to pick up the kids and got into an argument with them on the way home. Set out milk and cookies and got the kids organized to do their homework. Then, set up the ironing board and watched TV while he did the ironing. At 4:30 he began peeling potatoes and washing vegetables for salad, breaded the pork chops and snapped fresh beans for supper. After supper, He cleaned the kitchen, Ran the dishwasher, Folded laundry, Bathed the kids, And put them to bed. At 9 P.M. He was exhausted and, though his daily chores weren't finished, he went to bed where he was expected to make love, which he managed to get through without complaint. \n\n\nThe next morning, he awoke and immediately knelt by the bed and said: - Lord, I don't know what I was thinking. I was so wrong to envy my wife's being able to stay home all day. Please, Oh! Please, let us trade back.. Amen!' The Lord, in his infinite wisdom, replied: \"My son, I feel you have learned your lesson and I will be happy to change things back to the way they were. But you'll have to wait nine months, though. You got pregnant last night\".",

        "body": "One such example occurred in the 11th century, with the three belligerents being the French, the English (Anglos) and the Vikings. The rivalry between each group was quite intense, and unlike other situations, the two weaker groups at the time did not join together to fight the strongest. Instead, this conflict involved three opposing sides, each one of them desperately wanting victory.\n\n\nHowever, as the war meandered on, it became evident to the vikings and French that the Anglos were in the better position. The leaders of both sides decided to set aside their differences and unite against the Anglos. However, English spies determined that the two other sides were making a treaty and notified Anglo government. This led the Anglo king to make a decision to send one his best officers to supervise the signing of the treaty. Not wanting the French and Vikings to catch on to his actions, he decided to have the officer pose as a Germanic feudal king.\n\nOn November 11th 1069 (this date has been debated by historians, due to the conversion to the Gregorian calendar), the French and Vikings signed the historic peace treaty in an undisclosed location in France (most historical evidence from this date is lost; documents were presumed to be destroyed by Mongol invaders). Unbeknownst to the French and Vikings, the Anglo officer would be in the room during the official signing of the treaty.\n\nSome say it was his charisma, others say it was his disguise, but historians have verified that the Anglo spy (named Trigon O'Metry) somehow convinced his enemies to permit to sign below their names as a witness. Thus, the era of British espionage began, and the two opposing sides conducted business as usual, neither of their leaders being none the wiser.\n\nEarly war industries in France and Sweden worked in overdrive, producing twice the weapons and military supplies than they had earlier, due to the cooperation between the nations. In a poor decision on both sides' part (which ultimately led to the end of the war), both the French and the Vikings decided to pool their resources, sending fleets of vessels into the middle of the sea. The whole fleet would contain all of the resources each empire produced, which if you remember, was twice the normal output. In addition, the French and Vikings each sent their best squire, in preparation for their invasion of the Anglo empire. However, the Anglos knew that they were coming (mostly due to the effectiveness of their spies) so they had sent their best squire, whom they had trained for months. This squire swam all the way across the English channel to the coast of France, where he would single-handedly conquer the French empire.\n\nNot everything went so well for the British. Suspicion by the French general Al-Titude led to the discovery of the British spy. So, O'Metry was then sent to board the vanguard of the Viking-French fleet (or the French-Viking fleet, depending where you're from). However, this fleet was virtually unguarded, which allowed the British to capture them easily.\n\nSo began the course of the final battle of the war. The British, having captured the Viking-French fleet and holding it in the French port city of Paris, possessed nearly all of the firepower of the opposing sides. In addition to this, the British rescued their POW spy. The only thing left to defeat was the French and Viking squire, who were stationed in Bordeaux with a new mission to repel the incoming British invasion. Little is known about the battle, but the following is certain:\n\nThe squire of the side opposite the Anglo is equivalent to the sum of the squires of the two opposite sides minus twice the products of the opposite sides and the cosign of the Anglo.\n",

        "body": "Meaning that it involved the mass mobilization of a country's resources. Britain was one of the nations that really felt the effects of the so called \"total war\", as civilians played a greater role in the military than ever before. Even though they were geographically separated from the rest of Europe, they were hit hard by the war. German shipping blockades cut off foreign supply, which meant that supplies had to be rationed, and many raw materials went towards the war effort, used in industrial production. This led to a shortage of some fabrics such as silk and cotton.Additionally, the British government demanded food rations be given to its people. As a result, many nutritional foods were scarce.\n\nIn response to the scarcity of fabric for clothing production, a British sheep farmer named Calvin Broadus invented a new type of fabric, which he called \"tweed\". This fabric was made of wool, but the British military found no practical use for it in the war effort. Due to the abundance of sheep in the United Kingdom, farmers everywhere started producing tweed, as Broadus' method was circulated rapidly by the British government.\n\nAs with the military, British civilians found few practical uses of the new \"wonder material\". It had poor insulation, was rough to wear, and it shrunk easily when washed, and most importantly didn't look fashionable. It seemed as though the war drained British creativity too, as fashion designers could find no suitable design with tweed. They settled with creating plaid designs with a few dull colors, since these could be produced more efficiently.\n\nAs the war moved on, Germany's control of mainland Europe and the water around Britain decreased. With the Americans now in the war, Britain's military centered industry (some would say a precursor the military industrial complex) had a break. The United States, with its large amount of resources, picked up some of the slack, reducing Britain's quota of war production. This meant good news for the British textile industry, which was reduced to producing for the war. Upper class British people could afford to buy expensive fabrics that were not available to them, such as the cotton and silk mentioned above. However, since the war was still going on, these materials were extremely expensive, so only British aristocrats could buy them.\n\nIn addition, excess tweed manufacturing gave Britain a surplus- they were left with more of this useless fabric than ever. British families were given large amounts of tweed. Some people tried making the tweed into useful items, like blankets, but due to its poor ductility, it took a long time to manufacture them. With British men in the military, women took up manufacturing jobs, in addition to their duties at home, which meant they were left with little time to deal with their surplus of tweed at home.\n\nWomen in London first discovered a useful application of tweed. By sheer luck, historians claim, these women discovered that burning a strand of tweed for a long time over a fire would produce a fibrous strand that was edible and nutritious. Scientists today found out that this product was nutritious due to ammonium nitrate in the sheeps' grazing land. The process of creating this fibrous food was still long, and it took about 12 hours. In order to increase efficiency (we see a pattern here), various women would prepare this in bulk amounts in city parks. During this time period, you would see bonfires throughout open spaces in the city, since British women were burning fabric. However, historians have discovered no pictures of these events, since the British government forbade photography (or destroyed photos) of this process as not to reveal secrets to the enemy.\n\nThe British military saw a problem in the post-tweed manufacturing process. German planes would be able to spot cities since there were large \"tweed bonfires\" as the process of making the fibrous food extended past daytime. So, the British government mandated that tweed production into food would only occur during the day, as not to assist the nighttime German blitzkriegs. This was seen as only a mild inconvenience to city-dwelling British people, but it still took all day, from sunrise to sunset, to produce this food.\n\nIn 1945, this process died out, since the war ended. This is why you do not see people doing this today. Due to the effectiveness of British intelligence, this process had been relatively unknown to foreigners. This changed, when in 1996 a man named Cordozar Broadus was walking his dog in a park in Manchester. They reached a heavily wooded section of the park, and his curious, but nosy dog unearthed a series of tools that were used in the tweed refining process. Broadus remembered seeing his father's war notes after snooping around in the attic. His father's extremely detailed notes described the procedure of tweed production. The inspired Broadus decided to do more research into the subject, but he was shut down by the British government. In 1998, Broadus, now a musical artist, decided to slowly reveal this secret, in an album, but under an alias (so the government wouldn't suspect him).\n\nTo credit his mischievous mutt, he used the pseudonym \"Snoop Dogg\", and released his single, \"Smoke Tweed Everyday.\"\n",

        "body": "      Boris took a break from polishing the deep, rich, black paint on his cherished Chevrolet Impala. \n\nHis thoughts drifted back to the fine April day in nineteen sixty-three when he first saw the car sitting on the showroom floor. It was only a matter of hours before he\u2019d purchased the car, and was driving it with the convertible top down. The dazzling mid-day sun glistened off of the chrome as his wavy black hair blew in the breeze. Within a few months, his bright world would be drastically altered. His older brother started dating a very eerie young woman, and soon after his behavior had also become disturbing. He awakened one night to a pain in his neck, and the two of them standing over him, laughing. He stared into the night sky and a wave of melancholy swept over him, as he reflected that one of the things he dreaded most about being a vampire, was not being able to drive with the top down on bright sunny days. He resumed his polishing, and when it was done he put the top up and drove the car into the garage. The sun would be rising soon and he needed to get to bed.\n\nWhen he opened the door between the garage and the kitchen, he was greeted with his brother\u2019s sarcasm.\n\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t seem to get it through your head that you\u2019re dead, can you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been a vampire for as long as I have.\u201d Boris leaned on the back of a chair, and continued in a low deliberate voice, \u201cYou should know by now that we\u2019re neither alive nor dead. We\u2019re undead.\u201d\n\n\u201cA technicality, but it still doesn\u2019t justify spending all your time with that mechanical icon of the living world. Look, dummy. You can turn into a bat and fly. You don\u2019t need a car anymore. When will you ever get that through your thick skull?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared of bats and even more afraid of heights, and, besides, you\u2019re a good one to talk about hanging on to the living world. I see you\u2019re stuffing that big gut of yours full of Oreo cookies again. When you fly, you show up on the radar screens as big as the space shuttle. Now if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to bed, and hopefully you haven\u2019t turned down the heat on my waterbed again.\u201d\n\nBoris started to leave the room as his brother replied. \u201cIt seems to me that I\u2019ve reminded you before that vampires can\u2019t cross water, and if you had any self respect you\u2019d sleep in a proper coffin.\u201d\n\nHe spoke over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m not crossing water. I\u2019m sleeping on it. Besides coffins are for dead people. When I\u2019m dead I\u2019ll sleep in a coffin. Good night.\u201d\n\nBoris slowly climbed the steps to his room and wearily opened the door. He checked the thermostat on the waterbed to insure that it hadn\u2019t been disturbed, and then climbed into the bed. After drawing the shades and securing all light sources, he snuggled into the heap of blankets and was soon asleep.\nHe awakened feeling rested, and rose slowly from the comfort of his bed.\n\nOnly a few wispy clouds obscured an otherwise clear sky as he sat on the front porch gazing at the stars. He rested his elbows on his knees and his chin in the palms of his hands, and thought out loud, \u201cAll I want is to be able to drive my convertible on a nice sunny day. Is that too much to ask?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d A soft, but unexpected voice spoke from behind him.\nBoris turned around to see who spoke it. Standing on the porch was a spectacularly beautiful woman with extremely fair skin, dressed in a flowing white gown with small wings gently fluttering in the peaceful evening breezes.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d As soon as he said it, he realized that it wasn\u2019t one of his best opening lines.\n\u201cI\u2019m Desiree, a Fairy, and I\u2019ve come to grant you a wish.\u201d\n\u201cI thought Fairies only collected teeth.\u201d\n\u201cThe boss likes us to keep busy, so on slow days we do other things. I understand that you have something that you wish dearly for.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I want nobody can give me.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure. If you don\u2019t ask, you\u2019ll never know.\u201d She brushed past him as she slowly walked over to the car.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already heard what I want, so why do I have to ask?\u201d\n\u201cHumor me.\u201d A sly smile, displaying tantalizing dimples, graced her face while her hands gently caressed the shiny black paint.\nBoris thought for a minute, and then spoke slowly. \u201cI want to drive my car on a nice warm sunny morning without the fear of dying. Can you do that?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s done. Your wish is granted. Tomorrow morning you can drive your car without worrying about dying. I do have one request though.\u201d\n\u201cI knew there had to be a catch. What is it?\u201d\n\u201cI want to go along.\u201d\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d\n\u201cI love this car, and I\u2019ve never had the opportunity to ride in a convertible.\u201d\nBoris smiled sheepishly and held his hand out to her. \u201cMeet me here at five-thirty. I want to watch the sunrise while we drive.\u201d\nDesiree took his hand and rubbed it to her cheek, and then fluttered off.\n\nAfter she left, Boris picked up a rag and commenced polishing the finish to remove her hand prints. She may be cute, but he had his limits.\n\nDesiree returned right on time. Boris opened the door for her, then walked around the car and took his position at the steering wheel. The sun was not up yet, but beams of light turned the clouds that were visible to varied shades of pink and purple. He drove to a park where he\u2019d spent much of his youth. It was the first time he\u2019d seen it in daylight in many years. He drove slowly and took time to enjoy the reflections off the water in the pond, and the way the light played through the trees, creating eerie shadows on the ground. These were sights he hadn\u2019t seen in years, and he wanted to relish each and every one of them. He emerged from the cover of the trees just as the sun made its entrance. Immediately the skin on his hands began to bubble, and his breathing became labored.\n\nHe shrieked in horror, \u201cYou lied to me. You told me I\u2019d be able to live when the sun came up.\u201d\nDesiree smiled and calmly replied, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I only promised you that you could drive without worrying about dying. That\u2019s exactly what you asked for.\u201d\nBoris staggered from the car in an attempt to find cover, and amid screams of agonizing pain, he burned to a cinder in the middle of the road. Desiree slowly slid across the red vinyl bench seat, placed her hands on the steering wheel, and took some time to admire her new car. After a few moments she turned around and spoke in disgust to the smoldering clump \u201cA basic Impala! \nYou could have at least had enough class to buy a Super Sport.\u201d She turned back, put the car in gear, and drove off into the sunrise.\nYou know all those dark spots on the pavement that you thought were patched potholes \u2013 uh uh. Melted vampires. ",

        "body": "He sleeps in the most comfortable bed he's ever slept in. In the middle of the night he hears a beautiful noise that wakes him up, even from the amazing bed he is laying on. He realises that the noise is coming from a door in the corner of his room. He decides not to get up and goes back to sleep.\n\nThe next morning he asks a nearby monk what the noise was. \"I'm sorry I can't tell you,\" he replies, \"you're not a monk.\" So the man asks the monk, \"What will it take to become a monk?\" To which the monk replies, \"We will give you tasks. Each will give you a lesson in patience and equilibrium within yourself.\" \n\nHis first task was to go to the nearby beach and count every grain of sand individually. For the next five years the man wanders the beach, being careful not to lose count or double count any grains. After the trial is done he returns and asks if he can see what is behind the door. The monk replies \"I'm sorry I can't tell you. You're not a monk.\"\n\n\"Your next task is to go to the meadow and count every blade of grass.\" This time, with more patience he treks to the great field and begins his count. The wind being a huge obstacle for him, he counts the blades of grass for the next ten years. Upon his return he asks to see what is behind the door. \"I'm sorry I can't tell you, you are not yet a monk. You have but one more task.\"\n\nThe man is then sent to a forest, spreading over three acres. As he arrives he sees a ladder and a note which reads \"You know what you must do.\" So he begins to count every leaf on every tree. His practice with the monks for the past years of his life have greatly improved his physique, his spirituality, and his intellect. With these traits he is able to climb up and down this ladder and count every leaf with ease. For the next fifteen years he calmly and happily counts, by this time forgetting all about the door.\n\nThe youngest monk before he, now the Elder Monk, is the last of his predecessors to still be alive when he returns from his journey. The Elder monk immediately hands him a key ring and says, \"You have proven yourself worthy. When i die you will become the Elder Monk. Here are the keys required to open the inner sanctum. You may find the first door in the room you layed in on your first say with us.\" The memory of the beautiful noise, and the sight of the key to open in made him break down and begin to cry right then and there. \n\nHe goes to the door, and examines the keyes on the ring. There is a plain metal key, a stone, a very large key, and a Crystal shard. The first door in front of him seems to be a fairly modern door, so he opens it with the plain metal key. After walking down the hall and down the stairs he comes across a stone wall which seems to be a dead end. As he begins to lose hope, he sees a small gap in the stone wall. He pulls out his key ring and places the stone into the wall. The wall decends into the floor, revealing a path ahead of him. \n\nThe path is a mile long and direct, no turns, no lights, and no stairs. As he progresses through the straight pitch black corridor, he begins to see a light. As he gets closer he sees that he is going into a cave, a very large cave. The cave is filled with colorful crystals and marvelous stones. There is a small hole above him which seems to small for any animal to fit through. After about ten minutes wandering through the cave he hears a faint ringing. The hole above him is shining light through various crystals, causing them to vibrate and ring. The refractions of the light end up pointing to a crystal cluster that seems to have a missing crystal. He places the Crystal from his pocket into the cluser, and all the crystals in the cave disintegrate.\n\nHe is immediately filled with sorrow. He believes he just destroyed the source of the beautiful noise he worked so hard to behold. As the tears fall, he lifts his head remembering that he has one more key. He looks around to find that a very large door, previously hidden by the crystals, had been exposed. So he takes the final key from his pocket and opens the door. The second the door flies open, he sees the most amazing wonder he has ever seen in his entire life. It beats the beautiful views he has seen during his time as a monk. It overpowers every beautiful song he had ever heard. Upon seeing this treasure he realises that his life is now complete and understands what it is to not fear death, as he can now die happily.\n\nWould you like to know what he saw?\n\nI'm sorry I can't tell you, you're not a monk.",

Looking around the bar, there are no speakers, no juke box, nothing that he can see that would be creating the music.\n\nGuy:  \"Hey, bartender, where's this music coming from?  It's some of the best piano music I've ever heard.\"\n\nBartender:  \"Look on top of the bar over there.\"\n\n\nAs the man looks down, at the end of the bar, well ON the bar really, there's a little man playing a grand piano roughly the size of a laptop.

The genie says \"I will grant you any 1 wish.\"\n\nThe man thinks it over, and then says \"I would like you to fill up this bar with money, so that everyone here can go home rich.\"  The genie looks at the man, looks around the bar, and claps his hands, saying \"Your wish is my command.\"\n\n\nThe man excitedly spins around, and to his dismay the entire bar is filled with honey.  Sticky.  Fucking.  Honey.\n\nGuy:  \"Really?  What the hell!?

He'd drink one, then go the next one, and then the last one.\n\nSince the dude did this day after day, the bartender couldn't help but notice, and decided to ask the man what was the deal with the three bears.\n\n\"You know\" the bartender said, trying to be as casual as possible, to conceal his curiosity. \"You take a little while to get from one beer to another, the next ones will be warm and washed-out. Why don't you order the first one beer at a time?\"\n\nThe man listened to the question silently, gazing into one of the beers. He looks up and answers with a deep nostalgic voice tone:\n\n\"We used to be unseparable. My friends and I. When we were single, we would every night go to a bar, have our beers and chat. But destiny has it's own reasons, right? We had to drift apart for several reasons: marriage, work... but we swore that we would always keep the good old times alive by going to a bar, and ordering three beers.. knowing the others would be doing it too, wherever they are. My name is Peter, by the way.\"\n\nThe bartender was speechless. It was a damn good reason to do such a silly ritual. So he left the guy alone with his beers.\n\nAnd every night, Peter would appear, order his three beers and chug them quietly in his little corner, without exchanging words with anyone except for the bartender, sometimes about life, sometimes tales about his friendship and the crazy shit they did together. Newman was a smooth ladies-man. Joshua was the one who did everyone laugh. Night after night, three beers in their honour. Then one night, Peter ordered only two beers.\nThe bartender looked to the man with a concerned look - Peter was visibly not alright, and with one beer less, this could only mean one thing: one of his friends had passed. Would it be Newman and his glorious dick? Would it be Joshua? Once again, his curiosity got the best of him.\n\n\"I'm very sorry, Peter. Which one? And.. what happened?\"\n\n\"Nah, they're just fine, I just quit drinking.\"\n\n*chugs*",

His drives are long and straight. His putts are perfect. He hits at least one hole in one in every round he plays. Before long he has the PGA begging him to join the tour, which he does.\n\nAlmost a year to the day after his encounter with the leprechaun, he is back in Ireland and at the same course. Overcome with curiosity, he hits a ball into the brush exactly where he'd lost his ball the year before.\n\nSure enough, when he goes into the bushes he finds the same leprechaun. \n\n\"I'll not be granting you a wish this time\", the leprechaun says. \"The code only requires me to grant you one wish no matter how many times you find me.\"  \"That's ok\", the man replies. \"This wish has been more wonderful than I could ever have imagined! Since we met, I've not lost a round and I've set course records at every course I've played. I've even won three PGA majors already.\"\n\nThe leprechaun smiles, \"Well, that's mighty fine, but how's your sex life been?\"  \"Not bad\", the man answers. The leprechaun is incredulous. \"How many times have you had sex this past year?\"  \"About 5 or 6 times\",  is the man's answer. \"And you call that not bad?!?\" The leprechaun shouts.

He was still healthy and strong, but his skin was dark and leathery from years in the sun and his hair was white like wool and also wild. The wife wore colorful moo-moo style dresses and wore her hair short and curly like most grandmothers her age. She liked to attend church regularly and would help with various church functions. This was back in the 60's and the country was still developing and although it was largely Americanized, there were still bits of native culture that hung around. Most of the time their world was modern though, save for a few ceremonies or festivals. One day the wife headed to a church function to help the women prepare food ahead of time. The husband decided to join her later when the event would actually start. The event starts and people start going through line to get food. Eventually, after people had been sitting, eating, and talking for a few minutes, the old man walks in. The room falls silent. His presence instantly catches their eye. The food practically falls out of their mouth as they see what he is wearing. He was wearing a traditional red loincloth on bottom and, of all things, a big wool sweater on top! The loincloth leaves hardly anything to the imagination and the people sitting down to eat tried not to burst out laughing as this elderly man, with most of his butt cheeks exposed, shuffles through the food line filling his plate. When he has a full plate, he walks over to sit next to wife who is glaring at him. When he sits down she gets right up to his ear and hisses at him, \"Why on earth are you wearing that?!\" He takes a bite and with a mouth full of rice replies, \"What? I was cold.\"",

        "body": "Posted: 3 hours ago $1500 Looking for the AUTHENTIC Wall Street Summer Experience (Financial District) Looking for an apartment within a 4.5 mile radius of Wall Street. My summer internship at an elite bank and starts in late May. Don't worry about rent because you know I'm getting PAID. Must be close to Wall Street. Must be close to nightlife. I fucking tear shit up, and expect those living with me to do the same. I create systems of ALPHA-LIVING, a term I coined myself. Here is what that means:\n\nPreferred Lifestyle: Let me just dive right into it: I work harder than everyone else, and play even harder than I work. And when I say I work hard, I mean I fucking crunch numbers until my NOSE BLEEDS. The harder I work though, the more turned up I get. My endeavors include but are not limited to: lifting weights (home gym is non-negotiable), being woken up by natural sunlight ( this means I need the bedroom facing east), watching anything on Bravo (cable or I'm out), and an in-apartment sauna and/or steam shower (Sauna MUST have some type of audio capabilities). My Russian friend taught me that business gets done there over a good steam. Release the toxins and get ready to rock this city, that's what we're going to do. Speaking of toxins, I rage. I rage hard. Have you ever heard of something called \"the dragon fucking the goat\"? Don't even bother looking it up--I'll show you. Those living with me have to expect two things and two things only: 1. If you bring over hot pussy, I'M GOING TO FUCK IT. I don't care if it's your girlfriend or your grandma. Bottom line: we live in a FREE COUNTRY and I use my dick when and how I want (non-negotiable) 2. I only do bottle service. If you're throwing a party, I don't even care if its a Tuesday night, there has to be bottles and models. Swedish Vaska is welcomed and non-negotiable.\n\nPreferred Roommates: Male preferred but open to females if they understand that things will likely get sexual EXTREMELY QUICKLY and that is entirely out of my control. Roommates must come from a top-tiered Ivy, and be able to pull 2-3 females on a given night (without prior warning) . If you can recite the Dow Jones 30 in order of market cap, we're cool. If you know what LIBOR was today, we're cool. If you don't know what I'm talking about, I suggest you GET A LIFE because that level of knowledge is non-negotiable from my end. I fucking breed greatness and expect something a bit under that from those in my living vicinity ( non-negotiable). This may come as something of a surprise, but I also enjoy doing puzzles. I hope you're into that too cuz I've got some great ones I can bring. Another thing, I DON'T FUCKING SHARE MY WSJ WITH PEOPLE. In college some douche stole it from my steps every morning and I better not see you anywhere near it. And don't ask me for my subscription passwords. I won't share them because I pay for that shit so I can be better than you, not so we can hold hands and skip through a fucking meadow while we read it together. You should know The Game already so don't bother asking me. If you believe anything other than Capitalism, GTFO. Seriously. (Only exceptions is playing Drake's \"Started from the Bottom.\"...but sparingly. If you didn't laugh at that, GTFO) On that note, rap to chill and DUBSTEP FOR PARTYING. If you play anything else I'm going to smash whatever stereo or pussy IPOD DOCK you have ( I don't give two fucks whether its got warranty or not.)\n\nPreferred recreational activities: It should be obvious by now that I work out and that I get huge while I do it. If you are upset by any noises I make while I throw weight up, then buy earplugs. By the way, If I need a spotter, I don't give a fuck who's sleeping...someone is GOING TO SPOT. The last rep is what separates the pussies from the alphas. I also read a lot, but never fiction (if it's not real, then why would you ever read it? It's just something that someone made up in their mind? Holy fuck that's useless). If I see some hipster bullshit like Kurt Vonnegut sitting around I will literally shit in your PILLOW CASE. Don't even tell me you fucking visited the Upper West Side. I go through 2 cases of Montecristo No 2. (straight from the fucking island--UPS requires a fucking signature, so if you're home just do it. ) every week. If you smoke my Cubans, then you'll either pay me cash ( with minimum 10% interest + risk premium which is non-negotiable) on the spot or we're going to have a big problem. I don't lift weights to look pretty, I do it to protect my fucking shit so expect that I will smash your face if you touch my stuff including CUBANs. My alcohol policy is simple: Johnny Walker Red Label. You bring that black label shit and you're GTFO.\n\nAs you can see, for the most part I'm a pretty laid back guy. I will be chill if you are chill but that means following my rules which I've laid out here and AREN'T COMPLICATED. If you got rules of your own feel free to send them to me, although that shit will probably go directly to my SPAM folder ( it's not that I don't have respect for your rules, but they're not as good as mine because these are tried and true and my system works and is therefore non-negotiable).\n\nThose interests should include: LinkedIn profiles, a minimum of one story about your wildest fucking night in college ( USE REAL NAMES), and a picture of the hottest chick you've gotten with (NON-NEGOTIABLE and tits are a major PLUS). I will provide the same but only if I approve of yours so they had better be good and photoshopping WILL BE SNIFFED OUT (this is not some weird pervy thing but just to make sure you're as serious about this as I am).\n\nBy the end of the summer, everyone will fucking know who we are (non-negotiable).\n\ndo NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers\n",

The devil took his analyst's advice and hired Goode Construction Inc to completely surface it with brand new asphalt. They brought in a hundred men and went to work right away.  \nA month went by and the devil grew impatient. The street was simply too large for it to be finished in a reasonable time, even by 100 men. Satan needed it done NOW. Satan was quite a racist and immediately thought of the great productivity of Asian people. He looked in the phone book and found a company named \"Tommy Chinn Construction,\" which sounded promising, so the devil called the number. A man with an Asian accent answered and the devil explained his predicament. Tommy Chinn replied with confidence, \"Oh that be no probrem for us. We send ten men ova right away and it be done in... Mmh.... One day, probabree.\" The devil laughed and didn't believe such a feat was possible for only ten men, but he decided to give them a chance and he would get his money back if they didn't live up to their promise. Tommy Chinn showed up the next morning with his 9 other men and started work at once. Lo and behold, before the sun set over hell, the road was finished. The devil was absolutely ecstatic and was so impressed that he hired them to fix up the rest of hell too. \n\nAnyways, that, my friends, is the story of why the road to hell is paved by Goode and ten Chinns.\n\n(Source: I heard this years ago through a joke book or website and recreated it from memory.

After a couple of days he notices a rash beginning to form on his penis. In another day or so, his member is inflamed, swollen and red. Soon it's burning horribly and dripping pus. Frantic, he searches Bangkok for an American doctor.\n\nAfter examination, the doctor tells him he doesn't know what this terrible disease is, and the only option he sees is to amputate his penis.  The soldier is horrified and demands a second opinion, so the doctor refers him to the only American urologist in Bangkok.\n\nUnfortunately, he too has never seen this disease and is stumped by the symptoms. He also recommends amputation. In tears the soldier asks him if there is any possible way his penis can be saved. The urologist sighs and tells him that well, maybe one of the local Thai doctors has seen this before and can help.\n\nThe soldier rushes out to the office of an old Thai doctor, shows him his member, and tells him that he's already seen two American doctors who recommended that his penis be amputated. \n\nDisgusted, the Thai doctor shakes his head and says, \"All American doctors the same. Always want to cut, cut, cut. Cutting their answer to everything! Stupid American doctors! You don't need to have your dick cut off.\"  A huge smile of relief breaks out on the soldiers face. The old doctor continues, \"In a few days, dick fall off by itself.\"",

It is written that the geeks shall inherit the Earth.\n\nENGINEERING: One of only two signs that actually studied in school, it is said that ninety percent of all personal ads are placed by engineers.

Anyway, the horse sees a segment on Jimi Hendrix, and decides there and then he wants to become an internationally-acclaimed guitar player (because, as we all know, all horses are left-handed).\n\nSo this horse works at this shitty job for a couple of months, earning enough money to buy himself a low-end Strat. He starts playing Hendrix songs in his spare time, trying to recreate the sound he fell in love with. Eventually, he records a few covers and gets on YouTube with them.\n\nNow, this horse thinks he's doing pretty well, and decides to start a band with the other guys from the nearby farm. So he goes up to his friend, that just happens to be a chicken, and tries to get him to be the bass player, as the chicken was a sweet-ass bass player in college. Chicken agrees and decides to bust out his old bass from the attic; they learn the rest of Hendrix's first album.\n\nNow the horse and chicken think they can go pretty far, and decide to ask their friend, that happens to be a cow, if she can play the drums for the band. She agrees, and they all decide to pool their money together to get this awesome fucking set of drums for Cow. So Cow learns the drum parts for all the Hendrix songs, and they reckon they can go really fucking far with this.\n\nBut guess the fuck what? They need a fucking singer to complete the set. So Cow goes up to her friend, who knows can sing like a fucking legend, and asks him to join the band. For the purposes of the joke, the singer is a pig. So Pig learns all the parts for Hendrix's first album and they eventually decide to branch off and make a load of different songs.\n\nThis horse, as the band frontman, gets the band to go global - they start performing at gigs across Europe, Asia and the Americas, with the help of the farmer himself (who was slightly bemused at his animals talking, let alone being a fucking band), and eventually get noticed by none other than Jay Leno himself. Leno invites them to California to perform at his show, which coincided with the kick-off for their cross-US tour.\n\nSo the horse, as the frontman, flies over to California first to set up and make sure the gig runs smoothly. Everything's good, and the rest of the band, a week later, board a plane to California as well.\n\nHowever, the plane ditches into the ocean, sadly killing all the passengers, including the band and the farmer as manager. A couple of days later, Horse hears about this and becomes distraught at the deaths he basically caused.\n\nHorse hits a full-on depression, and decides to kill himself so as to be reunited with his friends. He roams the seedy back-alleys of California, trying to find the shittiest club so as to drown his troubles away. Eventually, he finds one, takes 15 Ketamine pills and walks in. He orders the most alcoholic thing the club can offer, and sits in a corner of the bar, waiting for Death.\n\nThe owner of the club sees this obviously distraught horse, and walks over to him to try and help.\n\n\"Hey,\" he says, \"why the long face?\"",

Today he got me pretty good, it was cold-blooded, but still good.\n\nAbout a week ago, my coworkers and I had a company outing. A few of us stayed out pretty late and we ended up back at my place. Of course I had to bring the Mary J out. What better time than with coworkers, right? Everyone partook and all was well. Over the following weekend, the HR Director found out about the \"activities\" that night, from one of the guys that had joined us. We are all really good friends and everyone is cool with the topic of Mary J, but the HR Director still felt compelled to mess with me.\n\nI'm sitting in a meeting when I get an email from the HR Director saying \"Come see me when you can, no rush.\" Again, we are really good friends, so I didn't give it much thought. I walk in and he pauses momentarily, giving off the vibe that we needed to have a serious chat. \"So one of our new clients, (*****), requires us to do some initial random drug tests. You know...because the information we deal with is very sensitive, they are asking us to do this upfront and it looks like you're my guy for this today. Go ahead and sign the form and we can take care of this over lunch.\" Let it be known that the HR Director's past job for about 10 years, was being a police officer. When the guy addresses you in a serious manner, you listen. \n\nI immediately go white. All of the color drains out of me as if I had just seen a ghost. I start getting shaky as I lean over the drug screening release form to sign it. My HR Director looks me over and says \"you're good to go right? You're my guy for this, right?\" I have no clue what to say, except to not blatantly say \"no\". I begin to stall with \"uhhh uhhhhhhh ummm\". At this point I'm planning some sort of exit strategy. Should I fake sick and just leave for the day? Should I just run out whilst screaming \"you'll never take me alive?!?!\" \n\nI'm standing there breathless and speechless, then I see him start to smile. He says \"I'm jk man, there's no test hahaha.\" Then I had one of those moments where you want to smack the shit out of and kiss the other person all at the same time. I was relieved to know that it was all a hoax, but damn if it didn't shake me up for the next few hours. It was a pretty sobering experience, sort of like nearly missing a DUI arrest.

The other 30% of the time, such as at work, we have some tough decisions to make. This document is intended to help you in those decisions.\n\nHolders - The obvious choice is just plain holding it in. A popular choice among the females and an almost impossible choice for males. I am not in favor of holding, as I believe the medical community has not done enough research about the long-term damage of holding. Really, where does it go if you hold it in? So be forewarned, using this tactic is to be done at your own risk.\n\nDesk Jockey - When deciding to release right at your desk, one has many factors to consider: \n- Do you have your own office? Feel free to fart at will risk free. After commencing, I highly recommend locking the door and feigning you are not in the office to avoid any unwanted visitors. \nI also highly recommend against spraying air freshener, as the smell of the freshener is a dead giveaway. Candles are a good alternative solution for the females.\n- Are you seated at a cubicle or open desk? If so, one has to consider the proximity of the other workers and the density of workers in the area. \nIf it is just you and one other person in the area, there is nowhere to place the blame. If others are fairly distant to you, the smell will dissipate by the time it reaches the others on all but the most egregious of days. There is always the chance of dispensing at higher decibels than anticipated due to the highly unstable nature of farts. In these most unfortunate situations, you will have to use cover up sounds such as scraping your heal on the floor. I recommend practicing making sounds covering a wide range of tones and pitches in anticipation of such an event. Dropping objects such as staplers, binders and tape may not produce a similar sound, but if done in rapid succession could distract others from the initial event.\n\nMeetings: - Sometimes the urge strikes at the most inopportune time.\nMeetings and gas really do not mix. \nReleasing at a meeting is by far the trickiest of all the situations one could find oneself in.\nAlthough I am against holding in general, a meeting may be the time for it.\nIt really depends if you have established baseline farts before the meeting.\nThis will give you a sense of the decibel and scent level of what is to be expected. \nWarning: Do not ever use a meeting as the place to establish a baseline.\nOf course none of the above applies if you are meeting with vendors. \nYou have free reign to do whatever you like.\n\nAisle Walker: - Releasing while walking around the office is a popular option.\nBy the time the scent disseminates, you should be nowhere near the scene of the incident.\nThe added benefit is that if the release is done at higher decibels than anticipated, you can break out into an all out sprint thereby fleeing the scene before others even look up to notice.\n\nBroom Closet: - One option is to find a broom closet and release inside the closet.\nThe only drawback is explaining why you were in the broom closet if you are caught entering or leaving the closet.\nI found stashing stationery supplies in the closet provides a nice excuse. \nPeople will love you for informing them about the backup stationery supply cabinet.\nOf course, you then have to find another closet, as your original place will become too risky.\n\nAnd remember, if you're workplace has many open flames, you are on your own.",

Immediately, Johnny (who was well-known for his use of foul language) raised his hand, with a mischievous smirk.  \u201cOf course, I know he\u2019ll say \u2018asshole\u2019,\u201d thought Miss Lippy.  \u201cI\u2019ll call on Jane.\u201d Jane, being the polite, intelligent student that she was, answered \u201cApple!\u201d  \u201cWell Done! Now, who can give me a word that begins with the letter \u2018B\u2019?\u201d Miss Lippy asked.

He took the sex addict to a room filled with all sorts of women, men and and sex toys that the sex addict could imagine. The doctor told the sex addict that he would check on him in 3 weeks to see how he was doing. Then closed and locked the door. He then took the alcoholic to his room which was filled with every liquor, beer and wine that the alcoholic could drink. The doctor told him the same thing as the sex addict, that he will check on him in three weeks and see how he was doing. Then the doctor closed and locked the door. Then the doctor took the stoner to his room which was filled with every strain of weed imaginable and every kind of piece to smoke out of. The doctor told him he will be back in three weeks to check on him. Then closed and locked the door. The three weeks had passed and it was time for the doctor to check on his patients. He goes to the sex addict's room first, opens the door and finds the guy dead. He had fucked himself to death. The doctor sighs and moves onto the alcoholic's room. The doctor opens the door and finds the alcoholic dead. He had drank himself to death. The doctor, now frustrated, walks down to the stoner's room. Not expecting anything good, the doctor opens the door and sees the stoner in a fetal position, crying in the corner. The doctor asks what's wrong? The stoner peaks up and goes \"DOC!!! Tell me you have a lighter!\"",

Just before unmasking at midnight she slipped away, went home, put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of explanation he would make up for his outrageous behavior.\n\nShe was sitting up reading when he came in, so she asked what kind of time he had. \"Oh, the same old thing. You know I never have a good time when you're not there.\" \n\nThen she asked, \"Did you dance much?\"\n\nHe replied, \"I'll tell you, I never even danced one dance.

His mother, while supporting his hobby, was warned by his pediatrician: \u201cBilly practicing on the organ has prevented him from spending any time outside. It seems as if he is not receiving the appropriate amount of exercise recommended at his age.\u201d His mother ignored his doctor for years, assured that Billy\u2019s hobby was perfectly safe. Billy did not have many friends due to his obsession with the organ. He didn\u2019t care; he loved the organ. He performed his own composition at a local church and received a standing ovation. There he met the love of his life at this church, and they started dating. However, they promptly broke up when she couldn\u2019t support his obsession with the organ, calling his lifestyle too \u201corganic.\u201d When Billy grew to be 15 years old, he heard of this orchestra from his town that needed an organist, but it was really hard to get accepted into. This only made Billy want to practice and practice more. Finally, the day for his audition came. He went to the audition room and started to play, but no sound would come out of the organ. The organ was broken. The judge, a middle aged man named Mr. Harley, immediately arranged for Billy to play on another organ. As Billy began to play, the organ also creaked and then ceased to make a sound. Mr. Harley arranged for yet another organ for Billy, but that one broke down as well. Before Mr. Harley could ask for one more organ, he suddenly collapsed to the ground. Later, at the hospital, the doctors pronounced Mr. Harley dead and performed an autopsy. \"The cause of death appears to be multiple organ failure.\"\n",

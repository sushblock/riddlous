        "body": "It was the time of the Great War. A striking, beautiful german was captured by the Allied powers, and after a short trial (only 5 minutes long) she was condemned to die, by firing squad.\n\nA squadron of french soldiers was given the task. The time has come. The Gaul captain prepared to give the order: MAKE READY!...TAKE AIM!...but before he could have uttered FIRE!, the teutonic beauty opened her mink coat that covered her perfect body and presented herself naked to all the soldiers present.\n\nAt the uncertain light of dawn, the figure of the most beautiful lady appeared to be more an alabaster statue than human flesh, her supple limbs, her perfect pair of breasts, marmol chalices so that you were able to drink in them the sweet love nectar, her...(Redaction note: our collaborator keeps describing the body and face of the captured spy for 6 more pages, so we were forced to redact it for brevity\u00b4s sake).\n\nSeeing the striking image of the woman, the french soldiers, romantics like every Frenchman, refused to shoot at her. One of them declared: \"Beaute porte sa bourse\". Beauty carries its dower in its face, I would shoot my own wife before the demoiselle.\n\nSeeing the failure of the soldiers of France, a second squad was called, this one composed of British. It was thought that the traditional British poise, along with the customs that ruled in Her Majesty army, would prevent them to fall in the seduction of that provocative woman.\n\nThose who thought that were wrong: a second time, at the crucial time, the spy revealed her naked body beneath the garments and the British soldiers lowered their weapons upon seeing such beauty.\n\nThe judges were alarmed. Would they have to do the dirty deed? they havent even killed a rabbit in their lifetime. The oldest of the judges had a moment of insight: In Paris there was a group of Mexican Revolucionarios, in a goodwill mission. Perhaps they could take over the firing squad, if they greased their palms enough.\n\nThe Mexican squad was called and the idea was proposed. They responded that they were unable to take any money, for national pride, but if there was a large enough feast with champagne and some muchachas they would be willing to finish the job, the French accepted that deal, and the spy was taken again in front of the bloody wall. The Mexican Sargento yelled \"PREPAREN!\"....the Mexican soldiers readied their weapons....\"APUNTEN!\" seven rifles were pointed to the unlucky lady...and as always, the spy shook off her clothes...\n\nThere was a loud boom, and she fell to the floor, lifeless.\n\nEveryone was surprised, not single soldier had shot his weapon, and yet the woman didnt even suffered the coup of grace.\n\nthe next day, the autopsy revealed: \"Tama riha, the spy, died after receiving the impact of seven pant buttons at high velocity to the chest\".\n\nPardon my English.",

He uses his laptop to search for references. He taps into the air-phone with his modem and searches the Net and the library of Congress. Frustrated, he sends emails to his coworkers and friends. No luck. After an hour, he gives up.\n\nHe wakes the blonde and hands her $500 the blonde politely takes the $500 and turns away to get back to sleep. The lawyer, who is going nuts trying to figure it out, wakes the blonde and asks, \"Well, so what goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four?\" The blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5, and goes back to sleep.\n",

The story goes a gentleman (our main character) picks up a few rounds of golf with some of the guys at the office once a week after work. On this particular evening a few rounds turned into a few more, and a few more, and (as most games do) a few more. Looking at the time, our protagonist has a sudden shock, he's late, beyond late. His wife will certainly break and burn his clubs after this one. So he makes like a tree and leaves.\n\nIt's beginning to pour rain as he's driving home, and on the side of the road he spot a damsel with her car broken down. He pulls over offers help, she asks for a ride home and so she can leave her car till after the rain calms down.\n\nHaving arrived at her house, she ask if he can come in to make sure everything is safe. He's really late to get home to his wife but she persists and he folds. After going in she offers him a drink to repay him for the ride, he insists that he must head home to his wife, she persists and he folds. There's no debate as the two begin embracing each other, tearing at each others clothes they enjoy the company of each other (to say the least). Now fast forward.\n\nHe's beyond late at this point, he's cheated on his wife, he doesn't know what he could possibly say to his wife to fix this. He decides he can't lie, he has to be honest with her. Walking into his house he finds the living room light on, his wife sitting in the arm chair, red in the face with fury as she's waiting to hear what he has to say. He comes clean, he explains the girl on the side of the road, explains that what he thought was a good deed became sour real quickly. His plea for forgiveness silences as he looks to her for a response, for a moment all is quiet. Suddenly she speaks... \"Bullshit you played another few rounds of golf didn't you?\"",

It's practically indestructible and has withstood all the barfights, shootings and stabbings.  When things get rough - and they *will get rough*, I just want you to hunker down behind the bar, stay safe and don't worry about any messes, I'll take care of everything.\"\n\nThe man agrees and is excited about getting started.\n\nThen the owner remembers one last thing.  \n\n\"One more thing, \", he says, \" if you ever hear someone say 'Big John is coming', you just get out of town as fast as you can, don't stick around, don't waste any time, just get out and get out fast!\"\n\nThat seemed a little over cautious to the man but he agreed.\n\nSo weeks and months go by with the man doing a great job mixing drinks, talking to people and staying safe through all the shootings and stabbings.  He's got his routine down pat.\n\nThen one night he hears someone yell, \"Big John's coming!\".\n\nThe man stops and thinks, trying to remember what he was supposed to do, and by the time he looks up, the bar is cleared out, nobody in sight.\n\nThe man goes to leave the bar, but he sees a **Gigantic** man heading right toward the bar.  The man is shirtless and muscular, riding a mountain lion and swinging a rattlesnake above his head.\n\nTerrified, the man runs back into the bar and hunkers down behind the oak bar.\n\nIn bursts the big man, knocking the saloon doors off their hinges.  Gigantic booming footsteps shake the floor as he approaches the bar.  He peers over the bar and shouts at the bartender, \"WHISKEY!\"\n\nShaking, the bartender finds a bottle of whiskey and nervously pours a shot for the big man.\n\nThe big man drinks the shot and slams the glass back down on the oak bar, and a crack starts to form in the bar.  \n\n\"THE BOTTLE!!\" shouts the big man, and the bartender hands it to him timidly.\" \n\nThe big man snatches the bottle, bites the neck off of it and swallows the glass, then drinks the entire bottle down and when he slammed the bottle on the bar it splinters into a million pieces leaving the bartender exposed.  \n\nHe looks up at the big man and manages to stutter out, \"C-Can I get you an- anything else...sir?\"\n\nThe big man replied, \"NO!

Once completely nude, they both get on the floor and start giving each other footjobs.\nWhile this is happening, the mother and the daughter just go to town on each other. They shove each other\u2019s tongues down their throats and start stripping as well. They also get on the floor, but they start 69\u2019ing each other.\n\nThe father and the son up their footjob game, and go at such a speed that both their feet and their penises are mere blurs. Once they accomplish this, the son loosens his butthole and expels a nine-inch dildo out of his ass with such force that it gets partially lodged into his father\u2019s asshole.\n\n\u201cDangnabbit, boy\u201d says the father. He takes the dildo out of his own ass and loosens his own anal sphincter \u2013 afterwards, he farts out two belts.\n\nThe father and the son then both slide towards the dildo until it\u2019s evenly lodged up both their asses and their balls touch. All the while, they\u2019re still giving each other furious footjobs. They then take the belts and tighten them around each other\u2019s throats, until both of them can barely breathe. All the while, they\u2019re shitting extreme diarrhea onto the dildo and moving it back and forth between them.\nThe mother and daughter, on the other hand, are upping their 69\u2019ing game. They start biting down hard on each other\u2019s pussies, and moving their mouths up and down and left and right while exerting a considerable amount of pressure on each other\u2019s vaginas. Naturally, they draw blood. The blood from their vaginas starts filling up the other\u2019s mouth, and they get to work on expanding the other person\u2019s buttholes. \n\nThey start with one finger and decide to cut out the middlemen, and just start shoving both fists into each other\u2019s butts until they make them the size of baseballs.\n\nThe father and the son get super hard from all their experienced pleasure, and start pissing. The piss streams rise, then fall into each other\u2019s mouths. Then, they ejaculate. The cum from their penises land on each other\u2019s forehead and noses. They quickly remove the shit-covered dildo and the cum-and-piss covered belts from their bodies, and rush over to the ladies.\n\nThe mother and the daughter are done expanding each other\u2019s assholes, and get up to meet the father and the son. They pour the pussy blood from their mouths onto the faces of the father and the son \u2013 the mother gives her daughter\u2019s blood to the father, and the daughter does likewise to the son. The mother and the daughter then  get on their heads, with their gaping assholes facing up into the air and having their arms and each other\u2019s bodies supporting one another. The father and the son use the belts to tie the two together, to further support them.\n\nThe father and the son then scoop the cum from their faces into their mouths, and pour the collective accumulation of blood, piss, and cum into both the mother and the daughter\u2019s gaping assholes. The father pours his collection into the mother, and the brother does likewise to the daughter. They then take the diarrhea-covered dildo and proceed to mix the contents of the event using the females\u2019 assholes as the bowls and the shit-covered dildo as a stirrer. Once they\u2019re done, they shove the dildo into the mother and daughter\u2019s mouths and force the girls to deepthroat it. The father and the son then take out a straw from both the mother and the daughter, and proceed to drink the concoction out from their respective female\u2019s asshole, all the while singing \u201cyummy, yummy, choc\u2019ly milk!\u201d over and over again.\n\nThe talent agent, shocked, just sits there for a few minutes. Finally, he\u2019s regained his composure and is able to speak again. \u201cMy, that\u2019s really something you've got there. What do you call it?\u201d\n\nThe father and son stop singing and drinking, look into the agent\u2019s eyes, and say: \u201cThe Aristocrats!\u201d \n",

Being the nice neighbor I was, I go up to her to ask if she needs help moving in. I'm nervous, because on the best of days, I'm like a six. So I go up to her, and she's like \"Ummm, no thanks\" in the RUDEST voice you could think of. I'm like, OK, I go home, not really dissapointed, as I knew I had no chance. So, the day after, I see her dog on my lawn. I was annoyed, as it would mess up some of my vegetables I was growing. So, I approach the dog, and luckily, he doesn't growl. I pick up an old leash I had when I was young, and attach it to him. I bring him over to the girls house, and knock. When she opens the door, she immediately sees her dog. She screams \"On my god! Corki! I was looking every where for you! Thank you so much for bringing him back! I'm sorry I was so rude yesterday, I was just having a bad day. Tell you what, to make up for it, why don't I take you to a meal, as a thank you, and a sorry.\" \"Suuurrrreeee....\" I respond, surprised how this day is turning out. So we go to lunch, and one thing leads to another, and we're eventually calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend. A couple months later, another girl moves in. She's cute, but not the best. I'd say a solid 7. So, I offer her some help. Moving in, and she thanks me profusely. After moving g a couple boxes, I see some that are full of video game stuff. I ask \" Are these your boyfriends?\" \"No, they're mine\" she responds. I'm surprised, as you don't often see girl gamers. Especially this hardcore. So, we hang out, as we have similar interests. I'm talking to my girl one night, after playing some Diablo III with the other girl, and she says that she's jealous. I'm like, what???? What world are you living in for a nine like you to be jealous about some one like me??? But, I dont say that. I say \"Look, we're both very similar, and if you like me, I'm sure you'd like her, so just talk to her, and maybe we can all hang out.\" So she goes, and when she comes back, she looks traumatized. \"Okay, you are never talking to that girl AGAIN. As soon as I walked in, she started screaming, and saying how your hers, and threatened to kill me.\" \"What?\" I reply \"There's no way that's her, look, I'll talk to her in the morning Okay?\" So we say our good nights, and I go home.I wake up, and knock on her door, she doesn't answer. So I go to my girls house, and she doesn't answer either. This continues for a couple days. One day, while watching the news, I see the 7 girl, in handcuffs. The news reporter goes on to say how she murdered someone. She shows the image, and that girl, is my girlfriend, and it looks like, there are chunks of her missing, like someone ate her. I start freaking out, and the news show goes back to her \" She's dead, you're next. She's dead, you're next\" and she keeps repeating that to the camera. I quickly turn it off, as her lines repeat over and over. She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next. SHE'S DEAD, YOU'RE NEXT. SHE'S DEAD, YOU'RE NEXT! Its screaming in my brain, and the only thing I could think of was, Why was six afraid of seven?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause seven ate nine",

        "body": "Yuri had lived in Russia all of his life, in a small town near Moscow. The town had horrible weather conditions almost all of the time and very few people lived there. Everyone living in the town was struggling to survive in such poor conditions. Yuri had lived alone in a small house in this town. He worked every day at a factory that was close to this town. It was hard work, and Yuri was never very happy with his work, but he kept enduring the rough conditions to be able to have an income. Yuri's life had been like this for several years, and he had endured many hardships during these times.\n\nEvery day, while Yuri was taking his walk to the factory before work began, he always passed by a large billboard on the side of the road. The billboard changed every month or so, usually showing an irrelevant advertisement for something that Yuri had little interest in. Today, however, Yuri noticed a new advertisement on the billboard. It read, \"SWIMMING LESSONS\" in large letters, accompanied by a picture of a large man swimming through the water. This ad had given Yuri something to be interested in. He had always had an intense passion for swimming, but it was always too difficult to practice in the frigid waters of the lake near his home. Yuri continued to read the ad before he finally came to the price: 5000 Rubles base fee.\n\nYuri was sad, because this was much more than Yuri could afford to spend. However, he thought to himself, \"If I could save up enough money from the factory work, then by the end of the month, I should have enough...\" After this, he decided that day that he would work as hard as he could to make sure he had enough money by the end of the month. He even had to cut back his food supply by just a small amount to still have enough money. Finally, at the end of the month, Yuri finally had enough money to be able to go to the swimming pool not far from his home where the practices were being held.\n\nEvery day after his hard work at the factory, he greatly enjoyed going back to the pool and practicing his swimming. He had started quickly and advanced rapidly. Everyone who frequented the pool to practice their swimming was impressed by Yuri's natural ability to be able to learn and adapt so quickly, becoming very popular with the people at the pool, his hometown, and even in Moscow. It was truly a passion of Yuri's.\n\nA few months had passed, and Yuri's amazing swimming abilities had been noticed by people in places all across Russia, considering a swimming prodigy. Yuri was always modest about his skills, but was humble nonetheless. However, he still had to continue his work at the factory, and live in the same small house he had lived in since he was born. For him, swimming was the one thing that saved him from the cruel and harsh life he lived.\n\nLater that month, on his way to the factory once again, he had noticed that the billboard he so often passed had changed once again. While it was difficult to read in the unrelenting snowstorm, he managed to make out the words \"DIVING PRACTICES\" in big letters. Diving was something that Yuri had also found to be interesting, but could never find the time nor place to practice properly. The pool he went to had no diving boards or excessively deep sections of the pool, so it was hard for Yuri to practice diving. However, this would give him another opportunity to pursue what he wanted to do. He looked down at the bottom of the billboard and saw something that, like the other ad, made his heart drop. The base fee was 7500 Rubles.\n\nYuri knew that it would take another month or two of hard work at the factory to be able to achieve such a high sum of money. The factory was beginning to offer less and less money to Yuri, making life harder on him than it was before. He had to cut back his food money as well to accommodate for this. However, Yuri overcame the hardships in his life and save up just enough money by the end of two months.\n\nThe practices were held at another pool not far from the one he already went to, so it was easy for him to practice both swimming and diving at once. He continued to master his swimming skills while also learning how to practice diving. Much like with swimming, however, he had picked up skills quickly, and it only took him another few months before he had mastered diving.\n\nMany people had heard of Yuri at this point. Several news stories across Russia were focused around Yuri, who was considered to be the best swimmer and diver in the whole country. He continued to remain incredibly modest through all of his interviews. \"It is only something I am fond of, a hobby\" Yuri would say. \"I still have a life in the factory that I must attend to every day. It is a hard life, so swimming and diving are what I use to keep myself healthy.\" Despite his fame and popularity, Yuri did continue to work at the factory day in and day out, receiving little pay and little food for all of his hard work. Despite all of Yuri's hardships, he continued his daily routine of working, swimming, and diving.\n\nFor yet another time, Yuri was on his way to the factory. The billboard had changed once again. Yuri anticipated something exciting on the billboard, and he was not disappointed at what he saw. \"TRAVEL TO AMERICA TODAY!\" read the ad. Yuri was very interested. He had always heard of America, and had heard nothing but positive things about it. The land of the free! It was a very exciting idea to Yuri. However, he knew that with ads like these, he knew they would come at a steep price. Unfortunately, he thought correctly. The boats that traveled to America were advertised as costing 60,000 Rubles.\n\nYuri knew that that kind of sum would come from only another year or so of hard work at the factory. The factory work had become increasingly more difficult every single day, with little pay, food, and free time. However, he endured the next year the same way he endured the previous years: with swimming and diving. It truly was his passion, and Yuri was not sure on how he would have survived without them.\n\nFinally, the year had passed, and Yuri had finally saved up enough Rubles to be able to ride the boat to America. He climbed aboard the boat with all of his possessions with him, all managing to fit in one small suitcase. The boat was somewhat small in size, being able to house only around 20 or so people. The boat set sail across the cold waters of the ocean. About a day had passed when people had finally recognized Yuri, the famed Russian swimmer and diver. They were all very excited to meet Yuri, and had several questions to ask him about his swimming skills. \"It is nothing much, just a passion of mine, that is all. It is something I use to endure the hardships and trials of my life...\" Yuri would always respond to his fans.\n\nOne day the boat had to make a stop at a small island to fill up the boat's gas supply, for they had much less than they had expected to have. It was a nice, sunny day outside, and the water was said to be very warm. One of the passengers asked Yuri to show off some of his diving techniques to his fans, since they had time to kill before the boat would depart again. \"Hey, Yuri! While we wait, could you show us some of your diving skills? I would LOVE to see them!\" Yuri was hesitant at first. Another passenger asked, \"And maybe once you have done that, could you show us your swimming techniques? The water is warm, and it would make my day to see them!\" Yuri replied, \"Well... ok, if you all insist I do it.\"\n\nYuri looked off the side of the boat. On the bottom of the boat, a balcony extended from the bottom. Yuri feared he might hit the balcony on his dive down, but everyone else assured Yuri that he wouldn't hit it in a million years. Yuri stepped up over the railing, onto the side of the boat. With the same skill that he had used so many times before, he demonstrated his graceful diving skills by performing his favorite dive he knew. His fans watched in amazement as his body twirled through the air beautifully, showing the same amount of skill he put into each of his other dives. As he dove down towards the war waters below, people watched and expected for Yuri to land smoothly in the water.\n\nUnfortunately, Yuri never landed in the water. He landed instead on the solid, hard deck of the boat's balcony below. The impact sounded painful, and all of the spectators winced on pain over his fall. Yuri remained motionless for several seconds, and his fans began to worry. Many people were about to call for medics when Yuri managed to get up slowly. \"Are you alright Yuri? That fall looked hard! That must have broken some bones!\" Yuri, however, had barely an injury. As he had gotten up, he simply regained his sense of direction. This had amazed several people, as that kind of a fall would have surely broken any other person's bones, if not killed them. Instead, Yuri simply stood up with barely a scratch, and waved back at the row of spectators.\n\n\"It is OK, everybody\" Yuri yelled back. \"I have endured many hardships in my life.\"",

I'll have a double scotch\" the man says.\n\nThe ostrich says, \"I'll have a double scotch\".\n\nThe cat says, \"I'll have a double scotch, but I'm not paying!\"\n\nThe barkeep says, \"Sure. Your total comes to nine pounds sixty\", so the bloke reaches into his pocket, pulls out exactly nine pounds sixty, and gives it to the barkeep, who can no longer hold in his curiosity.\n\n\"Say, mate\", says the barkeep, \"I've noticed that whenever you need to pay, you can just reach into your pocket and pull out exact change. How is that?\"\n\nThe man replies, \"Ah, good observation. Well, a few weeks ago, I was rubbing a lamp, and a genie appeared. He said he would grant three of my wishes, so I came up with three wishes. My first wish was that any time I need money, no matter what for, that I can just reach into my pocket and pull out the necessary amount\".\n\n\"Ah, smart\", replies the barkeep, \"Most blokes would have just asked for a pile of money, but this time, you've got it infinitely\".\n\n\"Exactly\".\n\n\"But, um, I have another question. What's with the, um, what's with the ostrich and the cat.

Me 'n me crew, we're sailin' off the shore of Montego Bay with a hull full o' fresh Jamaican slaves when a heavily armed merchant vessel comes right up to our starboard side, tellin' us that we've gotta let go of our cargo 'cause we've got their employer in there.

But we showed 'em, we did. They took me leg, but I'm an honest man, ye see, I don't go back on me word. So we sent 'em right down to 'ol Davy.\"\n\n\"Masterful work, captain!\" the barkeep applauds. However, he quickly goes quiet again, his eyes moving from the peg leg to...\n\n\"But captain,\" he says, \"What happened to yer hand?\"\n\nThe pirate looks down at the hook curving from his severed wrist and shakes his head in memory. \"Aye,\" he replies solemnly, \"That's a story, that is. Me 'n me crew, we were sailing 'cross the Moru Passage when another crew, one of 'em bastard Welsh sons o' sea-cucumbers that dare call 'emselves buccaneers, and they go on demandin' our booty.

He knows however, that Chancellor Bismarck will strike no easy bargain and will demand steep cessions from the French.  Thinking frantically as the peace talks approach, Napoleon finally comes up wth an idea.  He sends a telegram to Bismarck stating that in the interest of mutual friendship between the two nations, he will grant Prussia\u2019s ambassador any request of French territory desired, but only the first request and no others.  \n\nBismarck is ecstatic, knowing that he has truly struck a master blow and gained glory for Prussia for generations to come.  He dispatches a young ambassador to Paris with instructions to request all of Burgundy, Dijon, and Normandy for Prussian annexation.  \n\nThe ambassador arrives in Paris and treats with the French delegation, and is about to make the formal Prussian request when Napoleon interrupts him.  \u201cMy friend,\u201d he says.  \u201cI can tell that you are earnest and talented, and I believe that Herr Bismarck may indeed intend for you to be his successor upon his death.  In the interest of the future of relations between our nations I will give you a most wonderful gift, but you must take it or leave it before you make Bismarck\u2019s request.  Afterwards I cannot grant it.  There lives a woman in a small village here in France, a most beautiful woman with breasts so ample and soft that men forget their names upon seeing them, a smile so charming it makes men\u2019s hearts sing, and the ability to give pleasure in a way to make men scream in ecstasy.  I had the fortune of lying with her for a day and I tell you, the experience is the height of human pleasure. If you are a worthy man I will take you to her.\u201d \n\nThe young ambassador is torn between doing Bismarck\u2019s bidding immediately and the prospect of such immense pleasure, but since Napoleon had assured the Chancellor that any request would be granted, he figures he has nothing to lose and accepts Napoleon\u2019s offer.  \n\n\u201cA good choice my friend,\u201d continues Napoleon.  \u201cLike I told you this woman is beautiful, with ample breasts and an alluring smile, and the ability to pleasure a man in such a way to make him scream like the harpy in ecstasy.  Truly she is the pride of all France.  As Emperor I cannot simply allow an unworthy man to be with her.  But prove your worth and I shall take you to her, I promise you this.  At the top of Mont Blanc there is a man named Alphonse, who was one of my officers and who also had the pleasure of knowing this girl.  After being with her he knew that he would experience no greater pleasure in his lifetime, and so became an ascetic hermit atop the highest mountain.  If you are worthy then go to him, tell him I sent you, and ask him the name of this woman, the jewel of France with breasts so ample and soft that men forget their names upon seeing them, a smile so charming it makes men\u2019s hearts sing, and the ability to give pleasure in such a way to make men scream in ecstasy and give up worldly existence.  Ask this of Alphonse and bring me his answer, and I will bring you to her.\u201d \n\nThe young ambassador rushes out of the Elysee Palace, to climb Mont Blanc and learn the name of this incredible woman.  Days go by, then weeks.  Napoleon begins to fear that he sent the young Prussian to his grave.  Finally nearly a month later, the young ambassador stumbles back into the Palace, bedraggled and frostbitten.  Panting to catch his breath, the young man is finally able to summon the strength to give his answer to Napoleon and the French.   \n\n\u201cAl Says Lorraine.\u201d  ",

Then, he explores more of Jimi Hendrix's discography and soon enough he's a full on Jimi Hendrix fan.\n\nAfter some time of being a Hendrix fan, the horse is inspired to be a guitarist. He gets all the money he has and buys a low-end used Stratocaster.\n\nHe begins to learn how to play, and quickly enough, he knows how to play every Jimi Hendrix song. He can play every riff flawlessly.\n\nThen the horse decides, \"This isn't enough\". He wants to start a band. He had heard about this chicken who is an absolute beast at bass. So he finds the chicken and he asks him to join him. The chicken, who has a deep passion for music, accepts gladly. The chicken begins to listen to Jimi Hendrix, and soon enough, he can play the bass of every song perfectly.\n\nBut the two needed more band members. There is an older cow on the farm who used to play drums. They ask him, \"Would you like to join our band?\" But the cow seemed sad. The cow said, \"I would love to, but I sold my drums some time ago.\" The horse and chicken decide to buy a drum set for the cow. After they presented him with the drum set, the cow jumped with joy. Nostalgia running through his veins, he gets on the drums and rips it. The rumors were true; the cow was a legendary drummer. Flattered by the horse and chicken's efforts, the cow couldn't help but join the band. The cow began to listen to Jimi Hendrix, and could play every one of his songs in no time.\n\nNow they have three amazing musicians, but something was missing: vocals. None of them could sing. The chicken then remembers a pig from college who used to be in music class with him. After much searching, they found the pig's whereabouts; it was a farm only 10 miles north! They travel to the other farm and find the pig. He is working on the field in his farm. They ask him, \"We're starting a band, but none of us can sing. Would you like to join us?\" The pig looks at the ground under him, and then at his dirty hooves. He tells them, \"Since I was a boy, my dream had always been to have a career in music. How I ended up here, I don't know. I'll join, because a career in music is my dream. No matter the risks, I'm on board.\" And so, the pig joined, and listened to Jimi Hendrix, and learned every lyric to every Jimi Hendrix song.\n\nThus started the beginning of the Barnyard Bros. At first, they were just a Jimi Hendrix cover band. They received a nice, modest following of fans. They could emulate the Jimi Hendrix Experience flawlessly. The resemblance was uncanny. They were started to get the ball rolling.\n\nThen the horse, the one who started it all, said again, \"This isn't enough\". They decided that if they were going to be big, it had to be their own music they were playing. They started to write their own music, and eventually recorded their first studio album. And everyone loved it. Their fan base was growing faster then they could ever imagine. Their album has sold over a million copies. Number 1 on iTunes. Number 1 on Google Play. Number 1 played album on Spotify. They were everywhere. They were the most popular band in the world.\n\nThe horse's old farmer gets a call. It's from Jimmy Kimmel's manager. Kimmel wants them on the show. The farmer calls up the horse and tells him of this opportunity. The horse is ecstatic. He and his band get to be on TV! What the horse did not know is that his farmer is a huge Jimmy Kimmel fan. It's been his dream to attend the show, but he hasn't had the finances to do so. He asks the horse, \"Please, can you find it in your heart to take me?\" The horse loved his farmer very much. His farmer was the one who gave him his job. Had it not been for that job, he would have never got that guitar, never started a band, and never would have been in the position he was in. The horse then agrees to take the farmer to see Jimmy Kimmel, and decides to give a little more. An all expenses paid, week long trip to LA, so the farmer can enjoy the city after he goes to the show.\n\nThe horse flies to LA a week before the rest to finalize the deal. He meets with Kimmel and his manager and sings the deal. It's official; the Barnyard Bros will be on the Jimmy Kimmel show.\n\nThe rest of the band and the farmer get on their flight to LA. But tragedy strikes. An engine fails. The plane is losing stability, but can still fly. In a few minutes, the other engine begins failing. The plane begins to plummet. The plane nose dives into the ground and crashes. There are no survivors. Everyone, the chicken, the cow, the pig, and the farmer, gone.\n\nThe horse hears about the news, and begins to break down in tears. \"This is my fault.\" he said to himself. The horse blamed himself for their deaths because he had started this band. They wouldn't be on that plane if he hadn't had the stupid idea to get the band together and go on the Kimmel show. He cancelled his appointment to be on the Jimmy Kimmel Show, as the Barnyard Bros were no more.\n\nThe horse, seeing as his friends were no longer alive, decides that he doesn't deserve to live either. He buys a bottle of oxycodone. His idea is to just overdose and end his life. He goes to a bar in LA and asks for the drink with the most alcohol. The bartender looks at the horse. The horse is visibly upset. Now the bartender is a nice guy. He doesn't like seeing people in a bad mood and always does his best to help.\n\nSo the bartender approaches the horse, and asks him, \"Hey, why the long face?\"",

I forgot my keys\" the kid is surprised by this word and asks for its meaning the father replies \"uhhh, it means doormat, Yeah! Doormat like this one.\" He pointed at the Doormat next to their house's entrance, afterwards the father got his keys and they were on the road.\n\nWhile they were driving the father drove faster than the speed limit by a few kph, he hears sirens, looks behind and sees a Cop telling him to pull over. The man tries to reason with the Cop, but he's not having none of it and gives him a ticket. The father mutters \"Bastard!\" Under his breath, and the son promptly asks what that word means the father thinks up something quickly, and nervously replies \"It uhh, means Police officer..\" \n\nAfter the kid had gotten his haircut, and is driven home by his father, he goes to see what his mom's cooking in the kitchen.\n\nHe walks into his mother cutting some chicken breasts, and surprised her by yelling out \"Hi mom!\" She jumps up and cuts her finger while shouting \"Oh F*ck\" multiple times, and as usual the kid asks what that word means, his mother says \"It means cutting, Yeah cutting...\" the kid gladly takes that answer and leaves his mother, because she seems busy bleeding out...\n\nHe sees his dad start to shave his beard, and he seems really focused on the task at hand. So naturally, the kid screams \"Hi Dad!\" As loud as he could, causing his father to ruin his perfect goatee. The father engulfed with anguish says \"Oh balls! It's ruined.\" The kid asks what that means, and his father let's out a sigh, probably asking himself why he's doing this in the first place, he responds \"Ohh, balls? It means beard..\" the son is sorta unsure about it, but takes it as middle aged man slang...\n\nWhile both parents are busy with their predicaments, someone knocks on their door. The kid answers and it's the Cop from earlier, so he proceeded to greet him, \"Hey, bastard! Wipe you feet on shit.\"\nThe Cop is taken back by this but decides to just ignore the kid, since he probably doesn't know what he's talking about. He asks \"Hey kid, are any of your parents here?\" The kid replies \"Yeah, my mom is f*cking the chicken, and my father is shaving his balls...\"",

Every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator. Last weekend only eight of the 12 eggs hatched.\"\nAgain, the teacher asked for the moral of the story.\nLucy replied, \"Don't count your chickens before they hatch.\"\nNext up was little Johnny. \"My uncle Ted fought in the Vietnam war, and his plane was shot down over enemy territory. He jumped out before it crashed but could only take a case of beer, a machine gun and a machete. On the way down, he drank the case of beer. Then he landed right in the middle of 100 Vietnamese soldiers. He shot 70 with his machine gun, but then he ran out of bullets! So he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more. Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.\"\nThe teacher looked a little shocked. After clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story.\n\"Well,\" Johnny replied, \"Don't f**k with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking.\"",

As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.\n\nThe vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.\n\nThe vet looked at the woman and said, \"I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.\"\n\nThe vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..\n\nThe duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. \"$150!\" she cried, \"$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!\"\n\nThe vet shrugged, \"I'm sorry.

I wish to marry a guy with 100 crore annual salary or above.\n\nYou might say that I'm greedy, but an annual salary 2 crore is considered only as middle class now days..\n\nMy requirement is not high. Is there anyone in this forum who has an income of 100 crore annual salary? Are you all married?\n\nI wanted to ask: what should I do to marry rich persons like you?\n\nAmong those I've dated, the richest is 50 crore annual income, and it seems that this is my upper limit.\n\nIf someone is going to move into high cost residential area on the west of New York City Garden(?), 50 crore annual income is not enough.\n\nI'm here humbly to ask a few questions:\n\n1) Where do most rich bachelors hang out? (Please list down the names and addresses of bars, restaurant, gym)\n\n2) Which age group should I target?\n\n3) Why most wives of the riches are only average-looking? I've met a few girls who don't have looks and are not interesting, but they are able to marry rich guys.\n\n4) How do you decide who can be your wife, and who can only be your girlfriend? (my target now is to get married)\n\n\nMs. Pooja i Chohan.\n\n**A philosophical reply from Indian Billionaire Mukesh Ambani**\n\nDear Ms. Pooja,\n\nI have read your post with great interest. Guess there are lots of girls out there who have similar questions like yours. Please allow me to analyse your situation as a professional investor.\n\nMy annual income is more than 100 crore, which meets your requirement, so I hope everyone believes that I'm not wasting time here.\n\nFrom the standpoint of a business person, it is a bad decision to marry you. The answer is very simple, so let me explain.\n\nPut the details aside, what you're trying to do is an exchange of \"beauty\" and \"money\" : Person A provides beauty, and Person B pays for it, fair and square.\n\nHowever, there's a deadly problem here, your beauty will fade, but my money will not be gone without any good reason. The fact is, my income might increase from year to year, but you can't be prettier year after year.\n\nHence from the viewpoint of economics, I am an appreciation asset, and you are a depreciation asset. It's not just normal depreciation, but exponential depreciation. If that is your only asset, your value will be much worse 10 years later.\n\nBy the terms we use in Wall Street, every trading has a position, dating with you is also a \"trading position\".\nIf the trade value dropped we will sell it and it is not a good idea to keep it for long term - same goes with the marriage that you wanted. It might be cruel to say this, but in order to make a wiser decision any assets with great depreciation value will be sold or \"leased\".\n\nAnyone with over 100 crore annual income is not a fool; we would only date you, but will not marry you. I would advice that you forget looking for any clues to marry a rich guy. And by the way, you could make yourself to become a rich person with 100 crore annual income.This has better chance than finding a rich fool.\n\n\nHope this reply helps.\n\n\nsigned,\nMukesh Ambani",

You'll be given two balls made of a superstrong titanium alloy and no tools. Do something in the vault that will convince us that you're more interesting to us alive than dead, because if you fail to demonstrate your intelligence, we'll dissect you.\"\n\nFirst goes the German engineer.

Apparently \"knowledge of basic physics\" and \"manual dexterity\" are good enough for a human. Meh. We're dissecting him as we speak, bring in the next one.\"\n\nThey put the guru in, five minutes pass and the scientist alien walks into the cockpit even more disappointed.\n\n\"So we open the vault and he's sitting there in a lotus position, the two balls floating in the air around him. He even gives me the \"Are you impressed?\"-look, can you believe that? Apparently, lifting heavy titanium balls is impressive for the human mind. So yeah, they struggle with basic levitation; we're dissecting this one as well. Send in the last one.\"\n\nThe Bulgarian is put in the vault, the vault is sealed. Five minutes pass and the scientist alien bursts into the cockpit, flailing his arms and shouting excitedly at the captain and crew.\n\n\"Guys, you need to see this! Come, leave the saucer on autopilot and come! I swear, I have not seen such a thing in my entire career!\"\n\n\"Calm down, what has he done?\" asks the captain.\n\n\"It's unbelievable,\" continues the scientist, \"in three minutes inside the vault he has managed to lose one of the balls and break the other.\"\n\n***\n\nEDIT: Hey guys, I'm going to bed now, but I'm troubled by the \"I don't get it\"-comments.

He then looked at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. The vet patted the dog and took it out and returned a few moments later with a beautiful cat. The cat jumped up on the table and also sniffed the bird \nfrom its peak to its tail and back again. The cat sat back on its \nhaunches, shook its head, meowed softly, jumped down and strolled out of the room. \n\nThe vet looked at the woman and said, \"I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.\" Then the vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman.\n\nThe duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. \"$150!\" she cried. \"$150 just to tell me my duck is dead?\" \n\nThe vet shrugged. \"I'm sorry.

One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.\nThe first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.\nThe next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.\nThe battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.\nAnd it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.\n\n\nCredit goes to a friend who found it on tumblr",

He jumped out before it crashed but could only take a case of beer, a machine gun and a machete.  On the way down, he drank the case of beer.  Then he landed right in the middle of 100 Vietnamese soldiers.  He shot 70 with his machine gun, but then he ran out of bullets!  So he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more.  Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.\" The teacher looked a little shocked.  After clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story. \"Well,\" Johnny replied, \"Don't fuck with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking.\"",

He walks up the dog and asks \"What's up dog?\"  The dog looks up at him and says \"Nothing, whats up with you?\"  The man astonishingly says \"Holly shit you can talk!  So what's your story dog?\"  The dog replies \"Well when I was a pup my owner discovered that I could talk.  The CIA somehow found out and I was recruited, trained in multiple languages, and started going on missions.  Sometimes they would place me in a room during multinational negotiations and when the Americans left I would stay behind, spy, and report my findings.  Some of shit they said would amaze you.  They would talked about everything from the negotiations, to drugs, and even who they were fucking.  The CIA would also drop me in war zones pretending to be a stray.  I would track down the enemy and listen to what targets they plan on attacking.  Again I would report my findings.  I thwarted many attacks and terror plots.  I can't believe how close most of them were to completing the attacks here on our soil.  After years of service I decided to retire and ended up with my original owner here.  A crazy life I've had and I have stories of my experiences to tell for years.\"  The man exciting says \"Wait there!  I'm going to talk to your owner.\"  He goes up to the old man and says \"Man that dog is awesome!  How much do you want for him?\"  The old man says \"Twenty five dollars and he's yours.\"  The man puzzled asks \"Why such a low price?\"  The old man replies \"Cause that dog is a fucking liar.

But we don't have any boyfriends to go home to, can you help us out?\" \nThe happily married bartender explains to them that he's unable to because he loves his wife. All the while, the third girl on the end is moaning and groaning only making the other women more horny. \n\"Okay, if I help you out can you all just leave?\" \nExcitedly the women agree. \nThe bartender goes to the store room and grabs the biggest cucumber he can find. \n\"Will this work?\" \nShe grabs the cucumber and goes to town on it until she's completely satisfied. \nThe second woman exclaims that she's hornier than the first and that a cucumber just won't cut it. All the while, the third woman just keeps moaning louder and louder. \nSo, the bartender goes to the back and grabs a bottle of champagne. The second woman grabs it from his hands and goes to town on it until she's completely satisfied. \nThe bartender can't believe what he just saw, the whole bottle of champagne disappearing and reappearing. All the while, the third woman groaning and moaning louder than ever. \nAmazed at the site, the bartender grabs three glasses for the champagne to celebrate the craziest thing he'd ever seen in his life. He washes off the bottle and pours the champagne into each glass. All the while, the third woman is moaning and groaning louder and hornier than anything he's ever seen in his life. He moves to hand the third woman her glass but she falls straight down to the floor. \n\"Oh no! Are you okay? Do you still want this champagne?\" asks the bartender. \n\"Sure,\" the woman replies, \"but could you also help me out of this barstool?\" ",

Other devices on the same LAN network can't see it. It won't even get past the POST test. I don't know if it's a problem with my VGA array or not having enough RAM memory, or maybe my CPU unit is bad.\n\nSo with my computer not working, I found the DVD disc of Arrested Development season 1 and watched that instead.

He's slobbery and tar-brained, foul in breath, foul in mind, he's shambling down the halls, associating colors with generic pills like a madman. He claws at the walls on the way in, spins into the main area, body odor and fluids fly about. He takes off his pants and shits directly into the chocolate cake. A person screams and faints at the sight. He starts plugging his butthole with pudding and fucking it over and over again, shouting nonsense and blathering about directions and polling. His wild eyed expression grows frantic as he slobbers on his own dick, ejaculating on the chips and sweating on the food and drink like he was a fresh-squeezed sponge. His begins terrorizing the disgusted, fleeing guests, shlong flapping in the breeze and yodelling the sounds of a deranged Tarzan impression. The racist, sexist, xenophobic trumpet of deranged language fires in every direction, his little grabby hands start moving around, he's a complete loose cannon and he's willing to tear anyone down with him.\n\nFinally, someone grabs this deranged lunatic by the shoulders and starts shaking him back and forth. \"What is WRONG with you?!\" the party's host cries. \"Do you have anything to say for yourself?!\"\n\nThe creepy little man's eyes narrow and he takes a handful of his own shit and eats it.

For a long time, the little girl would read these books of hers, and eventually came to the conclusion that trolls were her favorite creature of them all. She sometimes was bullied for loving trolls so much, but Lucy didn't care, as long as she had her tales.\n\nFlash forward a few years to Lucy's first year of middle school, where she takes a mandatory Tech-Ed class. She's reluctant at first, but soon grows to love the class where she learns to weld, work with wood, design and paint furniture, etc.\n\nOn her 13th birthday, Lucy's father says to her: \"Lucy, get up right now, I'm teaching you to ride a unicycle for the circus.\" \nLucy, confused at first, happily agrees. It takes some time for her to ride the unicycle properly, especially as it is an Extra Large Man's Size Unicycle, but she gets it eventually and starts to become very good.\n\nAlthough she doesn't love unicycle riding, Lucy decides to make it a bit more enjoyable by designing her unicycle to look like a troll: her beloved fairy tale creature. Using some welding techniques from tech-ed, she is able to attach beautiful horns and paints the unicycle to look like a troll.\n\nHowever, while practicing unicycle riding with her father, Lucy gets her first period. Lucy's father, unaware of what to do in this situation, uncomfortably says, \"Alright dear, let's ride to the Pharmacy and get you, ah...\" Lucy, seeing her father's discomfort, agrees to go with him to the near-by pharmacy.\n\nThe two arrive at the pharmacy, and Lucy's father tells her to go inside and get what she needs while he guards the unicycles.\n\nA few minutes pass by, and a man, obviously fascinated by Lucy's unicycle, asks the father: \"My, what is that? I'm not sure I've seen anything like it!\"\nLucy stomps out of the pharmacy with a furious look on her face and a plastic bag.\n\"That?\" says Lucy's father, \"That's a Men's Troll Cycle.\"",

        "body": "This is the story of the pink gorilla. \nThere's these two guys. They're both teachers, and they work at the same school. One is an Anthropology teacher. The other is a Historian. They are both given a sabbatical. For those of you who don't know, a sabbatical is a paid vacation for teachers. They are paid to take time off teaching, but they have to do research to better their knowledge, to better their teaching. \nGot it? \nGood. \nSo, both teachers are given a sabbatical. And, they're very good friends. So, they decide, on this sabbatical they will travel to far reaches of Africa to do some History research and some Anthropology research (Anthropology is the study of human nature). They decide that's what they're going to do. So, they go running down the stairs in their apartment building. *clop-clop-clop-clop* They get into a taxi-cab. *err...err....err* They get to the airport. They go through security. *beep-beep-beep-beep* And all that stuff, you know? They get on the plane. *woosh* Now they're in Africa. They get off the plane. They get on a little plane. *pt..pt...pt...pt* They fly over this tiny little village. The get off the tiny little plane, and there's this Jeep waiting right there for them - with their name on it. So, they get in the Jeep. *zh-zhoom* And they start driving down the road. They're going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...They're seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. Then, they get to this little pygmy village. So, they get out and ask the pygmies, \"What is something just great to see here, where we are?\" They say, \"Well, our rather hit attraction would be a pink gorilla.\" \"A pink gorilla?! No way! You're totally lying!\" The pygmies are like, \"No, actually you just go down this road, take a left turn, then turn right into a big cave.\" So, they get back in the Jeep (which starts right up). *zhoom* So they're going down the road; they're going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...They're seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. They make their left turn. They're still going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...They're seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. They get to this cave! It's got this giant steel door. So they open the steel door. There's this big wooden door. They open the wooden door. There's another wooden door. They open that wooden door. There's this long row of colored doors - orange, purple, pink, chartreuse, salmon, every color you could ever think of. So, they start going through all these doors. They're going open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close. They get through all the doors. There's a big pool of water, and right next to it is some scuba gear. So they put on the scuba gear and dive in. So, they're swimming....swim, swim, swim.....deep water.....swim, swim, swim....very deep water....swim, swim, swim....very, very deep water....Finally, they see another way out, so they swim towards that and get out of the water. \nThey see the pink gorilla! \nAll it's doing is sitting there, completely still. And so, they're observing the pink gorilla. They're taking pictures of it. They're writing down every move he makes - which isn't very many 'cause all he's doing is sitting there, completely still. It's kinda boring, but hey - it's a pink gorilla! The entire time they're watching the pink gorilla, there's one little thing the pygmies said that keeps flashing through they're mind. \"Don't touch the pink gorilla.\" Now, they're like, \"Why can't we touch the pink gorilla? All he's doing is sitting there, completely still.\" But, the Historian was rather smart. The Anthropologist, on the other hand, was like I wish I could get my hands on this thing. I could make a lot of money! So, the Anthropologist walks up and he's about to touch the pink gorilla. And the other guy grabs his hand and says, \"No! You heard what the pygmies said, 'Don't touch the pink gorilla.'\" But, the Anthropologist is just like, \"What could it do?\" The Historian manages to talk him out of touching it, and they keep taking pictures and writing notes about it's behavior - but there aren't very many 'cause all it's doing is sitting there, completely still. Finally, they're ready to leave. They put the scuba gear back on, and get back in the water. So, they're swimming again....swim, swim, swim.....very, very deep water.....swim, swim, swim....very deep water....swim, swim, swim....deep water....Finally, they see original surface, so they swim towards that and get out of the water. They start going through all the colored doors - orange, purple, pink, chartreuse, salmon, every color you could ever think of. So, they start going through all these doors. They're going open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open and close wooden door, open and close second wooden door, open and close steel door. They get in the Jeep, and it starts right up. *zhoom* They're going down the road; they're going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...They're seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. They make their turn. They're still going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...They're seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. They go through the pygmy village. They get to the little airport, get on the little plane. *pt..pt...pt...pt* It takes them to the bigger airport; they get on the bigger plane. *woosh* They get to back to the airport near home. They hail in a cab. They get in the cab. *err...err....err* They go up the stairs in the apartment building. *clop-clop-clop-clop* They're home!\n\nWell, the next semester, the Anthropologist, who is the more gutsy of the two, is awarded another sabbatical. So, in his devious mind he's thinking haha! I'm going to return to Africa, capture the pink gorilla, and make millions of dollars!\nSo, he goes running down the stairs in the apartment building. *clop-clop-clop-clop* He gets into a taxi-cab. *err...err....err* He gets to the airport. He goes through security. *beep-beep-beep-beep* And all that stuff, you know? He gets on the plane. *woosh* Now he's in Africa. He gets off the plane. He gets on a little plane. *pt..pt...pt...pt* He flies over this tiny little village. He gets off the tiny little plane, and there's this Jeep waiting right there for him - with his name on it. So, he gets in the Jeep. *zh-zhoom* And he starts driving down the road. He's going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. He goes straight past the pygmy village. After all, he already knows where he's going. So he's going down the road; he's going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. He makes the left turn. He's still going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. He gets to the cave! He opens the steel door. He opens the big wooden door. He opens the second wooden door. He goes through all the colored doors - orange, purple, pink, chartreuse, salmon, every color you could ever think of. So, he's going through all these doors. He's going open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close. He gets through all the doors. He puts on the scuba gear and dives into the water. So, he's swimming....swim, swim, swim.....deep water.....swim, swim, swim....very deep water....swim, swim, swim....very, very deep water....He gets out of the water. Okay...I've got to get this thing out of here. So, he reaches out towards the gorilla. The whole time the pygmies' warning is playing in the back of his mind. Don't touch the pink gorilla. He hesitates. \nAnd then...\nHe touches the pink gorilla! The pink gorilla goes mad. He's like tearing the place apart! The guy screams. So, he throws on the scuba gear and jumps back into the water.....swim, swim, swim.....very, very deep water.....swim, swim, swim....very deep water....swim, swim, swim....deep water....The pink gorilla's swimming behind him! Finally, he gets out of the water. He starts going through all the colored doors - orange, purple, pink, chartreuse, salmon, every color you could ever think of. So, he's going through all these doors. He's going open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open and close wooden door, open and close second wooden door, open and close steel door. The pink gorilla is just bashing through all the doors. He jumps in the Jeep, and it starts right up. *zhoom* He's going down the road; he's going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...he's seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. The pink gorilla is just running along right behind him. He makes the turn. The gorilla turns, too. He's still going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...he's seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. The pink gorilla is just running along right behind him. They go through the pygmy village. The pygmies are like, \"haha! We told you not to touch it!\" He's still going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...he's seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of - including a pink gorilla in the rear-view mirror. The pink gorilla is just running along right behind him. And all of sudden...the car sputters to a stop. So the guy jumps out of the car and starts running. He's going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...he's seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. The pink gorilla is running along right behind him going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...Finally, the guy collapses. He just can't run any farther. He's just like, \"Whatever you do, just kill me quickly.\" The gorilla walks up to him, reaches down, touches the guy, and says, \"Tag! You're it!\" and runs off down the road. ",

I am lost and hungry, do you perhaps have a phone and some food for me?\" John desperately begs.\n\n\"I am afraid not\" replies the well dressed man \"for you see this is top class establishment. People come here for the isolation, so we have no phones, no modern technology and our food is of the highest quality; not to be simply given away. However, I could consider offering you a room and food for the night if you complete me 3 challenges - completion of them shall be considered payment for your stay. In the morning you can leave. Either way I can still point you in the right direction to get home but I must warn you it will be a days hike.\"\n\nJohn, too desperate to turn down the offer asks \"What are the challenges?\"\n\n\"The challenges are as follows:\n\n1) You must drink this bottle of tequila, in under one minute, for no challenge can be complete without drinking.\"\n\n\"OK\"\n\n\"2) a guest of mine has brought their pet, an alligator. It is being stored downstairs but requires dental work. You will go down there and remove its bad tooth using these pliers. Do not worry, it is a small alligator, you should be able to overpower it easily. You will have 5 minutes to complete this challenge.\"\n\n\"That sounds dangerous but preferable to starvation, OK\"\n\n\" 3) upstairs, one of our older guests has requested someone to lay with. You will be the one to lay with her. You must go upstairs and give her the best orgasm she has ever had. For this challenge you have 20 minutes.\"\n\n\"I can think of worse things to do, I accept your challenge\" \n\nJohn is invited in and instructed to the location of each challenge. He picks up the tequila and prepares himself. The timer is started.\n\nJohn downs the bottle, painfully slugging it down. he finishes it with mere seconds to spare. The effects already kicking in powerfully.\n\nHe runs downstairs, stumbling as he goes, his fatigue is already showing. He closes the door behind him and a struggle is heard. The noises from downstairs are quite alarming but the hotel owner stands by the clock counting the minutes. Nashing and Growling and screaming are all heard, thrashing around and scratching. \n\nTriumphantly, John emerges from the room, clothes ripped, battered and bruised. He stumbles up the stairs confused, looks to the hotel owner and drunkenly asks him:\n\n\"So....hhrrr..... where is the *hic* alligator with the bad tooth?\"\n\n",

This is a cooking website and eggs cracking is not related to cooking. However, as an exception I will allow this question for you and lets see what responses we get.

Please describe which species, texture and color.\n\nSo I did some research and modified the question to \"How do you boil an egg without cracking it? I'm using standard hen eggs that can be purchased at local egg shops. These are the white eggs from the white leghorn chicken\".\n\n> Please mention how you're boiling it, which vessel, for how long, how much water.\n\nI now modified the question to \"How do you boil an egg without cracking it? I'm using standard hen eggs that can be purchased at local egg shops. These are the white eggs from the white leghorn chicken. I'm boiling them in a kettle, with enough water to submerge the eggs. Have boiled them for around 8-10 minutes\".\n\n> Mod here. It would be great if you could provide a link to the bird species and upload a screenshot for your kettle. Please ignore this if you don't think that this is necessary.\n\nI replied that I didn't think it was necessary.\n\n> Mod here. I have edited your question anyhow and provided a link for the hen's species. I have also added a generic image showing a kettle and the boiling egg and deleted all previous conversations.\n\nI replied \"okay cool. It looks good so far. I hope someone replies to it\".\n\n> Mod here.  This question has received 1 vote for closing as \"too subjective\". This question is too vast and cannot possibly be answered by anyone.\n\nMeanwhile my question already had a couple of upvotes and I received the following answer -  \"Are you sure you didn't shake the egg before boiling it? Maybe you were trying to spin them to check whether they were boiled but in the process upset the albumen structure.\"\n\nThat's it! I chose the answer as the right answer and marked my question as answered.\n\n> Mod here. This question has been closed as \"too subjective\" based on 5 votes. There is no way of answering this question. Please modify your question so that it's less subjective and it relates to the community.\n\n*I made up this joke on the stackexchange websites based on how strict their community is.

        "body": "having broken away from the Catholic church, Henry had angered many adherents both domestic and abroad, and sought to shut down any institutions that swore their allegiance to the Catholic church before he had a revolt on his hands.  \n\nHe  attempted to completely squash all churches, monasteries and friaries that remained devoutly Catholic.  While for most he could simply cut off their ability to function by seizing their assets, but the Friaries in England were mostly self-sufficient with large gardens where the Friars grew the majority of their own food while sustaining the rest on the patronage of their followers.  In protest to the King, the Friars started gifting their patrons with beautiful flowers - creating a symbol of resistance against the edicts of the King.  \n\nFurious, Henry made a Royal decree barring Friar's from growing or gifting flowers, but the decree was completely ignored by the Friars and in fact the symbol of the flower grew more powerful.  Desperate to put an end to it, Henry called upon the most feared man in England - Hugh the Executioner.  Hugh was a special import who had made a name as a effective killing machine in France, and had been brought to England for the execution of Anne Boleyn.  A couple things made Hugh unique.  For one, he had a massive stature, but more importantly Hugh opted to use a long-sword instead of the Axe which was more common at the time.  Most terrifying of all, Hugh did not wear an executioners mask, but instead enjoyed the fact that people could recognise him as the face of death.\n\nThe king sent Hugh around to the Friaries with his royal decree, and with each Friary Hugh would bang the hilt of his long-sword against the door before attaching a copy of the decree with a sharp dagger.  Within days, the flowers disappeared from the streets and the Friaries began to shutter their doors.\n\nWhat is the moral of the story?  \n\n*Only Hugh can prevent Florist Friars!*",

He steadily approached the group to get even a hint of the conversation, may he attempt to chime in. The group hears his awkward footsteps and simultaneously pierce him with their smug faces. Still, the boy musters his strength, swallows his spit, and asks what this secret conversation was about.\n\nFor some reason, the head of the group was not reluctant to tell him the secret. He was baffled by that.  The head of the group replied that they were speaking of a *purple cornflake*. However, to the new student's dismay, he was instructed to never speak about it anyone, ever. As soon as he was briefed the group dispersed like the creatures that disperse from under a rock when exposed to sunlight.\n\nThe new student, had alredy decided, quite hastily that he would embark on whatever endeavor needed to find the origin of the abominable *purple cornflake* that dare not be mentioned to anyone, ever! The student later on raised his hand in the middle of class and asked to approach the teacher's desk. She acknowledged, and he ran up to her. His little quivering, immature lips spit out a broken phrase of what sounded like but was definitely like, \"what's a *purple cornflake*\"? The teacher, instantly enraged, told the new boy to take himself to the principal's office, and such behavior is unforgivable.\n\nThe student walked to the school's main office, and it was there in the front office, in front of everyone, he encountered the sad and cliche working class man. The principal got his rocks off by disciplining kids, and put the child on blast. He asked, \" why did your teacher send you here, boy?\" The boy replied, \"becuase I asked my teacher what a *purple cornflake* was....What's a *purple cornflake*? \n\nThe principal instantly became enraged while deeply sickened to the point of vomiting. The principal then called the police and told him what kind of sick little monster they were dealing with. The captain himself, came down, running into the main office of the school with guns drawn. They tasered the boy and beat him tightly to break his already broken spirit. It was only till the boy awakened in his cell with the captain sitting right outside. The captain asked the boy, just why...why the child had decided to say and think such horrible things. The student persisted in saying he asked his teacher and principal what a *purple cornflake* was. He looked up at the captain with trembling eyes and asked, \" what's a *purple cornflake*?\" \n\nThe captain stood up, opened the cell door walked up and grabbed the boy by the neck like he were a rag doll. He exclaimed that he couldn't even stand the sight of the boy, that his words made his stomach turn. The captain said he didn't even want him in the jail. \n\nThe boy is faced with tough decisions at this point, pursuing a pointless and insignificant dream. No, he persisted that he was looking for the truth. Freedom. However, he couldn't return to his family with such shame that society had stigmatized him with. No, he stumbled into an alley where he crawled into a box with a homeless man who immediately offered his services for drugs. The child wasn't even phased, he asked the homeless man what a *purple cornflake* was with utmost prestige and confidence that surely only a war hero could possess. No, it was he, that day who possessed this pride. The homeless man put his maggot rotted hobo cheese dick back in his pants, looked up in that unforgettable disgusted face he had seen in so many others. The homeless man screamed, \"get the fuck out my box, you can't stay here, sick fuck!\" The boy crawls out the box, walks into the street, gets hit my a bus and dies instantly.",

Why did you take the quarters instead of the dollar bill?\u201d The boy licked his cone and replied, \u201cBecause the day I take the dollar, the game is over!\u201d\n\n\nTwo campers are walking through the woods when a huge brown bear suddenly appears in the clearing about 50 feet in front of them. The bear sees the campers and begins to head toward them. The first guy drops his backpack, digs out a pair of sneakers, and frantically begins to put them on. The second guy says, \u201cWhat are you doing? Sneakers won\u2019t help you outrun that bear.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t need to outrun the bear,\u201d the first guy says. \u201cI just need to outrun you.\u201d \n\nA guy is sitting at home when he hears a knock at the door. He opens the door and sees a snail on the porch. He picks up the snail and throws it as far as he can. Three years later there\u2019s a knock on the door. He opens it and sees the same snail. The snail says, \u201cWhat the hell was that all about?\u201d\n\nA guy meets a hooker in a bar. She says, \u201cThis is your lucky night. I\u2019ve got a special game for you. I\u2019ll do absolutely anything you want for $300 as long as you can say it in three words.\u201d The guy replies, \u201cHey, why not.\u201d He pulls his wallet out of his pocket and one at a time lays three one hundred dollar bills on the bar, and says slowly. \u201cPaint\u2026my\u2026.house.\u201d\n\nA guy dies and is sent to hell. Satan meets him, shows him doors to three rooms, and says he must choose one to spend eternity in. In the first room, people are standing in dirt up to their necks. The guy says, \u201cNo, let me see the next room.\u201d In the second room, people are standing in dirt up to their noses. Guy says no again. Finally Satan opens the third room. People are standing with dirt up to their knees, drinking coffee and eating pastries. The guy says, \u201cI pick this room.\u201d Satan says Ok and starts to leave, and the guy wades in and starts pouring some coffee. On the way out Satan yells, \u201cOK, coffee break\u2019s over. Everyone back on your heads!\u201d\n\nt\u2019s game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final, and a man makes his way to his seat right at centre ice. He sits down, noticing that the seat next to him is empty. He leans over and asks his neighbour if someone will be sitting there. \u201cNo,\u201d says the neighbour. \u201cThe seat is empty.\u201d \u201cThis is incredible,\u201d said the man. \u201cWho in their right mind would have a seat like this for the Stanley Cup and not use it?\u201d The neighbour says, \u201cWell actually the seat belongs to me. I was supposed to come with my wife, but she passed away. This is the first Stanley Cup we haven\u2019t been to together since we got married.\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry to hear that. That\u2019s terrible\u2026.But couldn\u2019t you find someone else, a friend, relative or even a neighbour to take her seat?\u201d The man shakes his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re all at the funeral.\u201d\n\nTwo old actors are sitting on a bench. One says, \u201cHow long has it been since you had a job?\u201d The other actor says, \u201cThirty two years \u2013 how about you?\u201d The first actor says, \u201cThat\u2019s nothing.

        "body": "There was a little boy who lived in a far away land. Close to the boy's home, there was a tall mountain, always covered in snow at the top. Also at the top of the mountain, there was an ancient monastery where ancient monks lived.\n\nSometimes, the little boy, as he was riding his tricycle around his yard, would look up at the monastery on the tall mountain and wonder what it was like up there. \n\nOne day, when the wind was blowing down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold and the little boy could hear a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.\n\nSo, the little boy made a peanut butter sandwich, hopped on his tricycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours and hours, but he finally made it to the top. He bravely pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Monk, sir. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the head monk, \"I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\nSadly, the little boy got back on his tricycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.\n\nThe wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was a bit bigger and stronger now and now rode around town on his bicycle.\n\nAs luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.\n\nSo, the bigger boy made a ham and cheese sandwich, hopped on his bicycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.\n\n\"Hey, Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the head monk, \"I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\nSadly, the big boy got back on his bicycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.\n\nThe wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy had grown into a strapping youth now and rode around town on his motorcycle.\n\nAs luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.\n\nSo, the strapping youth grabbed a slice of pizza, hopped on his motorcycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 30 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.\n\n\"Yo, Mr. Monk, dude. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the head monk, \"I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\nSadly, the strapping youth got back on his motorcycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.\n\nThe wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was now a young man and often rode around in his new convertible sportscar.\n\nAs luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.\n\nSo, the young man bought a burger at a fast food place, got in his convertible sportscar, and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 20 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.\n\n\"Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the head monk, \"I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\nSadly, the young man got back in his convertible sportscar and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.\n\nThat night, he thought and thought about the very strange noise and how he just had to know what caused it. So, he resolved to do something about it the next day.\n\nThe next day, he got in his convertible sportscar and raced up the mountain, slammed on his brakes, and skidded to a stop right in front of the massive door to the monastery.\n\nHe honked the horn of his convertible sportscar until the head monk finally opened the door.\n\n\"Alright, Mr. Monk, I want to know what is making that very strange noise coming from you monastery!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the head monk, \"I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\n\"Well, then can I become a monk?\"\n\n\"Why certainly! It is quite easy. You must travel the earth and count the number of blades of grass in every field and the number of grains of sand on every beach. When you return with your answer, then you shall be a monk.\"\n\nSo the young man left the monastery and travelled the earth. For years and years he counted the blades of grass and grains of sand, until one day he had finally finished. He made his way slowly back to the monastery and found the head monk.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Monk, I have travelled the earth these past years, counting the blades of grass and grains of sand. I finally know that there are 123,123,123,123,123 blades of grass in the fields and 123,123,123,123,123 grains of sand on the beaches and I would like to become a monk.\" \n\nSo the man became a monk. At last, he would now be able to find out the source of that very strange noise coming from the monastery.\n\n\"Mr. Monk, what is the noise coming from the monastery?\" asked the new monk.\n\nThe head monk replied, \"The source is too complicated to describe in words. I am afraid that you must see it for yourself to truly understand it. This key will show you the answer you seek.\"\n\n\"Take this key to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. There you will find a long corridor. At the end of the corridor is a door and through the door is the thing that makes the noise.\"\n\nWell, of course the new monk went immediately to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and there he did indeed find the long corridor. He walked down the corridor until he could see the door at the end. \n\nUnfortunately, there were three magical fires that never go out blocking the man from the door. He decided to jump the fires to reach the door. The man made sure the key was secure in his hand, took a running charge at the first fire and leapt!\n\nOver the first fire he flew, but he dropped the key. The man leapt back over the fire, ran all the way back down the long corridor, out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and back to the head monk.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the first one as I leapt over it.\"\n\n\"Do not worry, for there is another key and you must overcome tests on your way to enlightenment. The second key, however is far, far away in Canada.\"\n\nThe new monk left the monastery and travelled to Canada. It took many years because he had no money, being a monk and all.\n\nEventually, he arrived in Canada and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. \n\nThe three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.\n\nOver the first fire went the monk, key still in hand!\n\nOver the second fire went the monk, key still- RATS!\nHe had dropped the key in the second fire. The monk leapt back over the second fire, back over the first fire, back down the long corridor he walked and out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. The monk went back to the head monk.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the second one as I leapt over it.\"\n\n\"Do not worry, for there is one more key and we must all overcome tests on our way to enlightenment. The third key, however is far, far away in Australia.\"\n\nThe monk left the monastery and travelled to Australia. It took many years because he had no money being a monk and all.\n\nEventually he arrived in Australia and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. By this time, he was quite an old monk.\n\nDown into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.\n\nOver the first fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!\n\nOver the second fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand! \n\nOver the THIRD fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!\n\nHe had made it! He'd made the jumps and here he was standing outside the door with the answer to his question. Finally, finally, after so many, many, many years of wanting to know what was making the strange noise, he would know. The answer lay through the door in front of him and he could at last be at peace with himself.\n\nSlowly, the quite old monk slid the key into the lock. Turning the key a slight 'click' was to be heard as the lock moved back allowing the quite old monk to open the door. He pushed the door open and stepped inside. \n\nShock and amazement came over him as he finally realized the answer to his question!\n\nSo, Reader, do you me to tell you what is was?\n\nI'm sorry, I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.",

I wonder if there are any more around here?\"\n\nHearing this, the leopard halts his attack in mid-stride, and slinks away into the trees. \"Whew\", says the leopard. \"That was close.

But the dog sees him heading off after the leopard and figures that something is amiss. The monkey soon catches up with the leopard, spills the beans about the dog's ruse and strikes a deal for himself with the leopard. The leopard is furious at being made a fool of and says, \"Hop on my back, monkey, and see what's going to happen to that conniving canine. \"Now the dog sees the leopard coming with the monkey on his back, and thinks, \"Oh boy, it looks like I've really had it now.\"\n\nBut instead of running, the dog sits down with his back to the leopard and the monkey and pretends that he hasn't seen them.

I walked home. \n\nA few weeks later I get some more money in the bank and like a real P-I-M-P I proceed to give all my sweet money to the casino, hoping I will make a killing this time. Well you cynical fucks, I actually do win like a champ this evening and I walk out that evening with about 20.000 Euro's. All happy and cheerfull about not having to walk home and being able to call an escort that evening I go to the cab spot. Now I'm out of the casino a lot earlier than last time and luckily there's plenty of cabs around. \n\nThe thing is, this one driver, who told me to go suck a dick is standing at the front of the row. Being on top of the world made me come up with a plan to get even with that guy real fast. I go into the last cab and ask how much it is to get to my house, the driver tells me it's 30 Euro's. I tell him I'll pay him \u20ac100 bonus if he's up for it and unzip my pants. The dude goes nuts and throws me out of the cab. Luckily for me all the other cab drivers also were not thristy for some man to man action. Arriving at my cab buddy from a couple of week ago I get in and ask him how much to get me home. He tells me \u20ac30, I tell him I had a great night at the casino and show him the money. I tell him I want to make people happy today and I'll give him \u20ac200 if he waves at all his colleagues when we drive away, but it has to be really cheerfull.

However, she remembers what her boss told her, ...don't reject the guy outright.  \nSo, she tries to think of a way to dissuade the businessman from wanting to marry her. After a few minutes, the woman says to the man, \"I will only marry you under three conditions. First, I want my engagement ring to be a 75-carat diamond ring with a matching 200-carat diamond tiara.\"\n\nThe African king pauses for awhile. Then, he nods his head and says, \"No problem!! I have. I have.\"  \n\nRealizing her first condition was too easy the woman says to the man, \"I want you to build me a 100-room mansion in New York. As a vacation home, I want a chateau built in the middle of the best wine country in France.\"  \n\nThe African king pauses for awhile. He whips out his cellular phone and calls some brokers in New York and in France. He looks at the woman, nods his head and says, \"Okay, okay. I build. I build.\"  \n\nRealizing that she only has one last condition, the secretary knows that she'd better make this a good one. She takes her time to think and finally she gets an idea. A sure-to-work condition. She squints her eyes, looks at the man and says, rather coldly, \"Since I like sex, I want the man I marry to have a 14-inch penis.\"  \n\nThe man seems a bit disturbed. He cups his face with his hands and rests his elbows on the table, all the while muttering in African dialect. Finally, after what seemed like forever, the king shakes his head, looking really sad, and says to the woman, \"Okay, okay. I cut. I cut.\"",

Their best scotch will set you back a few hundred pounds but it is worth it.\"\n\nThe Irishman, half drunk, then said, \"Oi mates, a pub is about drinking and having fun not spending money that I don't have. Let me tell you about this place in Ireland. They give you drink after drink for free until you don't want to drink no more. And then you can have sex with anyone you want in the place. And then you can get more free drinks.\"\n\nThe Scotsman and Englishman are in disbelief.\n\nThe Scotsman said, \"You are drunk, this place certainly does not exist.\"\n\nThe Englishman said, \"Certainly not, how can a place like that stay in business. You are a liar.\"\n\nThe Irishman exclaimed, \"I swear on the souls of my mother and father and all my children this place exists.\"\n\nBoth the Scotsman and Englishman said, \"Then tell me, my friend, what is the name of this place and where is it located?\"\n\nThe Irishman replied, \"To be honest, I have never been there as I have only heard about this place yesterday.

If you can tell me how you died, and I think it's pitiful enough, I'll let you in.\"\n\n\"I'll tell my story first,\" says one man.\n\"So, I'd been pretty certain lately that my wife had been cheating on me. I only didn't have any proof. I thought the best way to find out would be to catch her in the act. I devised a whole plan: I left the condo for work in the morning as normal, then I got in the elevator. Once I'd gone down to the lobby, I took the elevator back up and busted into my condo. There my wife was, sitting on the couch reading a magazine. Silly me, I thought, thinking my wife was cheating on me. Except I saw a pair of hands hanging on off the ledge of the balcony of my condo. So this is the man! Oh, I was so livid, I ran over to the ledge and started stomping on his hands. He still wasn't letting go. So I ran into my condo and grabbed a hammer and started banging on his knuckles. Finally, he let go and fell three stories and landed in a bush. Bruised up, but still okay. I wanted to end this thing so I ran into the kitchen, dragged the refrigerator and pushed it over the ledge onto the man, killing him instantly. After all that excitement, I had a heart attack right then and there and died.\"\n\nSt. Peter said \"wow. That is a pitiful death. Okay, you can come in. Next?\"\n\nThe second man said,\n\"Well, I was doing my daily workout routine on my balcony. While doing jumping jacks, I'm not sure how, but I lost my balance and fell off the balcony. Next thing I know, I'm holding on for dear life to the balcony on the level beneath my condo. This is the end, I thought. Except, just then a man stepped over to me. I'M SAVED, I thought. That was until he started stomping on my hands. I was terrified. When he realized I wasn't letting go, he ran inside and came back with a hammer. He hammered on my knuckles until I finally let go, falling three stories and landing in a bush, bruised but okay. As I reached for my phone to call for help, suddenly I see a refrigerator fall from the condo and smashing into me, killing me instantly.\"\n\nSt. Peter said, \"wow. That, too, is a pitiful death. Okay, you can come in. Next?\"\n\nThe third man comes up to tell his story\n\"Okay, picture this... I'm hiding in a refrigerator.\"",

He stared at the boy, with his bright blue eyes open wide, giving away the fact that he had never once fired a pistol before, eyes which were partially covered by a lock of hair black as night. \n\nThe young pirate captain tipped his three-pointed hat to the boy as he leaned over with a slight bow.\n\n\"What's ye name, me boy\", the pirate captain asked.\n\n\"Sebastian, sir\", the boy whispered.\n\n\"Aye, well Sebastian, me boy, a t'ousand t'anks and a t'ousand pieces o' silver me owes ya.\"\n\nThe pirate captain whistled to one of his crew, and ordered them to leave the young boy on the ship with a small chest filled with silver coins.\n\nThen the pirate crew jumped back onto their majestic ship, and sailed off into the sunset.\n\nMany years went by, and the pirate captain grew old, having lived quite the successful life of a pirate, which was quite rare, as they were constantly hunted by all of society for their ignoble actions.\n\nOne day, as the pirate crew was at harbor to resupply their ship, the pirate captain met a beautiful woman who not only failed to judge him, but was rather quite enthralled by his stories from the sea. \n\nAs they were sharing a bottle of rum, the pirate captain was reminiscing about his dual sword wielding days, which were no more, after having lost a hand to a stray cannonball many years prior, when the beautiful woman asked if he ever intended to settle down and have a family.\n\n\"Aye, me love, t'was always on the back of me mind, but me life has been wrought with adventure and chaos, and the thrills of a nomad pirate captain such as me'self were never too kindly looked upon by the fairer sex...\"\n\nThe beautiful woman ran her hand across the pirate captain's beard, caressed his face, and as she leaned over, she whispered \"I always wanted to sail the sea... but I fear it was never in my stars, for I get seasick simply by stepping onto a ship. But your tales tell me that you have lived a mighty full life, and I fear I will never cease to dream of you after tonight...\"\n\nThen, the beautiful woman gently kissed the pirate captain on his lips.\n\nFor what seemed like an eternity, they stayed locked face to face, as the beautiful woman held the pirate captain's good hand in hers, as he began to shake at the knees, melting at her touch.\n\nAs they pulled apart, the pirate captain said, \"Bless the gods, me dear, I've never in me whole life felt the warm touch of an angel like that... just say the word, and I'll follow you to the ends of the world and back.\"\n\nThe night went on, and when it came time to part ways and sail off with his crew, the pirate captain realized that he couldn't bring himself to go, for he did not want to leave behind the beautiful woman who had taken his breath away, and given in return a warm desire and fullness he had never felt before.\n\nThe pirate captain was in love.\n\nHe took his hat off, and handed it to his first mate, saying his farewells, wishing his crew the best of luck and long lives, and waved them away until they had sailed out of sight.\n\nAgain, many years went by. The pirate married the beautiful woman, they had a small army of children who grew up and set sail on their own adventures, and life went on.\n\nThe pirate captain was happy, but grew restless. Time had become a bitter enemy, causing his body to deteriorate even more and his mind to grow cloudy. His feet hurt from walking the solid land, and he missed his majestic ship, and his faithful crew. \n\nHis wife saw these things, and tried many times to lift his spirits, but it was fruitless. \n\nThe pirate had turned to drown his fears in his bottles of rum, and often could be heard hollering at the gravestones in the town cemetery, battling the ghosts of his past.\n\nThe locals had ceased to fear the once powerful and vibrant pirate captain, as he was now just an old shell of his former self. \n\nHe had grown fat, had lost most of his hair, and his long flowing beard had grown gray and disheveled. The hook on his hand had been replaced by a wooden knob with a cutout perfect for holding a bottle, and nothing more.\n\nThe pirate captain was sad.\n\nDespite all her efforts, the pirate's wife could not save him from himself. She grew tired and weak from all the fighting, until one day, she had had enough, and decided to leave him.\n\nThe pirate captain did not chase after her.\n\nAnd so life went on, and the long days turned into long months, and the long months turned into longer years. The pirate was lost in a world he did not love, left alone with no friend to share a bottle with, and no enemy to swing a sword at.\n\nThe pirate captain was alone.\n\nHe grew older, and weaker. His swords began to rust, and grew dull. His bottles lay strewn about his home, and his body regretted his heart's decision.\n\nOne day, the pirate decided he would not end this way. He would go out as a pirate should. He would do whatever necessary to right the wrongs, or wrong the rights, in his case.\n\nHe would go down to the harbor, and steal a ship, and set sail into the sunset one last time.\n\nExcept, he could barely get out of bed. When he finally managed to, barely escaping a broken back in doing so, he barely made it to his door.\n\nWith a mighty tug, he opened the door, and what he saw outside his door almost made him fall to the floor.\n\nThere was a parade! \n\nThe entire town had filled both ends of the street, with children sitting upon their father's shoulders, and women waving handkerchiefs at the performers in the street.\n\nAt first, the pirate was weary, and did not want to be surrounded by all of this joy, for he simply wanted his story to come to an end already, and dammit, these town citizens were getting in his way!\n\nHe shuffled along down the road, step by step, often having to put a hand against a wall or a fence post to stop and catch his breath.\n\nHis heart was beating a thousand times too fast, and his head ached with all the music being played in the street beside him.\n\nThings began to grow dark in his vision, and sounds grew muffled.\n\nHe stopped to sit at a bench, wiping the sweat from his brow with his shirt sleeve. He looked around for a forgotten bottle of rum. Alas, there was none to be found.\n\nHe saw a young boy running back and forth, peeking between the legs of the adults to catch a glimpse of the parade through the throngs of people watching the festivities.\n\nThe old pirate asked the young boy, \"hey there, me lad...\" The old pirate took a few deep breaths between his words, \"would ye mind tellin' an old man what all this fuss might be about?\"\n\nThe young boy looked the old pirate up and down, curious why this old man was sitting on a bench not ten feet from the parade, sweating like a dog and panting like a horse.\n\n\"It's the Queen's Royal Navy, sir! They're back! It took them 50 years, but they've finally killed all the pirates! The seas are free again!\"\n\nThe old man chuckled at the idea that the sea was ever not free, but then took a sharp breath in as the boy's words sunk in.\n\nWith the last of his strength, he pushed himself off of the bench, and walked to the street, pushing the bystanders aside with a roughness in him that had long been idle.\n\nHe looked at the paraders, who upon further inspection, were in battle dress. It was the Queen's Royal Navy, indeed!\n\nThen, standing on top of a box wagon, the old pirate saw what must have been the man in charge. \n\nThe man was middle aged, in peak physical condition, with striking black hair and blue eyes as big as the sea.\n\nBut it was what was in the man's hand, as he waved it back and forth at the crowds, that caught the old pirate's eye.\n\nIt was his old leather three-pointed hat. \n\nThis man, he was the one who had killed off the last of the pirates, and in doing so, had obviously killed the old pirate's former crew, including his last first mate.\n\nAs the old pirate stood there, wondering how he should feel, knowing that the life he had led and had dreamed of returning to could be no more, the man with the blue eyes turned towards him, looked at him, waving the hat, and continued to turn.\n\nStopping in mid-wave, the man turned back, and looked at the old pirate dead in his eyes. \n\nThe old pirate knew, right then, who this man was. He knew it like he knew the sound of sails flapping in the wind on a cool, cloudless night.\n\nThis man, he knew, was Sebastian, the very boy who had not only saved his life, but had felled one of his own crew in order to do so.\n\nThis man, who had brought an end to the life the old pirate once cherished, who had ended the lives of so many that had relied on the old pirate, was the one person that had ever saved the old pirate's life.\n\nThe sudden epiphany took a hefty toll on the old pirate's soul. He felt like he had been struck in the chest with a cannonball. \n\nHe almost lost his footing, falling back, reaching his hand out to find the bench behind him, with his wooden hand held to his chest to calm his heart. \n\nIt was beating too fast.\n\nThe man from the Navy, Sebastian, was running up to the old man, pushing his way through the crowd.\n\nAs he arrived at the bench, he looked the old man up and down. \n\nThe man, the boy, Sebastian, placed the hat gently on the bench beside the old pirate.\n\n\"I know you, old man. I once saved your life, and you repaid me with a ship and a thousand silver pieces. I have led my life in the hopes that I would cross paths with you again...\"\n\nThe old man looked at the young man, and saw nothing but the young boy from that day so long ago, before him. He had dreamt of crossing paths with the young boy again as well, but his heart was hurting, and not in the heartbroken way he had become so used to over the years, but rather a physical pain, this time. It stopped him from being able to express the words in his lungs.\n\nThe boy with the blue eyes continued.\n\n\"...I lived every day of my life, and spent every last bit of silver I had because of you, trying to find you. When I ran out of money to fund my own ship and crew, I joined the Queen's Royal Navy in the hopes that it would bring me to you...\"\n\nThe old pirate wanted nothing more than to reach out to the boy, to pat him on the shoulder, to thank him for finding him and giving him a last good memory to cherish on what was surely to be his last day on this earth. Perhaps he could ask the boy to send him out to sea, as a pirate should always be buried at sea...\n\nSebastian continued.\n\n\"For, you see, I did not intend on saving the life of a murderer that day, I did not even intend on leaving that ship alive... \n\nI did not want my last memories to be the vision of you and your despicable crew cutting down my friends, my crew... \n\n...and had I seen my father behind you, with his sword raised and ready to strike you down, I never would have tried to fire that shot into your heart. \n\nAnd I would have not missed, and killed my own father instead.\"\n\nThe old pirate's face grew white, his skin, cold.  \n\nThe story he had shared countless times to his old crew and the land lovers at the pub, his favorite story of all of them... had all been a lie. \n\nAll because this boy was a terrible shot. \n\nHe had intended on killing him, and killed his father instead. And while the old pirate knew that his younger self would have reveled in this fact, his older self felt more guilty than he could have ever imagined feeling.\n\nHis entire life had been a farce.\n\nHe was not the least bit angry at Sebastian, nor did he doubt that he would pay for his actions today, likely at the gallows.\n\nThe boy continued.\n\n\"And so, here we are, having killed every last pirate sailing the ocean, and the one I have been hunting my entire life has been here in my hometown. Wasting away! A drunk and a fool, with no ship, no treasure, and a rusty pair of swords.\"\n\n\"His wife left him!\", shouted one of the town members.\n\nSebastian looked back at the townsman, and looked back at the old pirate with a smug look on his face.\n\n\"And the old man had a wife, you say? It figures she would have left him! Who would want to lay by an old and dying pirate like this at night!\"\n\nThe townspeople laughed and pointed their fingers, with mothers covering their children's ears, yet standing there with beaming smiles on their faces. \n\nSebastian picked up one of the old pirate's swords, wielding it slowly and deliberately, feeling it's weight.\n\n\"This must have been a wicked tool of death back in your day, old pirate. But now...\"\n\nHe rested the tip of the sword on the ground, and gave a swift stomp to the middle of the sword, shattering it in half.\n\n\"...but now, it's a piece of useless scrap. Now, tell me, old pirate, and do be kind, it's the least you can do before dying on me after I've searched for you for so long, and after I've asked ALL your friends for your whereabouts... \n\nWHAT, in almighty God's name, HAPPENED TO YOU to make you such a feeble, weak, pathetic old geezer wasting away as the town drunk on a dirty bench so far from the ocean? \n\nPlease, tell me what caused this, and I might let you die quickly.\"\n\nThe old pirate looked the boy up and down, realizing the boy was a man. A man that any mother would be proud of, and a boy any father would thank the heavens for carrying his name.\n\nThe old pirate coughed into his wooden hand, and saw blood which he wiped off onto his pants, and stretched to lean over with his good hand to pick up the hat Sebastian had placed beside him.\n\nIt took nearly all the energy he had in him, and as he righted himself, the world was spinning. His arm shot pains throughout his body as he raised his hat and placed it on his head.\n\nHe placed his good hand on the bench armrest, and pushed as hard as he could, raising himself from the bench to stand before the boy. A boy who was as tall, no, taller, than he was. But the old pirate had a bad back, and he was hunched over after spending so many years in his bed.\n\nHe stretched his back, and stood tall one last time. \n\nHe raised his good hand to grab the tip of his hat, and gently tipped it towards the boy, and as he bowed slightly, he could feel his heart pumping the last pulse of blood through his body... his fingers and toes growing cold, his vision growing cloudy, and his head feeling light, he uttered his last few words with every bit of strength that his soul would spare before finally leaving him.\n\nWith a smirk so slight, the Heavenly Father could have missed it, he answered the boy's question.\n\n\"Sebastian, my boy...\n\n\"...long...\"\n\n\"...time...\"\n\n\"...no...\"\n\n\"...sea.\"",

        "body": "Everyday news from the front would trickle into our village via fleeing refugees, radio, and telegram.\n\nOur army was being beaten from what I could tell, and were in full retreat from the invading Easterners. \n\nThe Easterners, savage men according to all the adults in my village, and the man in the television. Beings who were rather more beasts than men, beasts that ate babies and burned children alive. My father would tell me stories of these Easterners, stories that made me terrified for my life. \nSome days at school during play-time, me and my friends would gather under a tree and wonder what an Easterner even looked like. \n\n*\"Probably like bears!\"*\n\n*\"No! like giant ugly wolfmen, with big teeth! Grrr!\"*\n\n*\"Maybe big angry bulls! With horns!\"* \n\nWe were children, and we knew nothing of the horrors of the war that had been raging across the world for the past 5 years. \n\n*Curiously enough to the west of our village was a large forest, that no child was to ever enter. Just like the stories of the Eastern soldiers, our parents told us that there were horrible things in the forest, things that would love to eat a child.*\n\nFor a while things suddenly died down that is until Winter came.\n\nOn 1 snowy morning a column of tired looking men with torn clothes and covered in bandages marched into our village. These were soldiers of our Army? Far different from the textbooks and pictures I had seen years ago, when the war first started, these almost half awake men looked like a stiff breeze would blow them over. \n\n....\n\n\nPapa told me that we would have to flee to the West, the Easterners were near, Nearer than anyone in the village could've even anticipated. \n\n*\"But the soldiers will protect us Father!\"* I begged as He and my mother frantically began packing our belongings onto a wagon, but he seemed to ignore me.\n\nMy infant brother cooed in his crib at all the commotion to which he was ignorant too. As I looked out the window I saw all our neighbors were already either packing or making their way on the main road which ran North and out of the town. \n\n*\"Everyone is leaving Mama!\"* \n\n**\"And we will have to go too dear\"** My mother replied tiredly \n\n*\"Where?\"*\n\nMy mother sighed as while she folded one of my dresses\n\n**\"I don't know..\"**\n\n\nThe tired looking soldiers that came this morning had opted to leave as well, and were traveling along the same road North as the people from our Village. My Father picked me and my brother up and loaded us onto a wagon which he pulled himself. I took a last look through the window of our house and saw how bare and empty it was, before we trodded off Northward.\n\n...\n\n\nI was excited to leave the village, and get to see what was outside of it, but the sights I saw were less than exciting.\n\nI saw trees and houses blackened by fire and shattered by bombs. There were dead dogs and horses covered in flies that lay at the side of the road, and my heart felt, sick. The earth was covered in frost and bare, parts of it were upturned and shallow graves filled them. \n\nI looked to the East of the road and saw the forest again, it's tall dark trees seemed to be untouched by the carnage that I saw. Father had drawn our wagon for hours, and I saw as the sun set in the horizon and nightfall came. We opted to make camp for the night with several other columns of people  from our village and soldiers, and wait until morning.\n\nThe night was silent and dark, there was no campfire, and there was no sound of crickets or birds. It seemed like we were the only living things left in the world.  \n\n...\n\n\nWhen I did fall I asleep, I was woken shortly afterwards by the sound of a man's scream \n\n\nI soon heard loud booms, and the popping of rifles. \n\nMore screams and more booms.\n\n*My father cried out to our mother before something cut him down.*\n\nShadowy men on horses yelped and screeched as they rode into our camp. \n\nEasterners\n\nThey yelled out in their horrible tongues as they cut down men and women alike\n\nThe world devolved into chaos as torches began to be thrown onto the wagons and tents, and fire consumed them.\n\n*I looked around for my mother in the dim light, but she was nowhere to be seen*\n\nIn a panic, I grabbed my baby brother and fled to the shelter of the trees in the woods to our East.\n\nThe sound of hooves, guns, and screams was deafening, and my infant brother wailed in confusion from the carnage.\n\n....\n\n\nMy lungs and feet burned, and my knees bled from scraping up against the foliage and bushes. I fled until the noise of the battle died down, and I was alone in the dark and dead silent forest.\n\n*Silent, save for the distant sound of a what appeared to be crow's cry*\n\n\nMy brother by this time had somehow fallen silent and asleep, and I looked up to see that the moon was all but blocked off from the trees which looked taller now that I was actually in the Forest.\n\nMy fatigue hit me like a running horse all at once, and I found that I was incredibly drowsy. I carried my brother and myself over to a nearby tree where we fell asleep under its canopy. \n\n\n...\n\nWhen morning came, I still felt tired, and barely any sunlight was able to make its way through the dense canopies of the trees. \n\nThere were no sounds of chirping birds in the trees, and the wind seemed to be dead. The forest was dark and silent just like it was at night. \n\n",

He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he\u2019d try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn\u2019t much like the idea of her screwing someone else.  \n\n\nSo he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around.  He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him.  He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter.  He explained his situation, the old man. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don\u2019t know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except \u2026\u201d said the old man, and then he stopped. \u201cExcept what?\u201d asked the businessman. \u201cNothing, nothing,\u201d said the old man. \u201cC\u2019mon, tell me! I need something!\u201d protested the businessman. \u201cWell, sir, I don\u2019t usually mention this, but there is the \u2018voodoo dick,\u2019\u201d the old man said. \u201cSo what\u2019s up with this voodoo dick?\u201d the businessman asked.  The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols.  He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo.  The businessman laughed, and said, \u201cBig fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!\u201d The old man said, \u201cBut you haven\u2019t seen what it\u2019ll do yet.\u201d He pointed to a door and said \u201cVoodoo dick, the door.\u201d The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole.  The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle.  Before the door could split, the old man said, \u201cVoodoo dick, get back in your box!\u201d The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, quiescent once more. The businessman said, \u201cI\u2019ll take it!\u201d The old man resisted and said it wasn\u2019t for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. \n\n The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, \u201cVoodoo dick, my pussy.\u201d He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.  \n\n\nAfter he\u2019d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny.  She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said \u201cVoodoo dick, my pussy!\u201d  The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping.  It was great, like nothing she\u2019d ever experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she\u2019d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting.  She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked.  Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off.  So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help.  She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo.  \n\n\n On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman.  He asked for her license, and then asked how much she\u2019d had to drink.  Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn\u2019t been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn\u2019t stop screwing. The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, \u201cYeah, right. Voodoo dick, my ass!\u201d",

And again Johnny replies with: \"A pink penguin, a pink penguin!\" So his dad searches throughout the entire country; again, obviously, no luck. So he returns and gives Johnny a brand new car as a gift. Then Johnny turns 25 and his dad asks him what he wants for graduating college, and again Johnny says that he wants a pink penguin. Now his dad looks through the entire continent: he goes to Canada, Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Argentina. No luck. So he returns in time for Johnny's graduation and he gives him a boat as a gift. A few years later and Johnny turns 35, this time his dad is way ahead of him and has spent the whole year looking all over the world for a pink penguin, he's gone to China, Japan, Germany, Russia, South Africa, Australia. But alas, no luck, so he want ahead and bought Johnny his own private jet.

After another awkward pause, the woman says \"I don't believe you!\" to which the man says \"Well, then, come up to my room and I'll prove it to you!\"  Of course the lady lets her curiosity get the best of her and goes up to his room with him.  \"Take off your underwear and lie on the bed\" says the man. She does so, after which he takes the frog out of the box and holds it up to her gooch.  The frog does nothing. \"Eat!\" commands the man. Nothing. \"EAT!\" he yells.

The boy asks \"what's the third letter of the alphabet?\" His brother, engrossed in the film, shouts out \"Superman!\" And the boy moves on. He goes to his little sister, who's playing in her toy car.

The teacher is outraged, and angrily asks \"how dare you?

Among everything at the farm, the boys father was very amazed and interested in the automatic cow milking machine. The boys father look at his son and asked him to send one these machines to India, he said \"I'm a old timer now, I can't milk the cows at the farm in India, maybe these machines could help\".\n\nThe boys father went back to India, few days later the automatic cow milking machine arrived. The machine did really help, saved lot of time.\n\nOn one fine morning, the boys father was very happy and cheered, he was going to start milking the cows and get things done as usual. He looks at the machine and gets a nasty though. He thought \" What would happen if I insert my penis in one of these pipe?\". To answer it, he sits on a chair, grabs the pipe and shove his penis in, the vacuum instantly pulls his penis down, which felt very comforting to the old timer. He grabs a newspaper to read while the machine did the job of his hand. \n\nFew minutes later, he was done, he had literally masturbated with help of the machine, he decided to quickly get to work. He grabs the pipe and pulls it down, Nope it din't come out, his penis was stuck inside the the pipe due to the vacuum, he was tired, and the machine didn't stop. It happened again, he ejaculated for the second time, this got him very angry and tired. The pipe won't come out.\n\nHe screamed for help, but no one could hear him with that loud sound of the machine. He was sweating and screaming for help, he quickly decided to call his son to England. He quickly tell his son about the whole situation and that the pipe wont come out.\n\nThe boy was angry and screamed \"Din't you read the manual?, it clearly says that \"This machine stops after 5 Liter\"....

The man swings again, then starts running around in his cell.\n\n\"What are you up to this morning?\" the priest asks the inmate.\n\"I'm keeping up my skills, because when I get out of here, I'm going to be a professional baseball player!\" the inmate replies.\n\n  The priest walks further down the hall, uplifted by the hopeful spirits of the young men he has passed.  He looks into another cell and finds a man with his pants around his ankles, thrusting his hips madly.  As the priest cranes his neck to figure out what the man is doing, he seems to be having his way with a can of Planters.\n\n\"And what will you be doing when you get out of here?\" says the priest to the pantsless inmate.\nTo which the inmate replies, \"Me? I ain't never gettin out of here, I'm fuckin nuts!\"",

And after a little more talking he goes on his way.\n\nNext day he's taking his daily walk again. And there she sits, crying again. Walking to her again he asks what the matter? She's say well the hug you gave me yesterday was very comforting, but... I've also never been kissed by any man and in my condition probably never will. So he leans in slowly and gives her a little Peck on the cheek. She smile's but he can feel she wants a little more, he leans back in a gives her a passionate kiss on the lips. She now smiles ear to ear and giggles some, satisfied with how happy she was now he goes on with his walk.\n\nNext day same beach, same girl, same tears. He walk over and says now now what's a matter today. She says the hug was nice, the kiss was better but that just has her thinking if that will be all she'll ever have. Will she ever get fucked. Surprised by this he says well maybe I can help with that to. She smiles and nods. So he reaches down lifts her from her chair, walks over and throws her in the ocean.

        "body": "(Just a few of my favorites)\n\nA man is getting ready to get married to a very Orthodox wife, and he goes to her rabbi for help. He's recently converted and very unfamiliar with Jewish weddings. \n\"Rabbi, for the wedding, do I sit with my wife?\"\n\"No, the men sit with the men and the women sit with the women.\"\n\"Okay, can I dance with my wife?\"\n\"No, the men dance with the men and the women dance with the women.\"\n\"Okay Rabbi, a few questions about sex... Can we do it missionary position? Like, man on woman?\"\n\"We don't call it that, but yes, that's fine.\"\n\"How about cowgirl style? Woman on top of man?\" The rabbi scratches his chin. \n\"A little kinky, but there's nothing in the Torah against it.\"\n\"How about standing up?\"\n\"Absolutely not, that could lead to dancing.\"\n--\nSeveral centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal: he'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community. If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave. \nThe Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise rabbi to represent them in the debate. However, as the rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Yiddish, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate. On the chosen day the Pope and rabbi sat opposite each other. The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. The rabbi looked back and raised one finger. Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. The rabbi pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy . \nLater the Cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, \"First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our faiths. Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all \naround us. The rabbi responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and host to show that through the perfect sacrifice Jesus has atoned for our sins, but the rabbi pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He bested me at every move and I could not continue.\" \nMeanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the rabbi how he'd won. \"I haven't a clue,\" said the rabbi. \"First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger. Then he tells me that the whole countrywould be cleared of Jews but I told him emphatically that we were staying right here.\" \n\"And then what?\" asked a woman. \n\"Who knows?\" said the rabbi. \"He took out his lunch, so I took out mine.\"\n--\nThere was a little old Jewish man who was having a bit of trouble below the belt. His wife told him to see what was wrong, and after a lot of nudging he finally went to the doctor, and was surprised when the doctor told him he had syphilis. As he sat on the bus on the way home, he turned the word over in his head, he had never heard it before. \nWhen he got home, his wife said, \"Nu, Hymie, what did the doctor say?\"\nHymie shrugged and said, \"I'm not sure. He said it was syphilis, but I'm not sure what that is.\" \n\"Wait- I'll go look it up.\"\nHymie's wife checks the dictionary and returns to the room. She pats him on the back.\"We have nothing to worry about. It's a disease of the Gentiles.\"",

The two tubists who volunteered as bouncers were letting everyone through when the drum line shows up.\n\n\"Can't go in here, you're not invited,\" the tubists say as the other drummers go in. \"Says right here.\"\n\n\"Why can't I go?

Curious, she enters the shop and asks the shopkeeper why it is so cheap.\n\n'Well' he says 'There is a bit of a problem with that one... See, it was sold to woman who returned it because she couldn't keep up the payments on it. Problem is, she also happened to be the owner of a brothel, and it's happened to have picked up a bit of bad language. If you don't have a problem with any of that you can have it for only $50'\n\nThe woman, never one to pass up a bargain, thinks 'how bad can it be?' and pays the $50 and takes the bird home.\n\nShe hangs the cage with the large and beautiful bird up in her living room when she gets home. The parrot says: 'New house. New madam!'\n\nShe thinks this isn't too bad, and is beginning to think she's got a great bargain when her teenage girls come home from high-school. 'New house. New madam. New whores!' Screeches the bird.\n\nThe girls are a little shocked, but their mum explains the situation and they have a bit of a giggle about it and think nothing more of it.\n\nLater that evening the woman's husband comes home. As he comes in the front door the bird says 'Hi Frank!'",

As a higher-up in his corporation, he tends to be away from home several times a month, and wants to ensure his wife stays faithful.\n\nWhen he reaches the counter, he's shocked to see an old, wizened man tending it. He asks, nervously: \"Do you work here?\"\n\nHe replied \"Yes, I do\".\n\nStill stupified by this mystical old man, the husband stammers...I uh...uh..am looking for something for my wife. My work requires me to travel and I wan't something that can keep her satisfied so she won't cheat on me.\n\nThe old man blinks slowly a few times, then says: \"Yes, I believe we have what you're looking for.\" He pulls out a wooden box, covered in dust. It looks ANCIENT. As he opens the lid, the smell of old wood floods the husband's nostrils. \n\nThis here is a Voodoo dick. It has magical powers and I assure you, it would keep any women satisfied.\n\nThe husband laughs harder than he has in a long time. \"Did you say VOODOO dick? HAHAHAHA I can't believe you're trying to sell me this sh*t\".\n\nThe old man just looks at him. \"Allow me to demonstrate to quash your doubts, I suggest you stand away from the door.\"\n\nThe husband looks behind him, and with a quizzical look on his face, takes three steps away from the door he was leaning against.\n\nThe old man speaks. \"VOODOO DICK, The door!\"\n\nAll of a sudden, the gnarled, wooden shaft lying dormant inside the box floats into the air. It levels off with the doorknob, then soars through the air directly at the keyhole. \n\nA thunderous bang bang bang can be heard as the voodoo dick tries violently to enter the hole that is far too small for it. The door starts to shake and hinges rattle.\n\nThe man says I'LL TAKE IT!!!!!\n\nThe old man then says VOODOO DICK, the box!\n\nAnd as if on rewind, it slowly glides back into the box, and lay still.\n\nUpon arriving home, his wife asks him what he has in the box. \"It's a voodoo dick, honey\", he says. The wife starts dying of laughter. \"Voodoo dick? hahahahaha you must be joking!!\"\n\nThe husband gives her a stern look and says: \"Listen, I know how lonely you get on those business trips of mine, and this will keep you occupied so I know you'll be faithful.\" \n\nHe then says: \"Voodoo dick, her pussy!\" The lid of the box bursts open as the dick flies through the air, directly towards his wife's crotch. There is the definitive sound of her panties ripping as the dick penetrated through the fabric, into it's designated spot. \n\nThe wife: \"What the he....hey....ooooo...mmm...oh...my...god...!!!!\" She is shaking on the couch.\n\nThe husband smiles and says, see you later honey, I'm going golfing with some pals from work!.\n\nShe is too busy biting her lips to respond.\n\nThree hours pass. \n\nFinally, decided she's been satiated, the wife tries to remove the dick from inside her. She pulls, tugs at it with all her might, but it won't budge. The thing remains inside her and refuses to move.\n\nShe panics.\n\nShe sees her husband's cellphone on the living room table. He forgot it. And he didn't tell her how to turn the thing off!\n\nWith the voodoo dick still thrusting inside her, the wife runs to the garage and starts the car. She has to get to a hospital. She's freaking out. \n\n12 minutes later, she is pulled over by a traffic cop for doing nearly double the speed limit. He asks her why she felt she needed to risk her life and the life of others by speeding. He thinks she's on drugs, because she's not talking coherently.\n\nOfficer...oh...ahh...see...uh..my husband bought this....voodoo dick...for me and it won't come out!!..And oohhhhhh.......ahh...he didn't tell me how to turn it off! He's gone..golfing with his friends...and I can't...get a hold..of him.\n\nThe officer looks at her with a blank expression on her face.\n\nHe bursts out laughing.\n\n\"Hahahahaha, that's a new one! Never heard that one before! Voodoo dick, my ass!\"",

It is my pleasure to set the record straight.\nA little known fact is that back in 1912, Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise was manufactured in England. In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to be the next port of call for the great ship after its stop in New York. This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico but as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York.\nThe ship hit an iceberg and sank and the cargo was forever lost. The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great that they declared a National Day of Mourning, which they still observe to this day.\nThe National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5 and is known, of course, as Sinko de Mayo.\nGo out on this day, grab a couple of slices of Wonderbread and a jar of Hellman\u2019s mayonnaise and have a party. You know I will!\n\n",

The ship hit an iceberg and sank, and the cargo was forever lost. \n\nThe people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise, and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of Mourning, which they still observe to this day. \n\nThe National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5th and is known, of course, as Sinko de Mayo.",

They wanted easy to swallow crap that was familiar and easy to listen to. They wanted the same old shit, instead of something original!\"\n\n\"Well, I'm fucking fed up!

He was flustered, and with no comeback, he stormed out of the tent as the laughter continued.\n\nHe saw that the circus would return in a year, so in the intervening months, he spent as much of his leisure time at the library, reading, researching, and watching everything he could about insults, retorts, and sarcasm, until he KNEW he was ready if the clown picked on him again.\n\nHe went back to the circus, ate delicious popcorn, watched the acts, and was generally pretty relaxed, and then the clown came out. Same as before, he went around the big top, insulting every single person he thought looked out of place, and when he recognized Fred, he smiled big, saying \"Oh look, it's the extra from Deliverance again!

The vet tells him that they will stop standing around and will lie down and wallow in the grass when they are pregnant. The farmer hangs up and gives it some thought.

Seeing that they are all still standing around, he deduces that the first try didn\u2019t take and loads them in the truck again. He drives them out to the woods, screws each sheep twice for good measure, brings them back and goes to bed. Next morning, he wakes to find the sheep still just standing around.

Marty was treated to a surprise birthday party that he did not know about. He got cake and presents but was not satisfied. Marty's dad walked up to him and said, \"Marty, it doesn't seem like you want any of your presents. What would you like for your birthday?\" Marty said, \"I want a pink ping pong ball!\" Dad thought this was just a phase that he is going through and agrees to buy such a weird item for his son's birthday.\n\nFast forward to Marty's graduation day. Marty was dressed all nice and his parents were taking photos of him. His parents wanted to get Marty anything he wanted, no matter the price. Marty looked at them and said, \"I want a pink ping pong ball!\" Both parents looked at each other and agreed since it was such a special day. In their minds, however, they were wondering what Marty is doing with these ping pong balls. \n\nFast forward to Marty's wedding day. Marty is in his tuxedo with his newly wedded wife next to him. He sees his parents and his teenage brother grabbing some food. They see Marty and walk over to him. Marty's brother said, \"Congrats bro! For this special day, I will get you anything you want that is reasonable for me to afford. Quickly, Marty said, \"I want a pink ping pong ball!\" The brother was shocked and sort of weirded out by this request. Without complaint, he agrees. \n\nFast forward about 50 years later. Marty is on his hospital bed where the doctors say he is not going to make it. Marty is barely awake and his grandson is by his side. The grandson is crying and wants to ask a question to Marty. He says, \"Grandpa Marty, can you answer this one question that I have been meaning to ask you for years? Why did you always ask for a pink ping pong ball for a gift?\" Marty looks at him and says, \"Well my boy, it is because...\" And then he dies.\n\n",

Let me set the mood for you, this was an 18 and up FULLY NUDE titty joint\u2026. Real classy, well this particular night it was a $25 all you can drink beer night. My brother and I were like hell Yeah! We paid our money and steered toward the bar ready to start drinking. We roll up and ask the barkeep and asked where the \u201call you can drink\u201d beer is? He pointed over to an old raggedy ass folding square table, the kind you Mexican grandma brings out during Easter, and Christmas to sit the kids at. On top of this table was a tried and true keg of beer in a trash can filled with ice. It was the good Lord giving me a sign to take my brother and run\u2026 Of course I didn\u2019t listen, so we went up to the keg and got our cups filled with none other than KEYSTONE LIGHT! So here I am, $100 dollars deep worth of cover and beer passes, drinking keystone light, in the butt naked club\u2026 I shake all this off and we go sit near the stage, time goes by and this older stripper keeps bothering my brother, when are you going to buy me a drink? Can I sit here? Blah blah blah, he kept shooing her away, for one because he didn\u2019t have any money, I was sponsoring this whole adventure, and for two this stripper looked like something that came out of a Tim Burton film. Nasty shaggy hair, looked like she brushed her teeth with a snickers bar, legs dimply like a golf ball, no ass to speak of. But for some reason she liked my brother. As the night went on I went to the back to get a private dance, I\u2019m in there about 10 minutes and here comes snickers teeth! She pokes her head in and says I got your brother back her and he says you have the money. I\u2019m like ya here\u2019s 40 bones just to get her to go away. My dance ends, so I make my way towards the front and like a scary movie out pops snickers teeth again from one of the rooms, I look over her shoulder and I see my brother sitting on a couch, drunk, looking like hell.. I look at the girl; she looks left, then looks right as if she\u2019s checking for the cops and whispers to me, \u201cIll suck your brother\u2019s dick for 30 bucks\u201d. I think to myself, this is a hell of a deal, so I reach in my wallet and after counting my money I say to her, \u201cI have 11 dollars\u201d without missing a step she says done, grabs the money and runs to my brother. I was shocked and a little pleased that I was hooking my brother up with such a bargain. So I go to take a piss and about midstream one of the bouncers tells me, hey bro you got to go. I\u2019m like, for what? He says we caught your brother with his cock out. I\u2019m in total shock, here I am dick in hand and this 400 pounder is telling me my brother is getting thrown out. It may have been the keystone scrambling my brain but I couldn\u2019t understand why they would throw him out after I just paid my 11 bones to the stripper. So I hurry and finish and quickly go to the front and there is my brother between the bouncers, pants unzipped, shirt untucked and the manager is giving him this lecture. He\u2019s like give me your wallet, my brother reaches and hands him his wallet, the manager shuffles through it trying to find some cash, with each item he takes out, the more disappointed he gets, my brother has a condom, expired Bennigan's gift card, a school ID, a receipt from game stop, and 2 dollars, the manager was so pissed he told him to just leave bro. the whole way out the door they shamed my brother, yelling, you\u2019re despicable bro, what kind of place do you think this is, I can\u2019t believe you\u2026  the stripper never even got his dick in her mouth, best 11 bucks I ever spent.",

The pharmacist helped the boy for about an hour. He told the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex. At the cash register, the pharmacist asked the boy how many condoms he'd like to buy: a 3-pack, 10-pack or a family pack. 'Oh well, I'm really going to put it to this girl,\" the boy tells the pharmacist. \"I intend to plug every orifice in her body at least twice. The pharmacist, with a laugh, suggests the family pack, saying the boy will be rather busy, being his first time and all.\n\nThat night, the boy showed up at the girls parents' house and met his girlfriend at the door. \"Oh I'm so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!\" she said. The boy happily went inside and was sweetly led to the dinner table where the girl's parents were seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bowed his head. A minute passed; and the boy was still deep in prayer with his head down. Ten long minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy. Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend finally leans over and whispered to the boyfriend, \"I had no idea you were this religious\". The boy turned, and whispered back, \"I had no idea your father was a pharmacist\".",

A third boat appeared. \n\n\n\"This is your last chance, get in!\" yelled the boatman. \n\n\n\"No, Jesus will save me!\" came the reply. \n\n\nThe boat went off and a couple of seconds later, the man drowned. Arriving in Heaven, he was greeted by Jesus. \n\n\n\"Hey, Jesus, I trusted in you and you let me down! I don't believe it!\" \n\n\n\"Neither do I. I sent three fucking boats to save you.\" ",

The second nun comes to sister Jude  and says she does not want to be a nun and again Sister Jude says \"Go commit a mortal sin and then I will tell you what to do.\" So the nun comes back 3 hours later and says, \" I stole a bike from a little boy.\" \"Ok,  go drink from the holy water and yo are no longer a nun.\" Sister Jude says. Then the third nun comes and again says she does not want to be a nun. \"Go commit a mortal sin and then talk to me.\" Sister Jude says yet again. \"Well, I knew you were going to ask me to do this so I already committed a sin.\" The third sister said. 'What did you do?\" Sister Jude asked. \"I peed in the holy water\"",

Hare being over confident agreed to the new term and reached the next at the chosen track.

This question is too vast and cannot possibly be answered by anyone.\n\nMeanwhile my question already had a couple of upvotes and I received the following answer -  \"Are you sure you didn't shake the egg before boiling it? Maybe you were trying to spin them to check whether they were boiled but in the process upset the albumen structure.\"\n\nThat's it!

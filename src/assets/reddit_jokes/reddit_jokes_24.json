I put my keys in the doorknob, give it a little jiggle, and bust open the door ready to catch them in the act.  I walk down the hallway and look into our room and there she is lying naked in bed!  I know somethings up and I search around for the guy all the while my wife is hysterical I could accuse her of such a thing.  Just as I'm about to concede, I see these two little hands hanging on the balcony floor... the nerve of that guy!  So I go over and stomp on his hands, causing him to fall to the ground, but he hit a tree on the way down and he didn't die.  I was in such a rage that I went into the kitchen, unplugged the fridge, and with all my hate, I pushed the fridge off of the balcony and it landed on the guy and killed him.  My wife... in her hysteria and anger, took a knife and jabbed me in my side and here I am.\"\n\nA stunned St. Peter looks at the guy and says, \"yeah, you're in.  Come on in.\"  Next guy:\n\n\"So how was your day?\"\n\"It was really weird.  I was doing yoga on the balcony of my 7th floor condo when I must have lost balance or something and I accidentally fell over but thankfully I grabbed hold of the balcony right below me.  Just as I'm about to pull myself to safety, some psycho yelling obscenities stomps on my hands and I feel down but I didn't die.  I knew I had a broken leg, and as I'm trying to peel myself off the ground, I look up and see a fridge coming at me and here I am.\"\n\nSt. Peter chuckles to himself and replies, \"You're in.\"  Third guy:\n\n\"So how about you?

He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try.\n\nOne day Gerald revealed his secret desire to his colleague, Harold the Physician, the King's chief doctor. Harold thought about this and said that he could arrange for Gerald to satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Gerald readily agreed to the scheme.\n\nThe next day, Harold made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Harold informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that, among all of the citizens of the kingdom, only the saliva of Gerald would work as the antidote to cure the itch.\n\nThe King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Gerald to their chambers. Harold then slipped Gerald the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours he worked with verve and elan to remove the itching on the Queen's magnificent breasts.\n\nThe itching was eventually relieved, and Gerald left satisfied. He was haled by both the King and Queen as a hero.\n\nUpon returning to his chamber, Gerald found Harold demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his hunger now satisfied, Gerald didn't care, since he knew that Harold could never report this matter to the King. With a laugh, he told Harold to get lost.\n\nThe next day, Harold slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Gerald.\nThe moral of this story is: Pay your medical bills. ",

Being curious, I asked him what he had in the bag to which he replied \"It is not really important or any of your business\"; so I just minded my business and shrugged it off. We keep going down this road and the bag continues with the strange noises, so once again curiosity overtook me and I asked about the bag again. This time he seemed even more fed up with me and said \"Listen, if you needed to know about the bag you would, it's none of your business, so just keep driving.\" So at this point I start to become impatient and it wasn't five minutes down the road when we crossed an old bridge and with this the noise that came from the bag was louder than ever. So, I pulled over, looked at the hitchhiker and told him that he is either going to tell me what's in the bag or get out, to which he replies \"What's in my bag is none of your Damn business!\" so I kicked him out and continued driving. I then realized that the bag was still sitting there in the back seat so, I turned around and unzipped the bag.",

He reaches over and grabs his girlfriend's breast, but the parents say nothing. He takes it a step further and proceeds to strip her naked right there at the table. Not a word. He bends her over the table, and fucks her right in front of them. After he finishes, he thinks that there has to be a way to get someone to talk. \n\nHe jumps across the table, bends the mother over, and  fucks her right there in front of God and everyone else.

        "body": "Once there lived a man. This man was so unextraordinary in every way possible that we are just going to call him John Smith. John was married to woman that I cannot describe as attractive because she was quite physically bland. John knew this was a mutual quality they shared, so he was content in his marriage. Every morning, John woke to a breakfast prepared by his wife that consisted of a slightly burnt piece of toast, reasonably runny eggs, and black coffee. He would then eat and say goodbye to his wife, who would only kiss his check because their relationship was just a tad bit to dry for kiss on the lips. All the while, John thought nothing of his bland life while climbing into his always empty minivan because he truly felt nothing.\n\nOnce at his office, where John work in a very disposable sales position, he was called to speak to his boss. John believed he would be fired, but he didn't really care. He sat down across his boss in the man's gloomy, dark office. His boss said, \"John we need to branch out this business, so I am sending some of the sales team abroad to find some extra clients. Don't get excited because this isn't a promotion.\" John wasn't even approaching excitement. \"How would you like to go to Mexico?\" said John's boss with an unsure grin. \"I suppose\" replied John. \"Okay then\" said the boss, \"go speak with my secretary, and she will give you your ticket\" John walked toward the door,but was paused by one last statement from his boss. \"Oh... John... whatever you do, do not stay in the Hotel Mexico.\" Puzzled, John asked, \"Why?\" His boss fell very silent, and quietly yet sternly responded with, \"Just don't.\"\n\nOnce back home, John shared the news of the trip with his wife over dinner, who despite seeming unimpressed said, \"Oh that will be fun dear.\" The two finished dinner in silence and retreated to the bedroom at 9:30 where John was only able to fantasize of seducing his wife, for she always insisted only sleeping at least five inches apart. The next morning, when John was about to leave for the airport, he was stopped by his wife he seemed more concerned than usual. She grabbed his arm and urged, \"Promise me one thing... do not stay n the Hotel Mexico.\" What do you mean, what is it?\" John replied extremely confused and almost worried.\" \"No time to explain, you'll miss your flight\" his wife said, brushing her comment aside. Before he could process what she said, John was brushed out the door by his wife just as quickly as her comment.\n\nThe trip was very uneventful for John except for the inflight movie. Before the film began an advertisement was shown displaying the Hotel Mexico. The ad depicted the hotel as 'five stars' and a luxury of Mexico. John realized his wife and boss were most likely telling him not to spend too much money. Content with this conclusion, John turned off the TV and sleep the remainder of the flight.\n\nOnce in Mexico, John needed to find a Hotel. The first hotel he came to was a rent by the hour. John walked in to check the rates, but was immediately repelled at sight on two hookers and either arm of a pimp and drunk snorting a line of cocaine at the bar.\n\n \"That's Mexico for you.\" John thought as he went on to the next hotel, which just so happened to be the apparently notorious Hotel Mexico. Thinking it wouldn't hurt to at least take a look inside, John entered the Hotel Mexico. John was bewildered for he had never seen such a beautiful sight as the lobby of the Hotel Mexico. Floor to ceiling, he witness the golden architecture and awe inspiring statues. John went over to the reception desk and looked at the rates. To his even greater astonishment, John found the rates to be only$27 a night. John thought it was too good to be true, and just as he was about to rent a room he remembered the words of his boss and wife. John then turned around and left the hotel on behalf of those wishes.\n\nAs John walked to the next hotel he was very confused to why his boss and wife did not want him staying in the Hotel Mexico. Once at the next hotel, which seemed to be fairly nice and something he would normally settle for. Inside, John found that the rates exceed $300 a night. Now at his most confused, John stormed out of the hotel and on to the next. For the next several hours John searched for a hotel, but could only find extreme prices or drugged addicted whores. Fed up and tired, John decided to return to the Hotel Mexico. John purchased a room and went to it. Due to the low price, John was expecting a small dank room, but was surprised with a first class suite. Exhausted, John jumped into bed thinking his wife was insane.\n\nJohn woke the next morning and felt more refreshed than ever. He then went to his sales meeting, which he landed. It was then time to return home. John went back to the Hotel Mexico to pack his things. John said goodbye to the beautiful palace, the Hotel Mexico, and headed for the airport. Once home, it was time for John to immediately go straight to the office. First thing there, John was called into his bosses office. John's boss asked how the  trip was and John replied with, \"I made the sale. Also I stayed at the Hotel Mexico, I don't know what you were talking that place is grea...\" \" You did what?!\" John's boss replied in anger. \"What?\" John asked. John's boss suddenly blew up in complete rage. \" WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU THINKING! YOU DID THE ONE FUCKING THING I TOLD YOU NOT TO, YOU ILLITERATE FUCK! PACK YOUR FUCKING THINGS AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF THIS OFFICE! YOU'RE FIRED YOU STUPID PIECE OFF SHIT!\" John was in such shock that he did not argue. He packed his things and left.\n\nAt home, John's wife greeted him by asking how the trip was. John just said, \"I got fired.\" Showing true concern his wife asked why. John hesitated and told her not to get mad. \"You didn't.\" she replied with fear. \"I stayed at the Hotel Mexico\" John whispered. Without another word John's wife slapped him across the face marched upstairs and began throwing his belongings out the window. \"What the hell are you doing!\" he shouted. \"What's so wrong with the goddamn Hotel Mexico!\" \"WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH THE HOTEL MEXICO!\" she violently mocked. \"JUST GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE YOU ASSHOLE.\"\n\nHeart shattered, John did as he was asked, and once again packed his things and left. John only had one place to go, so he went to stay with his brother Nathan, who lived on a lake. Fishing was past time of their brotherhood, so Nathan took John out on the canoe to talk about John's wife. For a while the sat in silence, until Nathan asked, \"What happened? Did you screw that girl at work, man?\" \"Fuck no\" John fought back. \"I'll tell you. I don't know why you would, but please don't get mad Nathan, you're all I got.\" \"I won't bud.\" Nathan promised his younger brother. Nervously, John said, \"Well... here goes nothing... I... I went to Mexico for a business trip, and... I... stayed at the Hotel Mexico.\" \"YOU DID WHAT!\" screamed Nathan. At that moment Nathan stood up in the canoe ready to scream at John more, but before he could breath another word, Nathan shook the canoe too much, and flipped it.\nThe two brothers drowned that day at the lake.\n\nYou're probably asking yourself why the hell you just read all of that, and if you did make it all the way through that I'm impressed. And now for the answer to the ultimate question!\n\nWhat is the moral of the story?\n|\n|\n|\n|\nDon't stay at the Hotel Mexico? Nope that's not it.\n|\n|\nKeep going.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nThe moral of the story of the Hotel Mexico is.... don't stand up in a canoe.\n\nRemember, this story might just save your life one day.\nYou're welcome\n\nAnd I have no sympathy for you, if you are angry for just waiting all of your time reading this, for you didn't have to sit through the three hour long spoken version.\n",

(Especially note the last sentence!) \n\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLACING MOUSE BALLS \n\nMouse balls are now available as FRU (Field Replacement Unit). Therefore, if a mouse fails to operate or should it perform erratically, it may need a ball replacement. Because of the delicate nature of this procedure, replacement of mouse balls should only be attempted by properly trained personnel. \n\nBefore proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining the underside of the mouse. Domestic balls will be larger and harder than foreign balls. \n\nBall removal procedures differ depending upon the manufacturer of the mouse. Foreign balls can be replaced using the pop-off method. Domestic balls are replaced by using the twist-off method. \n\nMouse balls are not usually static-sensitive.

I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a \nyoungster, too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem.

Suddenly Adam halted. Jerking back swiftly holding his face in his hands, he nasally asked \"What's that smell?!\"  Embarrassed,  Eve answered shyly, \"I don't know\".  Adam replied \"Well go wash yourself or something\"  Eve quickly stood up, rushed to the ocean waters and began cleaning.  Then, a terrifying thing happened.

The manager there arranges for him to take an aptitude test (Section: Floors, sweeping and cleaning). \n\nAfter the test, the manager says, \"You will be employed at minimum wage, $5.15 an hour. Let me have your e-mail address, so that I can send you a form to complete and tell you where to report for work on your first day. Taken aback, the man protests that he has neither a computer nor an e-mail address. To this the MS manager replies, \"Well, then, that means that you virtually don't exist and can therefore hardly expect to be employed. \n\nStunned, the man leaves. Not knowing where to turn and having only $10 in his wallet, he decides to buy a 25 lb flat of tomatoes at the supermarket. Within less than 2 hours, he sells all the tomatoes individually at 100% profit. Repeating the process several times more that day, he ends up with almost $100 before going to sleep that night. And thus it dawns on him that he could quite easily make a living selling tomatoes. Getting up early every day and going to bed late, he multiplies his profits quickly. \n\nAfter a short time he acquires a cart to transport several dozen boxes of tomatoes, only to have to trade it in again so that he can buy a pick-up truck to support his expanding business. By the end of the second year, he is the owner of a fleet of pick-up trucks and manages a staff of a hundred former unemployed people, all selling tomatoes. \n\nPlanning for the future of his wife and children, he decides to buy some life insurance. Consulting with an insurance adviser, he picks an insurance plan to fit his new circumstances. At the end of the telephone conversation, the adviser asks him for his e-mail address in order to send the final documents electronically. When the man replies that he has no e-mail, the adviser is stunned, \"What, you don't have e-mail? How on earth have you managed to amass such wealth without the Internet, e-mail and e-commerce? Just imagine where you would be now, if you had been connected to the Internet from the very start!\" \n\nAfter a moment of thought, the tomato millionaire replied, \"Why, of course! I would be a floor cleaner at Microsoft!\" \n\nMoral of this story: \n\n1. The Internet, e-mail and e-commerce do not need to rule your life.\n2. If you don't have e-mail, but work hard, you can still become a millionaire.\n3. Since you got this story via e-mail, you're probably closer to becoming a janitor than you are to becoming a millionaire.\n4. If you do have a computer and e-mail, you have already been taken to the cleaners by Microsoft. ",

This time, the items that are first on their list consist of a top-of-the-line blender model, some slotted spoons, and some baking materials. Easily their best asset, though, is a celebrity-endorsed whisk, exclusive to their target store. Their contact has offered $5500 for it alone, and it\u2019s the only one in the store judging from the store\u2019s inventory records.\n\nBeginning the job, the robbers enter the store with little trouble by suspending the security system for thirty minutes, enough to complete the job. They grab the spoons first, along with an armload of salad forks, and proceed to the appliance section, where they grab a microwave and the target blender. Relieved that everything is going smoothly, the crooks head to the side entrance, where baking utensils are shelved.\n\nThere it is. $5500 in bended metal perched on a plastic holder in a shiny glass case, its endorser\u2019s face smiling down from the large sign hanging above. To the robbers\u2019 dismay, they can see that the glass case, when broken, will set off a second alarm. They pause to discuss.\n\n\u201cHow much time would it take for the cops to get here?\u201d the crook holding the microwave and blender asks.\n\n\u201cWith its own system like that, I\u2019ll bet this thing is high-priority. Five, ten minutes, maybe?\u201d replies the other.\n\n\u201cFuck. Shit! We\u2019ll never make it. What if they catch us?\u201d\n\nThe man shifts his armload of forks and spoons as he considers, but with $5500 within reach it\u2019s not a difficult decision. He turns to his comrade, expression grim.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a whisk I\u2019m willing to take.\u201d",

In his professional opinion, showing fat, sweaty tourists a whole bunch of coins was possibly the worst job in the world, but it did pay the bills.\n\nThe tour began and the first stop was at the toonie machine. The tourists oohed and ahhed at the systematic spitting out of toonies, with their shiny silver rims and bronze cores.\n\n\"Did you know that the inner core of the toonie can withstand up to 181 kilograms of force\" the guide stated, with an almost robotic voice.\n\nThe tourists scrunched up their faces,  presumably attempting to process the fact, and convert the metric measurements into the imperial system.\n\n\"Any questions?\" asked John, \n\nThe crowd was silent, and after a few seconds, a middle aged man raised his hand. \n\n\"Excuse me sir, but why did Canada choose to use a polar bear on the toonie?\"\n\nThe tour guide sighed and said \"I'm sorry but I'm not sure, you can check our website for further details. Anything else?\"\n\nAnother man spoke up \"Um, can we just move along?\"\n\nThe crowd murmured in agreement, all except for the man that asked that first question.\n\nThe next stop was the quarter machine. The tour group coughed as the putrid fumes entered their nasal passages, but were amazed at the speed of which the machine could pump out quarters.\n\nThe tour guide spoke up again, in his boring drone \"Did you know that Canada minted the first coloured coin in 2004, by adding a red poppy to the quarter. Any questions?\"\n\nThe tour guide scanned the crowd, and saw the same man raising his hand.\n\n\"Yes\" said the tour guide, with an exaggerated sigh.\n\nThe man, notably quite excited, asked \"So, why is there a moose on the quarter?\"\n\n\"I am, once again, not sure, please check our website for further information\" said the guide, in a very annoyed tone. \"Anything else?\"\n\n\nNo one said anything, but a majority of the tourists stared at a dusty old machine in the corner, covered in cobwebs.\n\n\"If any of you are wondering, that there is the penny machine. It has been out of service for quite a while now, ever since the penny was phased out\"\n\nAnd I dont have a stupid fact to go with it, thought the tour guide\n\n\"Any questions?\"\n\nThe guide eyed the crowd for 3 seconds, 5 seconds, and finally 10 seconds, with not a single hand raised.\n\nGlaring at the man at the back, the guide asked \"So, no questions about the maple leaf or anything, correct?\"\n\n\"Nope\" the man replied \"It all makes cents\"",

        "body": "A man was driving in the middle of nowhere down a secluded country road far from any cities. He got a flat tire, and got out to walk for help.After walking for some time, he came to a small stone monastery. He knocked on the door and roused the monks. \"I've got a flat tire. Can I use your phone?\" He asked. The monks said they were sorry, but they did not have a phone. \"If you stay tonight, you can get a ride on our wagon into town tomorrow,\" they said. So the man stayed the night, and they put him in a small room in the monastery. In the middle of the night, the man was awakened suddenly by a noise. Not just any noise, but the loudest, most wonderful, most terrifying, most hair-raising noise ever. He sat there, his heart beating for a few minutes, and he heard it again!Getting out of bed, he went running in the direction of the noise. It came again, making the hair on the back of his neck rise and his skin crawl. Finally, he came to a large door where the head monk was standing. The door was at least 15 feet tall, and made of solid-looking wood and metal. It had chains and bars and locks and a deadbolt on it, and was the most formidable door the man had ever seen. \"What was that sound?\" He asked. \"What made it? Is it behind that door?\" The head monk shook his head. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I can't tell you; you're not a monk.\" As the man turned away, he heard the noise again. \"You have to tell me what it is,\" he begged. \"I'm sorry, I can't tell you, you're not a monk,\" said the monk. The man tried to sleep, but couldn't get the noise out of his head. In the morning, as he was getting ready to leave, he heard the sound again. It made his ears ring and his mind whirl.\"Please tell me what made that sound,\" he said. But the monks wouldn't. \"I'm sorry, you're not a monk\" was all they said. The man left, and eventually got his car fixed and went back to his life. But he couldn't get the sound out of his mind. After a few months, he got in his car and drove and drove until he found the monastery again. He got out of his car and found the head monk. \"I can't forget that sound from that night I was here. Please, please please tell me what made that sound.\" The head monk just shook his head. \"I can't tell you; you're not a monk,\" he said.\"Then tell me how I can become a monk,\" the man said. The head monk said \"It's very difficult. Are you sure you want to do this?\"The man said \"I've got to. I have to know what made that sound.\"The head monk said, \"To join us, you have to perform several tasks. Your first task is to count all of the stars visible in the sky.\" The man thought about how hard that would be, but he had to know what made that sound. He sat up every night for a year, counting the stars over and over until he was sure how many stars were visible in the sky. He went to the head monk and told him, and the monk nodded. \"Very good. Your next task is to count all of the grains of sand on the beaches around the world.\"The man knew this would be even harder, but he could not get the noise out of his head. He had to know what, what kind of animal, could make that terrible horrible mind-bending sound. So he left on his journeys. He crawled the length and breadth of every beach in the world, counting the grains of sand, and he returned to the monastery years later.The head monk heard his answer and nodded. \"Excellent. You are almost done. Your final task is to climb to the peak of the highest mountain in the world, and see yourself in relation to the rest of creation.\" And the man knew this would be hard, but he outfitted himself, and he went to the highest mountain in the world, and he climbed to the top, and returned months later, older and wiser and more tired than years before when he had first heard the noise, the noise that would not leave his mind and that echoed in his every waking thought.He returned, and the head monk saw that he was wiser, and said \"At last, you are a monk. Come with me.\" And they walked through the monastery, its twisting and turning halls, and as they went the man heard the noise again, over and over, and he was no longer sure if it was the noise or merely his memory of it.And finally, finally, he stood in front of the door and the head monk opened it up, and the man saw what had made the noise. But, I can't tell you what it was. You're not a monk.",

He asks the security guard if he can ride it but the guard says no. After some more arguing he offers to pay the guard $2000 bucks to let him drive it. The guard says sure and Joe gets in. He starts driving around like a maniac, destroying half the convention. It runs out of gas and the cops arrest him. \n\nThree days later he pays all the fines, settles a lawsuit out of court and is free. On his way out the cop says to him \"Joe, you're a real nice guy but you really need to get this tractor obsession under control, it's ruining you.\"\n\nJoe realizes the cop is right, and when he gets home he throws out all his tractor stuff. Threw out his tractor calendar, put new wallpaper up over his tractor wallpaper, he deleted all his tractor simulators from steam and he started fresh. Life was great.\n\nA few years later he was in Ohio on business and having a drink in this shadey old bar. The bar was totally full of smoke and this bothered Joe. He asked the bartender to get rid of the smoke but the bartender just said \"well what do you want me to do about it buddy??\" So Joe got up, went to the window, breathed in a biiiiiig gasp of smoke and blew it all out the window. Suddenly all the smoke from the bar just rushed out the window and it was nice and clear again. \n\nJoe walked back to the bar and the bartender said \"How on earth did you do that?!?!\"\n\n\"Easy,\" said Joe, \"I'm an ex tractor fan.\"",

        "body": "A man named John lives in Texas near the Mexican border. He decides that life is, in fact, short, so he rents a Jeep to go offroading in the desert. Now John has been offroading for about two hours, when he goes over a dune at a bad angle, and rolls his Jeep onto the side.\nTo his horror, one of the fuel lines was severed in the process, and he has lost all of the fuel in his tank. John pulls his cell phone out of his pocket, and unfortunately does not have any service. Having planned on only a one day adventure, he failed to pack any more than two water bottles for his journey. \nJohn then decides that it is in his best interest to find a direction to go in, and stick with it. Having a couple empty bottles, he fills them with antifreeze from his engine, thinking that even though it is poisonous, it could still provide something to drink when he runs out of water.\nHe looks at the direction that he thinks that he came from, and heads straight out as the crow flies hoping to find some city. After the first day of hiking in the scorching desert sun, he finds to his horror, that he has drunken all of his limited water supply.\nHe settles down for the night, not knowing what the next day will bring. Waking up, he finds himself at the bottom of a particularly large dune, he decides to climb the dune to find his bearings and hopefully see a city. \nUpon reaching the top of the dune, he looks out and spots a very large black circle out in the middle of the desert, roughly 5 miles away. Feeling as parched as someone can feel, he looks down at one of his bottles of antifreeze and regretfully takes a sip.\nFeeling somewhat refreshed at just consuming some liquid, he sets off for the circle. The monotony of the desert seems to make time pass more slowly, and upon reaching the circle, he realizes to his horror that he has consumed half of the antifreeze.\nJohn then decides to lay down on the black slab of what he now realizes is a large, cool rock. Upon almost falling asleep he hears a voice call out, \"John\". He looks up, and notices a large rattlesnake coiled around a pole in the center of the slab of rock. Dismissing the call as a hallucination, he lies back down. The voice then calls out to him again, \"John!\" It proclaims. He looks up at the snake, and it opens its mouth and goes, \"there we are John! You've figured it out.\" \nDazed, John exclaims,\n\"How can a snake be talking to me?\"\n\"I am a magical snake!\" He replies,\n\"And welcome to the Garden of Eden.\"\nJohn, in utter disbelief, says,\n\"I must me hallucinating now!\"\n\"John, you are not hallucinating, and you are in fact within the Garden of Eden, or at least what is left of it. I am Nate, and I am in fact the snake that is portrayed to be Satan within the Bible.\"\n\"But how is this possible?\" John replies\n\"When I offered Eve what I am about to offer you now, she believed it was Satanic in nature, the Bible misinterprets our relations greatly.\"\n\"And what are you going to offer me?\"\n\"Three wishes, I offer them to anyone who passes through my garden, and I will offer them to you now, no questions asked, no tricks or gimmicks, only three wishes.\"\n\"First, I'm curious, what is the pole upon which you are coiled, and second, what would you recommend for wishes?\"\n\"I will tell you what the pole is once you have wished for your three wishes, and you are not in very good health, I would recommend that you wish for all of your ailments to be cured.\"\n\"Well that does seem like a good idea, I wish for all of my ailments and sicknesses to be cured.\"\nUpon wishing this, John immediately felt the results, it was as if all of the antifreeze and bacteria left his system instantaneously.\n\"Well, I can see that you feel much better. Now, you haven't eaten or drunken for many days, I would recommend that you wish for never having to suffer from thirst or hunger ever again.\"\nJohn replied, \"That sounds like a good idea, I wish that I shall never have to eat or drink again.\"\nAgain, as with the first wish, John felt the immediate results of being cured, and all of his hunger and thirst left his body.\n\"Good, good,\" Nate said, \"Now because the desert is a very dangerous place, I recommend that you wish to be immune from all injury.\"\nJohn quickly replies, \"I wish to never suffer from an injury again.\"\nAnd, again, all of John's scars, scabs, and any evidence he had ever been harmed disappeared immediately.\n\"Now a deal is a deal,\" John said, \"what is the pole you are coiled around?\"\n\"When God created the Earth,\" Nate replied, \"he gave me the responsibility of guarding the lever, which if pulled, will end all human life.\"\n\"Wow,\" John said, \"that must be a lot of responsibility, but I too have responsibilities, would you mind directing me in the direction of the nearest town?\"\nNate pointed his tail in a direction and said, \"30 miles that way is the nearest city, I wish you luck in finding your way home.\"\n\"Thank you for everything, Nate.\" John replied.\nJohn set off in the direction which Nate had directed him, making marathon like pace with his new powers.\nJohn soon arrived in the city, which not to his knowledge, was in fact the Mexican city of Ju\u00e1rez, and there was an ongoing war between the Mexican government and a drug cartel.\nJohn walks out into a street, and is shot by one of the members of a cartel, and he quickly ducks back into an alley. His wound heals quickly, and he is about to bolt out of the city when a hand reaches out of a door in the alley and pulls him into a building.\n\"The drug cartels have stolen all of our cars and placed the city on lockdown, we are unable to leave! We have seen your powers, and we would be forever grateful if you were to get us a van from one of their garages to help us leave.\" A woman says to John.\n\"Alright, I have an equal desire to leave the city as well, and I will attempt to get something to get us out of the city.\"\nJohn manages to make it the two blocks to the garage, and quickly hotwires a van. He makes his way back to the building and picks up the people who needed help. Upon attempting to pull away, he notices his route is blocked by multiple cartel Hummers. He turns around, and begins driving back into the desert from which he entered the city. Driving as fast as he can, he is unable to outrun the Hummers, who quickly close in on both sides, limiting his ability to turn. \nHe then begins to see the black slab off in the horizon, and notices that Nate has uncoiled himself from the pole, and is on the ground next to it. Not wanting to hit either of the things, John quickly decides on the lesser of the two evils and yells.\n\"BETTER NATE THAN LEVER!\"        ",

She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet.\nHer career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10.\nI'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her \"womanly\" parts.\nI think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store she moans like a cat in heat.\n\nBut the jewel in the crown has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead.\nIn fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work.\nHe probably hasn't been sober any time in the last ten years, and he's only 22.\nHe dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work.\nEvery fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke.\nHell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing.\nAlso, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonald's and Burger King, every single fucking day.\n\nAnyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.\n",

I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat\non my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that\nsomehow.\u201d\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201dAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago.

But before I could make it back to\nTampa . . .\u201d\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old\nman.\u201d\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my\nGod. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks\nall of his whiskey.\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201dAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and\nso his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just\ncollapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like\nhim.\u201d And he starts weeping.\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My\nlife was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind\nand you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you\nknow what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\nSo the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was\ngay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom,\nto give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.\nSo the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy\ncouple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d\nAnd then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective\nof his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things\ntoo far.\u201d\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s just grab a beer. It\u2019s on me.\u201d\n\nBy Simon Rich",

Here is an e-mail sent to Clarence Page of the Chicago Tribune after\nan article he published concerning a name change for the Washington  Redskins.\nThis guy is good\u2026\n\n\nDear Mr. Page:\nI agree with our Native American population.\nI am highly insulted by the racially charged name of the Washington Redskins.\nOne might argue that to name a professional football team after Native Americans\nwould exalt them as fine warriors, but nay, nay. We must  be careful not to\noffend, and in the spirit of political correctness and courtesy, we must move forward.\n\n    Let's ditch the Kansas City Chiefs, the Atlanta  Braves and the Cleveland\nIndians.  If your shorts are in a wad because of the reference the name\nRedskins makes  to skin color, then we need to get rid of the Cleveland Browns.\n     The Carolina Panthers obviously were named to keep the memory of militant Blacks\nfrom the 60's alive. Gone. It's offensive to us white folk.\n\n    The New York Yankees offend the Southern population. Do you see a team named for the\nConfederacy?  No!  There is no room for any reference to that tragic\nwar that  cost this country so many young mens' lives.\n\nI am also offended by the blatant references to the Catholic religion among our\nsports team names.  Totally inappropriate to have the New Orleans Saints,\nthe Los  Angeles Angels or the San Diego Padres.\n\nThen there are the team names that glorify criminals who raped and pillaged. We are\ntalking about the horrible Oakland Raiders, the Minnesota Vikings, the Tampa Bay\nBuccaneers and the Pittsburgh Pirates!\n\nNow, let us address those teams that clearly send the wrong message to our children.\nThe San Diego Chargers promote irresponsible fighting or even spending habits.\nWrong message to our children.\n\nThe New York Giants and the San Francisco Giants promote obesity,\na growing childhood epidemic.  Wrong message to our children.\n\nThe Milwaukee Brewers. Well that goes without saying.\nWrong message to our children.\n\nSo, there you go.  We need to support any legislation that comes out to rectify\nthis travesty, because the government will likely become involved with this\nissue, as they should.  Just the kind of thing the do-nothing Congress loves.\n\nAs a diehard Oregon State fan, my wife and I, with all of this in mind, suggest it\nmight also make some sense to change the name of the Oregon State women's\nathletic teams to something other than \"the Beavers (especially when they\nplay Southern California. Do we really want the Trojans sticking it to the Beavers???)\n\nI always love your articles and I generally agree with them.\nAs for the Redskins name I would suggest they change the name to\nThe \u201cForeskins\u201d to better represent their community,\npaying tribute to the dick heads in Congress.\n\nWhat's good for the Goose\nIs good for the Gander\nDon't ya think?",

The day came for the final test, which would determine which of equally qualified candidates, would get the job.\n\nThe final candidates consisted of two men and one woman. The men administering the test took the first candidate, a man, down a corridor to a closed door and handed him a gun saying, \"We must be completely assured that you will complete your assignments and follow instructions regardless of the circumstances. Inside this room you will find your wife, seated in a chair. Take this gun and kill her.\" The man, looking completely shocked said, \"You can't be serious!

Take your wife and go home.\" They brought the next candidate in, the other man, and repeated the instructions. This man took the gun, walked into the room and closed the door. However, after five minutes of silence, the door opened and the man handed the CIA tester the gun, saying, \"I just couldn't do it. I couldn't kill my wife. I tried to pull the trigger but I just couldn't do it.\" The CIA man said, \"Well, then, you're obviously not the man for the job.

Take this gun and kill him.\" The woman took the gun, walked into the room, and before the door closed all the way, the CIA men heard the gun start firing. One shot after another, for thirteen shots, the noise continued. Then all hell broke loose. For the next several minutes, the men heard screaming, cursing, furniture crashing and banging on the walls; then suddenly, silence. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, \"You guys didn't tell me the gun was loaded with blanks! I had to beat him to death with the chair!\"",

After his friends leave the man picks the bird up and yells \"why are you acting this way!?\" The bird lurches back at strikes out at the man; injuring him in a minor fashion.  The fellow grabs the bird and swings open the freezer door.  The parrot wrestling about and screaming the whole time.   He plunges the parrot into the freezer and slams the door while falling with his back against the freezer door in one motion.\n\nNOW THE PARROT IS FREAKIN OUT.   Buckling the fridge from side to side with its  rage fueled  flapping.  Suddenly, all at once, it stopped.  There was no flapping.. no screaming or swearing.  He opened the door slowly.  The parrot flies up and meets the mans hand with an innocent demeanor.  The parrot looks down for a moment.  Then speaks to the man.  \"Sir , I'd like to apologize, my manners have been awful & I have been so unappreciative.\". The man is shocked!  What has caused this drastic turn around?

Around the eight frame, the manager said, over the intercom, \"We'll be closing in ten minutes,\" but we figured we had enough time to finish our game.\n\nIn the ninth frame, he announced, \"Five minutes.  Please return your rental shoes ASAP,\" but we weren't quite done, yet, so we kept bowling.\n\nDuring the tenth (and final) frame, the manager started going from lane to lane, telling everybody to pack up and go home.\n\nWhen he was about eight lanes away, I rolled my first ball.  I hit the pocket pretty well, but only scored a nine; the 10 pin didn't fall.\n\nBy now the manager is about six lanes away, and I'm in a dilemma: because of the way bowling is scored, if you knock down all the pins in the final frame, you get an extra roll as a way to score more points.\n\nBut the manager is almost to our lane; if I knock down that last pin, he might kick us out before the pin-setter resets another rack.  But I don't want to miss, either...\n\nSo I look at how far away the manager is (four lanes, and getting closer) and I think about how long it will take to re-rack and bowl the bonus ball, and come to the conclusion that I *CAN* squeeze both rolls in before he shuts us down.\n\nAnd so, I say to my friends, \"I Have Time To Spare!\"\n\n(PS: Yes, it IS a true story.)",

Apparently he went there every opportunity he had. He couldn't get enough of that Bavarian cream pie - it was absolutely unreal.\n\nWell, a few years ago, my grandpa found out that he had a terminal illness, and only had a few months left to live. So, he booked a deluxe vacation cruise to Europe that would eventually take him to that little town in Germany with the famous Bavarian cream pie.\n\nA few weeks into the cruise, the ship started slowly sinking off of the coast of Portugal. I don't know if you remember that, but it was all over the news at the time. Well the life raft that my grandpa was in also turned out to be slowly leaking. So he helped all of the people that were in his life raft onto another one, but he wouldn't get on himself because it was already so overloaded. So, my grandpa, and I'm not making this up. This was in the news. My grandpa, at 84 years old, swims for over a mile in the Atlantic Ocean to the coast of Portugal.\n\nWater-logged and exhausted, he hitches a ride and gets dropped off about 100 miles outside his destination in Germany. Trying to cross a main highway, he gets clipped by the side mirror of a car, but not badly, and he manages to hitch another ride with some people headed for Germany.\n\nEventually he catches a bus and arrives in this little town in Germany that he remembered from his youth. He's thrilled to find the old restaurant that he'd loved so much 60 years ago, and he walks in and takes his usual seat at the table by the window. The waitress comes over and my grandpa says, (my grandpa spoke German fluently, by the way), he says, \"I know exactly what I want. You have no idea what I've had to go through to get here. I would love a nice big slice of your wonderful Bavarian cream pie.\"\n\nThe waitress says, \"Sorry, Sir - but we're all out of Bavarian cream.\"\n\nMy grandpa says, \"Apple's fine.\"",

Then, we will eat your flesh, use your bones for tools, and build a canoe out of your skins. However, I will grant you one act of mercy, by allowing you to chose the manner of your death.\"\n\nThe Frenchman goes first, and after careful contemplation, requests to die by a sword. He raises the sword, takes a breath and cries \"VIVE LA FRANCE!\" as he runs himself through. \n\nThe Brit goes next, and askes for a clean death by pistol. He loads the gun, puts the end of the barrel to his chin, shouts \"GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!\" and BAM! blows his brains out.\n\nThe American goes last, and after a moment's thought, asks for a fork. The cannibals are confused, but grant him his wish. The man proceeds to stab himself repeatedly in his arms, legs, chest, and face. The cannibals cry out \"Good heavens man, what are you doing?\" The American shouts: \n\"SO MUCH FOR YOUR FUCKIN CANOE!\"",

We went to the hottest strip clubs and got free lap dances, and I even had sex with a stripper onstage and nobody dared to fuck with me and my buddies! We were unstoppable!\"\n\nThe grandfather smiled as he reminisced, remembering fondly his days in Paris.  The younger man furrowed his brow and nodded.\n\n\"You know what grandpa?  You're right.  I do need to go out and do something with my life!  I'm gonna grab my buddies and go to Paris, and do the exact same things you did!\"\n\n\"Atta boy,\" the elderly man responded.\n\n\nTwo weeks later, the young man came home from Paris.  However, when the expectant grandfather opened the door, he found his grandson in a sling, a neckbrace, and with two horribly black eyes.\n\n\n\n\"What the fuck happened to you?!\" grandpa asked.\n\n\"I did all the same stuff you did!\" The man replied in dismay.  \"We went to the best clubs, drank up a huge tab, but when we tried to leave without paying, the bouncer beat the shit out of me and broke my arm!  We tried to push our way into a restaurant, but when we wouldn't leave the police were called and gave me these two black eyes with their night sticks!  And worst of all, we went to a strip club, and when I tried to fuck a stripper onstage, I was nearly beaten to death by all the bouncers at once!\"\n\n\"Who the hell did you go with?\" Asked the grandpa incredulously.\n\n\"A group of my buddies.

The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing.

To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction.\n    He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited $10.00.

In recent years, a new sub-species have been identified which is not native to the area around the Czech capitol. The research has been carried out with the help of many students and locals who have volunteered to contribute information about sightings and descriptions of these curious frogs, and upload this information to the research team's online catalog where it can be categorized and evaluated. This sort of grassroots (or perhaps toadstool) approach to data collection has been viewed by many skeptics as unorthodox, but it has yielded fast results. In the last few months, the team has been able to establish the spread of the new frogs throughout the surrounding community, but has yet to discover their origin or method of transportation.\n\n\"Frogs are not typically great migrators,\" says Professor Jacob Kroka, \"They require large amounts of water for breeding and for food supply purposes. They do not travel easily over dry or mountainous areas.\"\n\nProfessor Kroka has suggested that perhaps predatory birds are responsible for the introduction of the unidentified species into Prague's streams and ponds. \n\n\"Obviously we're not talking about sparrows here. It would have to be a large bird like a heron or pelican that feed at the waters edge. It seems unlikely, but possibly a few live frogs or perhaps some frog eggs escaped the meal and made it back into the ecosystem.\" Kroka continues, \"What I believe we have here is a hybridization of two species--one native and one from a neighboring area.\"\n\nEarly DNA results seems to corroborate Kroka's hybridization theory. While the two species that interbred have not been definitively identified, they have narrowed down the geographical scope. One of the parents, as per Kroka's suspicion, appears to be local. As for the other parent, Kroka states \"It seems from our DNA analysis that they are all a tad Polish.\"",

His gun looks like a dragon barking fire. He takes out 65 Zipper Heads before he runs out of bullets. Then he pulls out his machete and starts hacking precisely like a surgeon at the Gooks. He slaughters another 25 before his machete gets stuck in some poor bastard's head. Uncle Bob then balls up his fists and starts swinging at the remaining son's of bitches. He kills the final ten men with his bare hands.\"\n\nThe teacher looks quizzically at little Johnny and asks, \"So what's the moral of that story Johnny?\"\n\nJohnny replies, \"Don't FUCK with Uncle Bob when he's drunk.\"",

It won't happen again.\"\n\nThe farmer, angry but understanding, put out the fire, and walked off back to bed.\n\nThe next day, after tending to the fields, the young farmhand thought about the pile of straw again. \n\n\"I wish I could see it *all* on fire,\" he thought to himself.\n\nSo, later that night, he lit the pile on fire again.\n\nAgain, the farmer came running out, shocked by what he was seeing\n\n\"Sir, my lamp fell over, and spilled hot oil on the straw,\" the farmhand cried.\n\n\"Help me put this out, boy, and don't let it happen again, or you're done for,\" the farmer said.\n\nThe next day, the farmhand just couldn't help himself. He **had** to see that pile of straw burn in a blaze of glory. \n\nLate at night, in the early hours of the morning, the farmhand lit the pile of straw on fire. This time, the farmer was fast asleep, and didn't notice the inferno happening until nearly the entire pile had been incinerated. The farmer came running outside, where he found the farmhand standing next to the charred and completely straw-barren barn.\n\n\"That's the last straw, asshole.\"",

It is impossible to make a dishonest living these days.\"\n\nThe third thief shook his head just a little, as well, smiling softly at his friends from over his wine glass. \"It pains me to hear of your troubles, friends. Would you allow me to pick up the tab today?\"\n\nThe offer was met with grumbles and protests.\n\n\"How is it we're struggling to make ends meet, but you're here with your bottle of wine and your sly smile?\", they asked. \"Diamonds are worthless and secrets are whispered across the playgrounds, and yet here you are, hale and hearty!\"\n\nThe third thief rolled his shoulders in a shrug. \"Art,\" he said, simply.\n\n\"Art?\"\n\n\"Art. There is always a market for art. Art never goes out of style. Proceeds from gemstones are fleeting; cash garnered for information is as ephemeral as the goods you barter. You steal one fine painting, however, and the money will keep you for years and years. As simple as that.\"\n\nThe other two thieves muttered and grumbled again, exchanging glances of doubt and disbelief, until the third thief held his hands up to silence them. He leaned in, and his companions leaned in as well, to hear his wisdom.\n\n\"It is a lesson we all learned on the playgrounds of our youth,\" he says. \"...you know what they say: Take a picture.

If this Jew won, the Jews could stay.  If the Pope won, the Jews would have to leave.\n\nThe Jews realized that they had no choice.\n\nSo they picked an elderly aged man named Moishe to represent them.  Rabbi Moishe's Latin wasn't very good - in fact, he knew very little --- but he was a man of great faith and well respected in the Jewish community.\n\nThe pope agreed. What could be easier than a silent debate?\n\nThe day of the great debate came.\n\nMoishe and the Pope sat opposite each other for a full minute sizing up each other , before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.  Moishe looked back at him and raised one finger.\n\nThe Pope waved his fingers in a circle around his head. Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat.\nThe Pope pulled out a wafer and a glass of wine. Moishe pulled out an apple.\n\nThe Pope stood up and said, \"I give up. This man is just too good. The Jews can stay.\"\n\nAn hour later, the cardinals were all around the Pope asking him what happened.\n\nThe Pope said: \"First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity.  He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one God common to both our religions. \n\nThen I waved my finger around me to show him that God was all around us.  He responded by pointing to the ground and showing that God was also right here with us. \n\nI pulled out the wine and the wafer to show that God absolves us from our sins.  He pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin.\n\nHe had an instant answer for everything. What could I do?\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Jewish community had crowded around Moishe. \"What happened?\" they asked.\n\n\"Well,\" said Moishe, \"First he said to me that the Jews had three days to get out of here. I told him that not one of us was leaving. \n\nThen he told me that this whole city would be cleared of Jews. I let him know that we were staying right here.\"\n\n\"And then?\" prodded a Jewish woman.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Moishe. \"He took out his effin\u2019 lunch and so I took out mine.\"\n\n(Ps: Not mine, found in a text msg from a friend)",

Today I will bring you under such a strong hypnotism with this very watch that you will do whatever I say.\"\nAs he says this, he begins to swing the watch, letting the chain out gradually as it rocks back and forth. Under his soothing performance the crowd's heads begin to droop.  just as the crowd slips completely into the hypnotic state the hypnotist's hands slip on the watch and it drops to the floor, cracking the front plate.\n\"Shit!\" He mutters under his breath. \n\n\nIt took a month to clean that place up.",

All they had was this one milk cow. The would turn the milk to cheese and sell at the market to buy food.\n\nWell, one morning, the father wakes up and sees the milk cow dead. So he hangs himself in the tree.\n\nThe mother wakes up, sees the milk cow dead and her husband hanging from the tree and throws herself into the river and she washes up on the shore.\n\nThe oldest son wakes up, sees the milk cow dead, his father hanged and, by his mother who has washed up on the shore, a leprechaun - a female leprechaun.\n\nShe says \" Looks like you're having a bad day\". he say \"I should say so.\" She says \"i'll make you a deal, if you make love to me 10 times in a row, I'll bring your mom and dad back, and even the milk cow\".\n\nHe says \"why not?\". He almost makes it but fails, so she kills him.\n\nThe next son wakes up, sees the milk cow dead, his father hanging and his mother and brother dead by the shore near the leprechaun.\n\nShe tells him \"if you make love to me 10 times in a row, I'll bring you father, mother and brother back, and also the milk cow\". He agrees. He doesn't make it either, so the leprechaun kills him.\n\nThe youngest son wakes up, sees the milk cow dead, the father hanging from the tree, and his mother and two brothers dead by the shore, and the female leprechaun.\n\nShe tells him \"if you make love to me 10 times in a row, without stopping, I'll bring your father, mother and two brothers back, and even the milk cow\".\n\nHe says \"Well, look at you and look at me, I'm young and virile, let's try it. BUT, what if I make love to you 15 times in a row?\"\n\nShe says, \"In that case, I'll bring your father, mother and brothers back, even the milk cow and give you nice mansion where your hovel is\".\n\nHe says \"That's fine and all, but what if I make love to you 20 times in a row?\"\n\nShe says \"If you make love to me 20 times in a row, I'll bring your entire family back, even the milk cow, give you mansion where your hovel is and give you a big pot of gold and you'll be set for life\".\n\nHe says \"alright let's get started in a minute, but first, if I make love to you 20 times in a row, what's to stop YOU from dying? The milk cow did.\"\n\nAll credit goes to Darby O'Gill\nhere is a storyboard of the original telling of the joke: [the cow did](http://vimeo.com/109935412)\n",

He was not interested in having sex, doing yard work or much of anything.  \n  \nShe made an appointment for him to see a doctor.  In talking with the doctor, he is told that a much needed vacation is in order.  To go home and have his wife leave for a week and then come back.  That should give him all the alone time he needs to get back on track.  The man is excited and goes home to tell her the news.\n\n  She is willing to do whatever, so she packs a bag amidst him telling her to \u201churry the hell up and get out!\u201d  She quickly explains that she has made all of his meals and they are labeled in the refrigerator.  The dog food is also in the refrigerator and not to forget to feed the dog.  The man is in such a hurry doesn\u2019t listen and rushes her along.\n  \n  Soon after she is gone he gets hungry.  He goes to the fridge find some hamburger patties wrapped up ready to fry and makes him a hamburger.  Shortly after he starts to feel great, he cleans the whole house, the yard and works on several projects around the house.  He just can\u2019t seem to eat enough of those hamburgers.  \n\n  By weeks end she returns to find the house immaculate, the yard maintained and all of her projects done.  She asks him what has happened and he throws her on the bed and makes mad passionately love to her.  She is so swept away and in awe she can hardly contain herself.  He tells her about how the burgers she left for him made him a changed man.  \n\n   She doesn\u2019t understand and tells him that she left no burgers for him.  She goes to the fridge to find that all of the Gaines burger dog food is gone.  She tells him that he\u2019s been eating dog food.  The man doesn\u2019t care and continues to eat them.  \n\n   She calls the doctor and explains what is going on.  The doctor reassures her that if it has changed him and she likes it, not to worry about it.  The dog food won\u2019t hurt him.  \n\n   Two weeks later the woman calls the doctor again crying and sobbing, tells the doctor that her husband died.  The doctor said he cannot believe the man died from eating dog food?  She exclaims \u201cno he was in the middle of the road licking his dick and a truck ran him over!\u201d\n",

every important.\u00a0They are sitting at the kitchen table when the parents began to explain to him that sometimes two people who loved each other very much at one time can fall out of that love and they must get a divorce.\u00a0\u00a0They asked him if he understood and he said he did.\u00a0\u00a0He went to bed and the next morning he was very sick.\u00a0\u00a0His parents rushed him to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor came in and said \"I'm afraid there is nothing we can do, your son will die.\" So, the father goes in and he says to his son, \"What can I get you before you pass away?\"\u00a0\u00a0The son says to his father, \"I want one green golf ball.\"\u00a0\u00a0The father things green golf ball but he doesn't have time to really ask about it.\u00a0\u00a0He rushes out to the nearest store and gets his son one green golf ball.\u00a0\u00a0He takes it back to the hospital where he places it next to his son's bed.\u00a0\u00a0The next morning the boy is alive and well.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor releases him and he goes home.\u00a0\u00a0A number of years have passed now.\u00a0\u00a0The son is about to go to college.\u00a0\u00a0A very nice university actually, lots of activities, girls, and even a few guys for a possible experimentation phase but I digress.\u00a0He is moving into this dorm room when his parents sit him down and tell him how proud him they are and now that he won't be home as much they don't feel they can live together and they will be getting a divorce.\u00a0\u00a0The son says he understands and all go home to finish getting his stuff for his room.\u00a0\u00a0The next day the son is sick and they rush him to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor says to the parents, \"We've run all the tests and we are afraid your son will not make it.\"\u00a0\u00a0The father goes and asks the son, \"What can I get you before you pass away?\"\u00a0\u00a0The son says to his father, \"I want a bucket full of green golf balls.\"\u00a0\u00a0The dad thinks to himself, \"Those damn green golf balls again.\" But he doesn't think anything more of it.\u00a0\u00a0He rushes out to the nearest sporting store and purchases a bucket and fills it up with green golf balls.\u00a0\u00a0He hurries back to the hospital where he places the bucket next to his son's bed.\u00a0\u00a0The next day the boy is alive and well, then shortly released and goes back to college.\u00a0\u00a0He works very hard during his time there and decides to go into Law.\u00a0\u00a0He is now working as an intern at a prestigous law office in downtown Chicago,\u00a0\u00a0His parents come to visit him one weekend where he shows them the great work he is doing and how close he is to becoming a lawyer.\u00a0\u00a0After all this his parents set him down and explain to him how they have been living all these years in misery and how they must get this divorce.\u00a0\u00a0The son says he understands and they go back to his apartment.\u00a0\u00a0The next day the boy is very sick and he is rushed to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor is reviewing his charts and the new tests and said to the parents, \"I'm afraid there is nothing we can do for you son, he is going to die.\"\u00a0\u00a0The father goes in and asks his son, \"What can I get you before you pass away?\"\u00a0\u00a0The son's responese, \"I want I wheelbarrow full of green golf balls.\"\u00a0\u00a0The father rushes out and gets for his son this wheelbarrow full of green golf balls.\u00a0\u00a0He rolls up next to the bed and the next day the son is alive and well.\u00a0\u00a0He goes home and continues his work as an attorney.\u00a0\u00a0During this time he meets a beautiful young woman who he decides that he will marry.\u00a0\u00a0On the night of the rehearsal dinner everything is perfect.\u00a0His parents come up to him and father says, \"I see how much you love your fiance and those words mean so much to your mother and me.\u00a0However, we no longer feel that way towards one another and we are going to get divorced.\"\u00a0The son tells his parents that he understands and they go back to the hotel rooms.\u00a0\u00a0Overnight the son becomes very sick.\u00a0\u00a0They rush him to the hospital where the doctor comes up to the family and expresses his opinion and sorrow for their son's condition.\u00a0\u00a0He tells them he doesn't feel he will make it this time.\u00a0\u00a0The father goes into the room and asks his son, \"What can I get you befor you pass away?\"\u00a0\u00a0The son says to his father, \"I want one truckload of green golf balls.\" The father asks his friend to borrow his pick up truck and rushes out and fills it to the brim with green golf balls.\u00a0\u00a0He parks outside the window where his son can see the truck and its load of green golf balls.\u00a0\u00a0The son looks out his window and lays back down.\u00a0\u00a0The next day the son is well and alive and the wedding goes on.\u00a0\u00a0Years have passed, the son has children, and the parents are in their twilight years.\u00a0\u00a0They come to visit their son and grandchildren.\u00a0\u00a0While on the porch the father says to the son, \"You have a wonderful life with your own family and career now.\u00a0\u00a0Your mother and I aren't going to be around much longer and we don't want to live our lives in misery.\u00a0We MUST get divorced so we can be happy in these remaining years.\"\u00a0\u00a0The son says he understands and they all go in and head to bed.\u00a0\u00a0The next day the son is very ill.\u00a0\u00a0He is rushed to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor reviews all his records from the first incident to the last and says to the family, \"I'm sorry but he isn't going to make it.\u00a0\u00a0I don't care how many green golf balls this man gets.\"\u00a0\u00a0So, the father goes and says to his son, \"What can I get you before you pass away?\"\u00a0\u00a0The son responds with, \"I want two truck loads of\u00a0\u00a0green golf balls.\"\u00a0\u00a0The father rushes out and rents to huge semis and fills them both with green golf balls from the tri-state area.\u00a0\u00a0He brings the trucks back to the hospital where he parks them for the son to see.\u00a0\u00a0He raises his head and lays back down.\u00a0The next day the son is no better.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone is crying and the father goes and asks his son, \"Before you go I need to know why all these years did you want green golf balls?\"\u00a0\u00a0The son raises his head and says to his father,\"Because, because, because.....\" and then he dies.\u00a0\u00a0--- You have

A little while later a bear came out of the tree line on the other side of the river. The hunter pulled up his gun and put the sights on the bear. Just as he did this a really large water fly started hovering in his line of sight. He thought angrily to himself that fly better drop out of sight quick.\n\nAs this occurred there was a mouse eye balling the hunters lunch. The mouse said to itself, if that fly just dropped 6in the hunter would get a shot, would jump in his boat, and forget his lunch.\n\nSimultaneously, a hawk was watching the mouse from a tree high above. The hawk said to itself, if the fly dropped 6in the hunter would get a shot, jump in his boat, forget his lunch, and the mouse will come out from undercover.\n\nAlso, while this was occurring, a bobcat was monitoring the same situation. The bobcat said to itself that if the fly dropped 6in the hunter would get a shot, jump in his boat, forget his lunch, and the mouse will come out from undercover.\n\nWell, the fly finally dropped 6in and the hunter took his shot, jumped in the boat, and forgot his lunch. Once the shore was clear the mouse charged the lunch, the hawk swooped, and as the cat pounced the hawk swiped the mouse, and the Bob cat flew into the river.\n\nThe moral of the story is, when the fly drops 6in the pussy gets wet.\n\nEdit: typing that out on a phone; not so bright.",

I'm not sure the tax office finds that believable.'\n\n'I'm a great gambler, and I can prove it,' says Grandpa. 'How about a demonstration?'\n\nThe taxman thinks for a moment and said, 'Okay. Go ahead.'\n\nGrandpa says, 'I'll bet you a thousand pounds that I can bite my own eye.'\n\nThe taxman thinks a moment and says, 'It's a bet.'\n\nGrandpa removes his glass eye and bites it.

He starts to get nervous.\n\n'Want to go double or nothing?', Grandpa asks? 'I'll bet you six thousand pounds that I can stand on this side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.'\n\nThe taxman, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there's no way this old man could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.\n\nGrandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can't make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much pees all over the taxman's desk.\n\nThe taxman leaps with joy, realising that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win.\n\nBut Grandpa's own accountant moans and puts his head in his hands.\n\n'Are you okay?', the taxman asks.\n\n'Not really,' says the accountant.

Now he needed to get some farm animals.\n\nHe was new to this, so he decided to walk down the long gravel road to visit his neihbors who were all farmers and see if he could purchas a few animals to get him started.\n\nHe came to the first farm on his left, walked up the dirt driveway and greeted the farmer. He told him he wanted to buy a rabbit. The farmer looked at hime and replied \"Around here we don't call them rabbits, we call them Peter cotton tails\" or you can just call them a \"Peter\" for short.\n\nHe thanked him for letting him know and then said he wanted to buy a Peter if the farmer had one he could sell him. The farmer said he would be more than glad to sell him one, stuck a deal, and the city slicker continued down the gravel road on to another farm with his rabbit under one arm.\n\nThe city slicker comes to the next farm, walks up the dirt driveway again, looks around for the farmer, then tells him he is looking to purchase a hen. The farmer replied \"Around here we don't call them hens, we call them pullets\".\n\nThe city slicker thanked the farmer, then said he would like to purchase a pullet if he could from the farmer. The farmer said he has plenty to spare and would be glad to sell him one.\n\nThey struck a deal and the city slicker was on his way again down the gravel road, now with one peter and one pullet under each arm.\n\nHe reached the last farm on the end of the road, walked up to the farmer and told him he was interested in purchasing a mule, and asked if he had one he could sell. The farmer replied \"Around here we don't call them mules, we call them Ass's\".\n\nAgain, the city slicker thanked the farmer and said he would like to purchase an Ass if he had one he could spare.\n\nThe farmer said he had only one he could spare, and that is was a hard working Ass, but he did have a catch. The city slicker was a little concerned and asked what was wrong with the Ass. The farmer said the mule will be working and pulling nice and hard, and then suddenly stop dead in his tracks, BUT all you had to do was scratch him behind his ear, and he would go right back to work.\n\nThe city slicker thought that was no real big deal and that he could easily handle that. So city slicker struck up a deal with the farmer and decided to head home with a cock under his right arm, a pullet under his left arm, and the Ass walking beside him.\n\nHe was almost home when the Ass stopped dead in his tracks right in front of a lady working in her flower garden along the road.\n\nThe city slicker looked a little distressed, so the lady asked if she could help him. He replied.......\"Could you hold my peter and pullet while I scratch my Ass?\" ",

Some buffets use this thing called Mono Sodium Glutamate (MSG), a food additive that makes the food even more delicious. Used in correct amounts it just adds flavor. But used in incorrect amounts, a  process called \u201cre-animation\u201d can occur. Studies show that large amounts of (MSG) can stimulate the nervous systems of dead animals, even with the heads removed. In 2007 there was a tragic re-animation case that occurred in a Boise Chinese buffet called\u201c Hung Far Low\u201d. A family of four was attending the buffet after a Sunday service, when re-animation occurred suddenly and with extreme lethality. The mother sat down with some Mongolian beef on her plate, and started to gorge, when the beef attacked. According to eye witnesses, it happened so quickly the poor woman didn\u2019t have a fighting chance. Multiples pieces of Mongolian beef lunged at the woman, knocking her off her chair. She tried to get up but the beef was to strong. Her husband and some other bystanders tried to knock the beef off of her, but it was to quick and evaded them. The husband was only able to grab a single piece of beef and smash it with a plate, before zombie beef still in serving trays, started to re-animate. Then the shock and awe turned into complete pandemonium. The Mongolian beef swarmed out of the serving trays and started wriggling their way towards the already incapacitated lady. Some beef pieces grabbed plastic knifes as they left the buffet area, and when they reached the woman, they started sawing off the woman\u2019s feet. But that wasn't the cause of death the autopsy report says. The cause of death was asphyxiation. Over seventy five pieces of Mongolian beef had forced their way down the woman's throat.

The bad news is that it will require castration.\"\n\n\"You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine, and the pressure creates these serious headaches you've been experiencing. So the only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.\" \n\nJerry was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for. He couldn't concentrate long enough to answer, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife. \n\nWhen he eventually left the hospital Jerry was pleasantly surprised at how good it felt not to have a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he also knew that he was missing an important part of himself. \n\nAs he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a fresh start and live a new life. He saw a men's clothing store and thought to himself a new suit would be the perfect thing to mark this new beginning. \n\nHe entered the shop and told the salesman: \"I'd like a new suit.\" \nThe elderly tailor eyed him briefly and said: \"Let's see... size 44 long?\" \n\"That's right, how did you know?\" said Jerry, laughing. \n\n\"I've been in the business 60 years!\" replied the tailor. \n\nJerry tried on the suit and it fitted like a glove. As Jerry admired himself in the mirror, the salesman \nasked: \"How about a new shirt?\" \n\nJerry thought for a moment and then agreed. \nThe salesman eyed Jerry again. \n\n\"Let's see... 34 sleeve and 16-and-a-half neck?\" \n\nOnce again, Jerry was surprised. \n\"That's right, how did you know?\" \n\n\"Like I said, I've been in the business 60 years!\" \n\nSo Jerry tried on the shirt, and it was a perfect fit. As Jerry adjusted the collar in the mirror, the salesman asked: \"How about new shoes?\" Jerry was on a roll and so thought, why not? \nSo the salesman eyed Jerry's feet and said: \"Let's see... you must be a size nine-and-a-half?\" \n\nJerry was astonished. \"That's right, how did you know?\" \n\"Well, young fella, I've been in the business long enough to know these things!\" \n\nJerry tried on the shoes and they were also a remarkable fit. Jerry walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked: \"So that only leaves the new underwear. How about it?\" \n\nJerry thought for a second and agreed. \nThe salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said: \"Let's see... size 36.\" \n\nJerry laughed. \"Ah ha! I got you! I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old.\" \nThe salesman shook his head. \"There's no way. I'm never wrong. You can't wear a size 34.\" \n\n\"Oh yes I can,\" replied Jerry and have been most of my life. \n\"I don't understand,\" said the tailor. \"By my reckoning a 34 underwear would press your testicles up \nagainst the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache.\"",

You have a new disease that's just starting to spread in this country. It's called 'Hong Kong Dong.'\" \nThe man gulped. \"What do you do for it? Is there a cure?\"\n \"Well, sort of. You see, there is no way to cure the disease, but you must have an operation.\"\n \"An operation? What kind of operation?\" \"We cut off your penis.\" \"Wow! Do you mind if I get a second opinion?\" \nThe doctor replied, \"Of course not. In something of such a serious nature as this, I think you should get a second and a third opinion!\" The man consulted a urologist who told him essentially the same story, diagnosis, prognosis, and recommended treatment. He was understandably upset, so he asked the second doctor to recommend another doctor for his third opinion. The urologist suggested that, since this disease originated in the Far East that he travel there, as the Asian doctors might know more about it. Mr. Unlucky promptly booked passage on an airline for Hong Kong, where he received an immediate consultation with that Crown Colony's most eminent physician. After a series of tests, he awaited the verdict. The doctor entered the examining room.\n \"Well, is it Hong Kong Dong?\" he inquired, unable to wait.\n \"Yes.\"\n \"And is it really incurable?\"\n \"Yes, there is no known cure.\" \nThe man's face crumpled as he fought back tears. \"And am I going to have an operation? Will they have to cut off my penis?\" \nAt that the man was astonished to see the doctor break into laughter. \"What's so funny, Doc? You mean I don't have to have surgery?\" \nAs the doctor regained control of himself, he managed to choke out, \"Oh, those American doctors! Cut, clamp, sew! Surgery, surgery, all they can think of is surgery!\"\n \"I don't have to have my penis cut off?\" The man was overjoyed. \n\"Of course not!

Holy moley! How you've been, man? Great to see you! When you coming by the White House again?\" Mike's jaw drops. Once again, he listens to the POTUS and Dave chat and laugh. POTUS fist pounds Dave, says goodbye, and walks off.\n\n\"You know the President!?\" Mike asks in total disbelief. \"Of course,\" Dave answers, \"I never told you that?\" So of course, Mike starts questioning Dave about it. How did they meet, where, when, etc. Suddenly, Dave apologizes and says, \"Mike, it's been good hanging out and everything but I gotta run. I've been invited by the pope to go hang out in the Vatican.\" Mike is understandably confused and doubtful.\n\n\"Ok, I can accept that you know both the president and the PM, but there's no way you know the Pope. That's impossible,\" Mike says. \"It's true. We're old friends. In fact, I'll prove it. I'm allowed to bring a friend to Italy with me. Come along and I'll show you.\"\n\nSo Mike and Dave head over to Vatican City and Dave tells Mike to wait in the crowd in St. Peter's Square while the Pope does the Angelus prayer, the prayer he does every sunday at noon from his balcony. So Mike waits and keeps checking his watch, but begins to wonder where Dave went. Suddenly, chimes start ringing. 12 rings later, it's noon, and out steps the Pope, and would you believe that, to his side, is Dave! Mike nearly faints. The crowd is going crazy.

So the zoo owner asks one of his workers to wear a gorilla suit they have in storage for an extra $100 a day if he will go in the gorilla cage and pretend to be the gorilla until the zoo can afford a new one.\nQuickly, the new \"gorilla\" becomes the most popular craze at the zoo.

So, to get peoples' attention back, he decides to climb over his enclosure and hang from the net ceiling above the lions den next to him. \nA large crowd of people gather watching the spectacle in awe and horror. Suddenly the man loses his grip and falls to the floor of the lions den. The man starts screaming \"HELP!!

Outside, the other firemen watched as the Norwegian old timers jumped off right in the middle of the fire fought it back on all sides.  It was a performance and effort never seen before.\n \nWithin a short time, the Norske old timers had extinguished the fire and had saved the secret formulas. The grateful chemical company president announced that for such a superhuman feat he was upping the reward to $200,000, and walked over to personally thank each of the brave fire fighters.\n \nThe local TV news reporter rushed in to capture the event on film, asking their chief, \"What are you going to do with all that money?\" \n \n\"Vell,\" said Ole Larsen, the 70-year-old fire chief, \"Da first thing ve gonna do is fix da brakes on dat focking truck!",

Can you please fix it?\" He says, \"What do I look like, Bob Vila?\" The next day the husband comes home, and the roof is fixed. So is the plumbing. So is the car. He asks his wife what happened. \"Oh, I had a handyman come in and fix them,\" she says. \"Great! How much is that going to cost me?\" he snarls. Wife says: \"Nothing. He said he'd do it for free if I either baked him a cake or slept with him.\" \"Uh, well, what kind of cake did you make?\" asks the husband. \"What do I look like,\" she says, \"Betty Crocker?\"",

Yes favors, let's go with that.\" When the president was asked about why he didn't veto the bill he said \"I understand how this is a huge concern among my fans er American people, and want to better reflect how I the popular, er president would be willing to accommodate. Perhaps we can use this to move towards a brighter future of political conduct such as how long, er any given president should be in term. Further.. huuuh... what does the prompter say it turned off. Oh there it goes. Further we want to make sure that everyone is as happy as they can be with our policies.\n\n\nCertain items pertaining to the project funds were specified to be used including but not limited to: \n*moon dust converting to water\n*targeting systems with several tetrameters of reach with accuracy\n*moon dust converting to \"what whales breath if not water\"\n*machines to monitor money transactions on a global scale\n*moon dust converting to \"what whales eat if not water\"\n*machines to scan people's voting records on a global scale to determine statistics and effect voting fraud.\nand many more.\n\nIt's about time government realized that the NASA program needed to have a better budget, and I as I non inspecting reporter feel perfectly fine with the potential changes that can occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They take a cab across town and arrive at the meeting hall. Inside  are dozens of tables with people drinking and eating, and generally having a good time.\n\nJake a Dave settle in at a table and order another beer. At the front of the hall is a podium with a man standing behind it, and the man announces that is it now time to bring the meeting to order. He discusses club business for a few moments, and finally asks who would like to be first tonight.\n\nA man at another table volunteers and heads for the podium. He clears his throat, leans down to the microphone, and whispers \"783!\".\n\nThe crowd laughs hysterically!\n\nA woman then steps behind the podium, smiles, and says \"159?\". \n\nAgain, the crowd breaks into laughter.\n\nThis goes on for a while, until Dave turns to Jake and asks what is going on. Jake explains that this is an old club. Many of the members have been here for years, and most have the jokes have been told time and again. So, to make things a little easier, and to move things along a little bit, all the jokes have been numbered.\n\nDave is astounded. He has never heard of such a thing. Jake assures him it is true, and suggest Dave try telling a joke. Dave is reluctant, but Jake convinces him to try number 232.\n\nDave steps up to the podium. He looks up at the crowd nervously. He grins and says \"232!!\". \n\nThe hall is dead quiet. Dave sheepishly heads back to his table, and another person heads to the podium to tell a joke.\n\nDave quietly whispers to Jake \"What happened?\" Jake whispers back \"You told it wrong!\".",

The penalty is determined by the peoples emotion*. 3.What the peoples emotions is dictated by the Gauleiter(governor).

The nazis used this as an excuse for mob violence agains Jews in the early days)\n\n* The mayor of a small rural town is ordered to identify the local communists.

The tell him: \"Communists are people who don't want to work but expect to earn a lot.\" The mayor answers: \"Well, we got two of those: the preacher and the teacher.\"(1933)\n\n* \"The government just bought the Sahara?\" - \"Why?\" - \"So they can cast more sand into peoples eyes.\" (sand in the eyes = to pull the wool over ones eyes) (1938)\n\n* There can't be any elections in the forseeable future. - Why? - There was a break-in at the ministry of propaganda and the result for the next elections have been stolen from Goebbels desk.\n\n* The F\u00fchrer always keeps his promises. He promised us work and bread - he didn't say anything about butter.\n\n* A man wants to buy a pig from a farmer, but he says it has to be an aryan pig. \"What's that?\", the farmer asks. \"Well\", the man answers. \"It has to have bristles like Hitler, a snout like Goebbels and a belly like G\u00f6ring!\" (1934)\n\n* At a press meeting Goebbels tells an American journalist: \"If Roosevelt had something like the SS, there wouldn't be any Gangsters left in the US!\" The yournalist answers: \"Of course not.

Sorry but I didn't know who else to ring, a pipe has broke in your brother's house and it's flooding.\"\n\nSee my brother lives in Wales but was on holiday in Spain and his neighbour had no way to contact him. \n\nSo I said, \"Well the only person who has a key is his daughter who works in London, I'll give her a ring and she'll drive up as soon as she can.\"\n\nBut here's the thing, his daughter works in a phone sex centre!

I've got some bad news, a pipe has broken in your dad's house and it's flooded.'\n\n'Oh my god!'

        "body": "This memo is to announce the development of a new firm-wide software system. We are currently building a data center that will contain all firm data that is Year 2000 compliant. The program is referred to as the \"Millennia Year Application Software System \" (MYASS). Next Monday at 9:00 there will be a meeting in which I will show MYASS to everyone. We will continue to hold demonstrations throughout the month so that all employees will have an opportunity to get a good look at MYASS. As for the status of the implementation of the program, I have not addressed the networking aspects so currently only one person at a time can use MYASS. This restriction will be removed after MYASS expands. Several people are using the program already and have come to depend on it. Just this morning I walked into a subordinate's office and was not surprised to find that he had his nose buried in MYASS. I've noticed that some of the less technical personnel are somewhat afraid of MYASS. Just last week, when asked to enter some information into the program, I had a secretary say to me \"I'm a little nervous, I've never put anything in MYASS before. \" I volunteered to help her through her first time and when we were through she admitted that it was relatively painless and she was actually looking forward to doing it again. She went so far as to say that after using SAP and Oracle, she was ready to kiss MYASS. I know there are concerns over the virus that was found in MYASS upon initial installation, but I am pleased to say the virus has been eliminated and we were able to save MYASS. We planned this database to encompass all information associated with the business. So as you begin using the program, feel free to put anything you want into MYASS. As MYASS grows larger, we envision a time when it will be commonplace to walk by an office and see a manager hand a paper to an employee and say \"Here, stick this in MYASS \". This program has already demonstrated great benefit to the company during recent OSHA and EPA audits. After requesting certain historical data the agency representatives were amazed at how quickly we provided the information. When asked how the numbers could be retrieved so rapidly our Environmental Manager proudly stated \"Simple, I just pulled them out of MYASS.\"",

French isn't really in season right now.\"\n\nSo the two vampires make their way to Venice. They arrive late at night and look for good spot to stake out their victims. They settle on top of a building overlooking a bridge in order to have an easy way to dispose of the remains of their feast. It isn't long before they spot a couple crossing the bridge. Parched from their journey they swoop down on the couple and quickly drain them and toss the bodies over the side of the bridge. \n\n\"Oh, that was excellent\" the first vampire remarks. \"Italian was a great choice.\"\n\n\"I don't know about you, but I am ready for a second course\" the second vampire says.\n\nStill hungry from the journey, the first vampire agrees and they return to the building overlooking the bridge. After a few minutes they see another couple crossing the bridge. Just as before the vampires swoop down on the couple. They grab the couple, drain them, and toss the bodies over the bridge.\n\n\"The second course was even better than the first!\" the second vampire exclaims. \n\n\"I think I am up for just one more course. Care to join me?\" the first proposes.\n\nEager for another taste of Italian food, the two return to the rooftop and wait for another couple to cross the bridge. Their wait is not long and the vampires once again grab, drain, and toss the bodies over the bridge. After they tossed the bodies the first vampire pauses.\n\n\"Do you hear that?\"\n\n\"Hear what?\n\n\"It sounds like there is music coming from under the bridge.\"\n\n\"Who cares. I don't know about you, but I'm ready for dessert.\"\n\nBegrudgingly, the first vampire returns with the second to the roof. It seems within seconds a couple appears. The vampires swoop down, grab, and drain the couple, although a little more slowly this time as they are getting quite full. Once the couple is drained they toss the bodies over the bridge and they both agree that they couldn't swallow another drop. As they go to leave the first vampire pauses again.\n\n\"What is it now?\" the second asks, slightly exasperated.\n\n\"It is that music again\" he replies. \"You can't tell me that you can't hear it. It is getting louder now.\"\n\nThe second pauses to listen.\n\n\"Actually I can hear it now.\"\n\nThe two vampires walk to the side of the bridge and look down into the water. In the water they see a crocodile singing.\n\n*\"Drained [wops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wop) keep falling on my head\"*\n\n---\n\n**Ninja edit:** I included the wikipedia entry for wop in case people didn't get it.",

It says this is the 'No Bear Beer Bar'. We serve beers, but not to bears...so beat it.\" The bear, a little shocked from the abruptness of the bartender gets a little flummoxed, but stands his ground. \"Yeah, I'm a bear. Do you see how big I am? Do you see how big my teeth and claws are?  I demand a beer. I had a long day. I'm tired, I'm thirsty, & I want a goddamn beer right now!\" The bartender looks the bear straight in the eyes and says, \"No... Bear... Beer... Bar... No!\" The bear, getting angry now, looks around. He sees a lady sitting at the bar's end, with a couple of lumberjacks, giggling away. He returns the bartender's stare, and growls back, \"Do you see that lady sitting over there? If you don't give me a beer, I'm going to go eat her. Now give...me... a... beer!!\"  The bartender cooly says, \"No bears get beers in the No Bear Beer Bar.\" So the Grizzly, now thoroughly pissed off at this blatant discrimination, lumbers over to the lady, & because of his huge size, swallows her whole. Then he walks back up to the bartender, and before he can say anything, the bartender says \"No druggies allowed either, now get out!\" This new attack stops the bear in his tracks.  \"Druggies? What the hell are you talking about?\" The bartender replies, \"That was a barbitchyouate, bear. Now beat it.\" \nThe bear, defeated, slowly exits the bar. Heading back out into the blazing sun, with the bar bitch upsetting his stomach. He heads off into the woods, and a few minutes later feels like he has to take a massive shit. He settles in and just starts to paint the plants all around him.  The cacophony of his dilemma can be heard for a few hundred yards away. Finally, as he clears out the remnants of a dismal day, he looks over to see a terrified rabbit crouching behind a small shrub frozen with fear while also trying to take a dump.  So the bear asks, \"Hey pal. Do you have a problem with shit sticking to your fur?\" The rabbit a little nervously replies , \"Um, no. Not really.\" So the bear wipes his ass with the rabbit. ",

The mayor or Vienna was stumped on how to exterminate such a large quantity of rats, so he broadcast over the radio, that anyone able to get rid of all the rats, would be rewarded 1 million shillings. Straight away the inventors of the town got to work, and after a week, an old man came forth to the mayor, to show him his invention, the mayor was delighted and asked to see the invention in use, so the old man pulled a green wind up mouse out of his pocket and began winding it up. The old man then placed the green rat on the ground and it began jumping up and squeaking, almost immediately the roads turned black, and all the rats of Vienna began chasing after the green wind up mouse. The old man picked the mouse back up and threw it into the lake, as the rats followed they all drowned in the water, and the rat crisis was resolved. The mayor came over to the old man and gave him his 1 million shillings, and asked him, \"so is there any chance you can make a green wind up Jew?\". \n ",

And that once his attention was well and truly focused on them, He would likely sense the presence of the Ring and be able to take action against them, like flying Nazgul or arrows or fireballs or any number of crazy evil magical spells? And that even if Frodo and the Bird Brigade were able to get past whatever Sauron would throw at them and get into Mordor, they would be flying straight into a very active volcano spewing smoke and ash everywhere, screwing with visibility and trajectory and making it like trying to drop a penny onto the roof of an apartment building in the middle of a heavy fog from a biplane that's currently on fire?

After that it's all you, cowboy.\n\n\n\n Stare at her\n\nThis has never failed to this day:\n\nApproach the woman while staring straight at her (so that she can see you coming). Do not look away, even if she stares at you. Tell her this when you reach her:\n\n\"You look like someone that I would like to meet.\"\n\nHere are some responses I had while doing this pickup line:\n\n\"That's a nice thing to say.\"\n[A smile]\n\"What's your name?\"\n\"OK [with a smile]\"\n\nUsually, women don't know how to answer this so they are most likely to welcome your presence. \n\n\n\n Call her sexy\n\nThis one is a bit on the not-so-classy side, but it still works, to a certain extent. The problem with this line is that it\u2019s too blatant. It comes across as a bit pushy and even rude \u2013 depending on how you pull it off. So here it goes:\n\n\"Hey girl, why you being all sexy 'n shit?\"\n\nI would definitely try and \"swag\" up the presentation of the line with a nice smile and a slightly cocky but confident flair. With this line I was able to pull some 10's -- and one 10 I actually ended up dating for a while. Girls were somehow intrigued by it, baffled and flattered at the same time. It causes a mix of emotions, but there\u2019s definitely a lot of banter in this one.\n\n\n\n Make her laugh\n\nPickup line that paid off in two ways:\n\nMy dad always said that if you can make both guys and girls laugh, then you\u2019re funny. At first this seemed bizarre, but it landed up being completely true. The great thing is that you don\u2019t actually need anyone to tell you that you\u2019re funny or not. It\u2019s pretty obvious; you either make people laugh, or you don\u2019t. \nPersonally, I know I make people laugh \u2013 but not from crude or childish jokes. The best type of comedy comes from quick-witted, intellectual, and sometimes sarcastic, or satirical conversation. With this being said, making a woman laugh can relate to anything in the moment. Your options are endless. Whether it\u2019s a witty comment, or a good old fashioned story, getting a woman to laugh definitely scores you the brownie points.\n\n\n\n Make eye contact\n\nWhenever my wingman, Cairo, and I were out on a hunt, we would always have our eyes open for ladies who were either staring at us or looked as if they were making comments about us. For example;\nThe two of us are walking in a crowded area at a social event and Cairo overhears two girls walking past us. I\u2019m the furthest from the two girls so I don\u2019t even know they\u2019re looking at me. Cairo tells me that one of the girls said: \u201cOh my God that guy is f**king hot\u201d. As soon as he tells me this, we turn around and head for them. I tap the girl \u2013 whom Cairo noticed \u2013 on her shoulder and say:\n\u201cYou were totally checking me out! I saw you!\u201d\n\nNow, I know that sounds like an epic fail, but 100% of the ladies who were actually checking me out either laughed or started a conversation. And it all ends with someone buying drinks.    \n\n\n\n  Be sarcastic\n\nIt's fun to make eye contact, check her out from head to foot, showing some surprise at her \"feather colouring,\" and ask simply, \"So your favourite colour is red right?\" Obviously you have to get a dig at her by implying she\u2019s only wearing one colour or a dominant colour. Most women catch the ball and a very good conversation follows. The usual answer is \"Can't you tell?\" or she just plays along with you.\n\n\n\n  Show off\n\nThis is a very tricky one to pull off. Some girls like the badass attempt; others find it extremely off putting. The important thing is to know the difference between show boasting and putting your ass on a throne. Almost all girls I\u2019ve met regard arrogant guys and assoles as the same thing.\n\n\n\n Find something you have in common\n\nI don\u2019t use this one as often as the other options, but it works quite often. \n\nFor example, \"I have those exact same shoes!\" The ice is broken with a smile and a laugh. I like to think it works because it simultaneously tells the girl that I notice something specific about her attire and shows it to her with a well-balanced delivery of cockiness and playful insult.\nIf you get a look from her that suggests she thinks you\u2019re gay, I\u2019d say you just went into the friendzone with impeccable timing.\n\n\n\n Be a gentleman\n\nTotal truth: Introduce yourself as a perfect gentleman (I call it the simple approach), buy her a drink (her choice) and make small talk to see if there is a spark of interest.\nSmall things like pulling her chair for her (if you are going to sit down together), covering your mouth when you cough, and presenting yourself as if you show the utmost respect for yourself can already separate you from the competition. \n\n\nGO TO http://www.pickuptonight.com to see the number 1 way to introduce yourself!\n",

We\u2019re thinking of going to a sex therapist\u201d, said Linda. \u201cOh, we could never do that! We\u2019d be too embarrassed!\u201d, responded Mary. \u201cBut after you go, will you please tell me how it went?\u201d\n\nSeveral weeks passed, and the two friends met for lunch again. \u201cSo how did the sex therapy work out, Linda?\u201d, Mary asked. \u201cThings couldn\u2019t be better!\u201d Linda exclaimed. \u201cWe began with a physical exam, and afterward the doctor said he was certain he could help us. He told us to stop at the grocery store on the way home and buy a bunch of grapes and a dozen donuts. He told us to sit on the floor nude, and toss the grapes and donuts at each other. Every grape that went into my vagina, John had to get it out with his tongue. Every donut that I ringed his penis with, I had to eat. Our sex life is wonderful, in fact it\u2019s better than it\u2019s ever been!\u201d\n\nWith that endorsement Mary talked her husband into an appointment with the same sex therapist. After the physical exams were completed the doctor called Mary and Tom into his office. \u201cI\u2019m afraid there is nothing I can do for you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut doctor,\u201d Mary complained, \u201cyou did such good for Linda and John, surely you must have a suggestion for us! Please, please, can\u2019t you give us some help? Any help at all?\u201d \u201cWell, OK,\u201d the doctor answered. \u201cOn your way home, I want you to stop at the grocery store and buy a sack of apples and a box of Cheerios.\u201d\n\nhttp://nookbank.com/jokes",

English muffins weren't invented in England or French fries in France. Sweetmeats are candies while sweetbreads, which aren't sweet, are meat.\n\nWe take English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig.\n\nAnd why is it that writers write but fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce and hammers don't ham? If the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn't the plural of booth beeth? One goose, 2 geese. So one moose, 2 meese? One index, 2 indices?\n\nDoesn't it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend, that you comb through annals of history but not a single annal? If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them, what do you call it?\n\nIf teachers taught, why didn't preachers praught? If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat? If you wrote a letter, perhaps you bote your tongue?\n\nSometimes I think all the English speakers should be committed to an asylum for the verbally insane. In what language do people recite at a play and play at a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo by ship? Have noses that run and feet that smell? Park on driveways and drive on parkways?\n\nHow can a slim chance and a fat chance be the sanme, while a wise man and wise guy are opposites? How can overlook and oversee be opposites, while quite alot and quite a few are alike? How can the weather be hot as hell one day and cold as hell another.\n\nHave you noticed that we talk about certain things only when they are absent?\n\nHave you ever seen a horseful carriage or a strapful gown? Met a sung hero or experienced requited love? Have you ever run into someone who was combobulated, gruntled, ruly or peccable? And where are all those people who ARE spring chickens or who would ACTUALLY hurt a fly?\n\nYou have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling it out and in which an alarm clock goes off by going on.\n\nEnglish was invented by people, not computers, and it reflects the creativity of the human race (which, of course, isn't a race at all). That is why, when the stars are out, they are visible, but when the lights are out, they are invisible. And why, when I wind up my watch, I start it, but when I wind up this essay, I end it.\n\nsource: jokstop.com  :http://jokstop.com/1sY\nedit: \nwow 154 upvotes and 4th position,while with 2639 another is on 7th. go figure?",

During the interview the normal questions are asked like what qualifications he has, his flaws, etc... Then the CEO asks Dave, \"Give me one solid reason why I should hire you.\" to which Dave replies, \"I literally know everybody.\" The CEO looking confused says, \"What do you mean literally everybody?\" Dave explains to the CEO that he literally knows everybody and encourages the CEO to name any one person and he promises he knows them.\n\n\"I bet you dont know Tom Cruise\", says the CEO\n\n\"Tom!? Oh hell yeah! We took a few acting classes together back in college, great guy.\"\n\n\"Bullshit!\" the CEO replies, \"Im getting us flight right know and we are going to go visit him.\"\n\nSo Dave and the CEO get on a plane and head out west to find Tom Cruise's home. After some searching they find it and go to knock on the door. To the CEO's surprise Tom answers the door and the first thing out of his mouth is, \"DAVE! Oh man, I havent seen you in ages, come on in and share a drink with me!\" After a few hours of shooting the shit and pounding some brews the CEO and Dave decide its time to leave. On the way to the airport the CEO tells Dave, \"Ok, so im still not convinced, I mean, small world right? You couldnt possibly know Tom Cruise AND the president!\" Dave smirks and says, \"Would you like to go find out?\"\n\nThe CEO immediately buys plane tickets to go to D.C. to see if Dave is full of shit or not. The two manage to get on a tour of the White House when out of no where the CEO hears somebody yelling, \"Dave! Hey! Dave! So good to see you! Ive got a lot of meetings today but lets get a cup of coffee real quick!\" The CEO turns around to find that the president is the one yelling at Dave. Stunned and almost convinced that Dave literally knows everybody, the CEO says, \"Ok, mister, Tom Cruise and the president, thats impressive, but I highly doubt you know the Pope!\" Dave then recalls stories of his parents growing up in a small town with the Pope. The CEO ready to finally call Dave out fronts the bill for tickets to the Vatican to try and meet the Pope. As they stand in the crowd of thousands and thousands of people waiting to be blessed by the Pope, Dave tells the CEO, \"Im going to try to get us a better view.\" Dave makes his way past a few guards and up some stairs and the next thing you know he's walking out next to the Pope.\n\nDave returns to find the CEO is having a heart attack. Dave asks what happened and the CEO replies,\n\n\"I was blown away by the fact you knew the Pope but what really got me was the guy behind me who said, 'Hey! Who is that asshole with Dave?'\"",

A Chinese expedition had come in and claimed sovereignty of his little magic island on the pole, and he'd allowed it to keep them from blabbing where it was. So everything was good, except all the \"Made in China\" stickers the elves now had to put on all the toys. Just as he was leaving, the angel came back, yelling \"HEY SANTA!\", which caught the attention of the union rep, and he was in meetings for another hour.\n\nThe reindeer had dysentery, which meant feeding them medicine in stables filled with dung. He's somehow managed to get most of the way through this, when the angel popped up, yelling \"HEY SANTA!\". The reindeer panicked, pulled the sled around, knocking him over into the worst of it.\n\nAfter cleaning everything off, he had to shower and change again. This meant tiptoeing past the dreaded scale. Mrs. Claus was terribly concerned about his weight, and the quality of her cooking depended on what it said. He'd been avoiding this for weeks, because he was just over the edge, when the angel popped in. \"HEY SANTA!\" That caught her attention.\n\nHe was munching on a carrot by the time the sleigh was all hitched. At least in this, nothing could be ruin, as he hoisted himself up the icy step. \"HEY SANTA!\" yelled the angel though, surprising him, and letting slip his magic bag of toys. It would take at least an hour to clean up.\n\n\"WHAT?\" he yelled back at the angel.\n\n\"I just came from heaven. They're sending you a Christmas tree. It it eternal, and remain forever and ever wherever it's been placed. So where do you want me to stick it?\"\n\n...and that's how we got the tradition of an angel at the top of the Christmas tree.\n\n\n\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy Holidays!\n",

All the regulars take notice and fall silent.  \n \n\nWhen he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, \"I don't want to intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my condolences on your loss.\"  \n \n\nThe cowboy looks quite puzzled for a moment, then a light dawns in his eyes and he laughs.  \n \n\n\"Oh, no, everybody's just fine,\" he explains, \"It's just that my wife and I joined the Baptist Church and I had to quit drinking.\"  \n \n\n\"Hasn't affected my brothers though.\"  ",

        "body": "It had been a strange and rough winter at the North Pole.  There wasn\u2019t much snow but plenty of ice and rain.  During the month of December, Santa always begins to make sure his flying team is ready for the speedy night trip on the eve of Christmas.  Due to the weather, it was very rough going.  Now, you should know, it doesn\u2019t ever take all eight reindeer of them to pull the sleigh, but it helped share the load.  One could very well be enough, as they are magic.\n                \nSomething you may not know is that Santa wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of Rudolph.  After that initial saving of Christmas, Rudolph became a bit of a diva.  She got her very own song and Christmas special.  It\u2019s not that Santa didn\u2019t like Rudolph, he just didn\u2019t like sharing the spotlight, and besides that he had eight others who never got as famous as Rudolph.  Everyone knows Rudolph, and sure some people can name the other eight, but not everyone can.\n                \nWell, after all of this Christmas training, on the very Eve of Christmas, Santa came to check on his team.  Going to each individual stable one by one, as they all had their families or wanted privacy.  \n                \nDasher was the first he visited.  He spoke to Dasher and said, \u201cHo, ho, ho, are you ready to deliver Christmas joy to every girl and boy?\u201d \n                \nDasher shook her head.  Yes, I said her.  You might not know this, but the males actually shed their antlers in the winter.  This makes all the reindeer with antlers pulling Santa\u2019s sleigh female! \u201cSanta, I can\u2019t pull any sleighs, I have a terrible sprain in my leg after that last training session!  The one where you made me dash across the ice\u201d\n                \nSanta inspected her leg and nodded in agreement.  There was no way she could pull a sleigh without risking further injury.  Santa then came to Dancer\u2019s stable.  \u201cHo, ho, ho!  Dancer, it looks like you\u2019ll be taking the lead on your own, Dasher won\u2019t be able to come out on her leg.\u201d  \n                \nDancer shook her head, \u201cA dancer shouldn\u2019t go out without her partner, and I haven\u2019t practiced with any of the others.  I don\u2019t want to risk crashing the sleigh.\u201d\n                \nSanta pondered this for a moment and nodded in agreement.  It would be dangerous for Dancer to be alone at the front.  Santa with his belly like a bowl full of jelly, walked to Prancer\u2019s stable.  \u201cHo, ho, ho!  Prancer, you and Vixen will have to be at the front of the sleigh tonight, Dasher has sprained her leg, and Dancer can\u2019t be with a partner she hasn\u2019t been training with.\u201d\n                \nPrancer shook her head, \u201cI\u2019ve just not been in the mood for Christmas with all of this wet weather.  I\u2019ve nothing to preen or prance about lately.\u201d  She looked very depressed!\n                \nSanta sighed and nodded in agreement.  He understood the gray, wet, and damp weather had taken a toll on everyone.  Prancer was normally so full of joy, but this weather had drained her.  Santa moved on and with his beard of white he entered Vixen\u2019s stable.  \u201cHo, ho, ho!  Vixen you\u2019re going to be the lead on this year\u2019s Christmas of five pulling the slegh!  Dasher sprained her leg, Dancer needs a partner, and Prancer doesn\u2019t have the Christmas spirit to fly\u201d\n                \nVixen shook her head, \u201cSanta, I would love to be the lead, but if you remember I requested this year off so I can stay with some of the bucks this year.\u201d  \n                \nSanta pulled out his notebook from his coat, saw in his own handwriting that Vixen was on vacation, and nodded in agreement.  With a twinkle in his eye, he moved to Comet\u2019s stable.  \u201cHo, ho, ho!  Comet, my girl, are you ready to fall on the rooftops this Christmas?  I\u2019m half-staffed now: Dasher sprained her leg, Dancer needs a partner, Prancer is feeling down, and Vixen has the day off.\u201d\n                \nComet shook her head.  \u201cSanta, you know I need the stars in the sky if I\u2019m going to be in the front!  I wouldn\u2019t know the North Pole from the South Pole without them!\u201d\n                \nSanta stepped outside, looked up and saw the clouds blanketing the sky above, and nodded in agreement.  With his rosy cheeks he came to Cupid\u2019s stable only to find it empty.  He moved onto Donner\u2019s stable, and said, \u201cHo, ho, ho!\u201d  Cupid and Donner were nuzzling against each other.  \u201cWell you two, are you ready to go \u2018Click, click, click!\u2019?  Dasher sprained her leg, Dancer needs a partner, Prancer is feeling down, Vixen has the day off, and Comet needs the stars to be in front!\u201d\n                \nCupid and Donner shook their heads, \u201cSanta, we told you we would only do it if both of us can be side by side in the front.\u201d  Santa told them sadly he couldn\u2019t make that happen this year.  They said they would take legal action if they couldn\u2019t.  \n                \nSanta thought about the Christmas lawsuit, and nodded in agreement.  He moved on to his last hope before having to ask Rudolph.  Blitzen!  Opening the stable door he said, \u201cHo, ho, ho!  Blitzen looks like it\u2019ll just be me and you!  Dasher sprained her leg, Dancer needs a partner, Prancer is feeling down, Vixen has the day off, Comet needs the stars, and Cupid and Donner threatened to sue me.\u201d\n                \nBlitzen spoke up, \u201cThat\u2019s a bingo!  Ve could first go to Poland, and then, very quickly, move into France.  They von\u2019t know vhat them Santa Claus!\u201d  Hearing this Santa\u2019s eyes went wide.\n                \n\u201cI think I remember why you don\u2019t lead the sleigh!  We will start in the United States as always!\u201d\n               \nBlitzen shook her head, \u201cNein!  Unless ve use my plan I von\u2019t fly!\u201d\n                \nSanta nodded in agreement that she wouldn\u2019t fly.  He sighed and went to Rudolph\u2019s stable that was so much fancier than the others.  Adorned with lights and decorations, it was heated and carpeted.  A security guard stood at the front.  \u201cName?\u201d\n                \n\u201cHo, ho, ho! It\u2019s me Santa Clause\u201d Santa sighed.  \n                \n\u201cWhat do you want with Miss Rudolph?\u201d  The guard asked\n                \n\u201cI would like to ask her to guide my sleigh tonight.\u201d\n                \nRudolph came out hearing the familiar voice and said, \u201cOh Mr. Clause, you really are something.  You come to me after all this time, and only when you need me.  Well, I don\u2019t need you anymore!  But\u2026for old time\u2019s sake, I\u2019ll help you out.  Who knows?  Maybe I\u2019ll get a new song.\u201d\n                \nAround the world they went in a flash.  The presents were delivered, Rudolph\u2019s nose, as usual, being the gaudy signal which Santa hated.  After he came back home, he sat and his chair and spoke to Mrs. Clause.  Tired and beat he said, \u201cHo, ho, ho!  It was an awful trip this year.  Rudolph was insufferable.  I wish at least some of the others were there.\u201d\n                \nMrs. Clause looked at him and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t expect them all to fly in the rain, dear!\u201d",

There, in the corner, there\u2019s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.\n\nSo the guy asks the bartender, \u201cWhere\u2019d he come from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThere\u2019s a genie in the men\u2019s room who grants wishes.\u201d\n\nSo the guy runs into the men\u2019s room and, sure enough, there\u2019s this genie. And the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d So the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cO.K., I wish for world peace.\u201d And there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and then the room fills up with geese.\n\nSo the guy walks out of the men\u2019s room and he\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nSo the guy processes this. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cDoes that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cYeah. Why, what did you wish for?\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWorld peace.\u201d\n\nSo the bartender is understandably ashamed.\n\nAnd the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it\u2019s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI feel like I should explain myself further.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nBut the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d\n\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.\n\nSo the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nAnd then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s just grab a beer.

The first thing the General spots \u2013 and smells \u2013 is this beat up, dirty, flea bitten camel lying in squalor near the entrance to the place.\n\n\u201cGood God man!!\u201d he yells at the captain.  \u201cGet that god-forsaken animal the hell out of here!  NOW!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cSir! Begging the General's pardon but the Camel has a purpose.  You see, this place is dead in the middle of nowhere.  And when the troops get lonely.   Well Sir.   They use the camel.\u201d\n\nThe General waves a hand at the captain as if to say he doesn't want to hear another word, and they move on.   The captain escorts the General to his quarters and nothing more is said of the reeking, filthy Camel.\n\nAfter a few months however, the general finds himself feeling his normal manly urges arise.   But no matter how bad or how heavy they get, the General holds firm and just keeps pressing on with the duties of his command.   A couple of months more however, and the poor General is beside himself.   \n\nHe summons the Captain.   \u201cCaptain\u201d, the General starts. \u201cQuestion about the Camel.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes Sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the men need to 'use' the Camel, I'm assuming that you bathe, delouse, and clean her up yes?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Yes sir of course!!\u201d exclaims the Captain.  You wouldn't even recognize her!\n\n\u201cProceed with the necessary preparations Captain\u201d barks the General. \u201cI need her ready this evening\u201d\n\nSo the General enters the Camel's stall that night.  And true to the Captain's word, the Camel standing before him is a completely different animal than the one the General first encountered all those months ago:  bathed, scented, and brushed - and adorned with beautiful reigns, and a decked in a colorful locally woven blanket.  \n\nThe General climbs up on a nearby ladder, positions himself his needed relief, and starts going at it with the Camel like a demon.\n\nA couple of minutes into it, the Captain comes running into the Camel's stall to investigate all the ruckus.   \n\n\u201cSir!! Sir!!\u201d he cries out to the General. \n\n\u201cGod Damnit Captain can't you let a man have some privacy!!??\u201d shouts the General in mid drill.\n\n\u201cYes Sir\u201d snaps the Captain.  \u201cIt's just that most men ride the camel to the local brothel to find a woman.\u201d\n",

        "body": "It had been a strange and rough winter at the North Pole.  There wasn\u2019t much snow but plenty of ice and rain.  During the month of December, Santa always begins to make sure his flying team is ready for the speedy night trip on the eve of Christmas.  Due to the weather, it had been very rough going.  It didn\u2019t ever take all eight of them to pull the sleigh, but it helped share the load.  One could very well be enough, as they are magic.\n                Now, something you may not know is that Santa wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of Rudolph after that initial saving of Christmas.  I think it has something to do with Rudolph getting his own song and Christmas special.  It\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t like Rudolph, he just didn\u2019t like sharing the spotlight, and besides that he had eight others who never got as famous as Rudolph.  Everyone knows Rudolph, and sure some people can name the other eight, but not everyone can.\n                \nWell after all of this Christmas training on the very Eve of Christmas, Santa came to check on his team.  Going individually built Stables for each one as they all had their families.  \n                Dasher was the first he visited.  He spoke to Dasher and said, \u201cHo, ho, ho, are you ready to deliver Christmas joy to every girl and boy?\u201d \n                Dasher shook her head.  Yes, I said her.  You might not know this, but the males actually shed their antlers in the winter.  This makes all the reindeer with antlers pulling Santa\u2019s sleigh female! \u201cSanta, I can\u2019t pull any sleighs, I have a terrible sprain in my leg after that last training session!  The one where you made me sprint across the ice\u201d\n                Santa inspected her leg and nodded in agreement.  There was no way she could pull a sleigh without risking further injury.  Santa then came to Dancer\u2019s stable.  \u201cHo, ho, ho!  Dancer, it looks like you\u2019ll be taking the lead on your own, Dasher won\u2019t be able to come out on her leg.\u201d  \n                Dancer shook her head, \u201cA dancer shouldn\u2019t go out without her partner, and I haven\u2019t practiced with any of the others.  I don\u2019t want to risk crashing the sleigh.\u201d\n                Santa pondered this for a moment and nodded in agreement.  It would be dangerous for Dancer to be alone at the front.  Santa with his belly like a bowl full of jelly, walked to Prancer\u2019s stable.  \u201cHo, ho, ho!  Prancer, you and Vixen will have to be at the front of the sleigh tonight, Dasher has sprained her leg, and Dancer can\u2019t be with a partner she hasn\u2019t been training with.\u201d\n                Prancer shook her head, \u201cI\u2019ve just not been in the mood for Christmas with all of this wet weather.  I\u2019ve nothing to preen or prance about lately.\u201d  She looked very depressed!\n                Santa sighed and nodded in agreement.  He understood the gray, wet, and damp weather had taken a toll on everyone.  Prancer was normally so full of joy, but this weather had drained her.  Santa moved on and with his beard of white he entered Vixen\u2019s stable.  \u201cHo, ho, ho!  Vixen you\u2019re going to be the lead on this year\u2019s Christmas of five pulling the slegh!  Dasher sprained her leg, Dancer needs a partner, and Prancer is feeling blue\u201d\n                Vixen shook her head, \u201cSanta, I would love to be the lead, but if you remember I requested this year off so I can stay with some of the bucks this year.\u201d  \n                Santa pulled out his notebook from his coat, saw in his own handwriting that Vixen was on vacation, and nodded in agreement.  With a twinkle in his eye, he moved to Comet\u2019s stable.  \u201cHo, ho, ho!  Comet, my girl, are you ready to fall on the rooftops this Christmas?  I\u2019m half-staffed now: Dasher sprained her leg, Dancer needs a partner, Prancer is feeling down, and Vixen has the day off.\u201d\n                Comet shook her head.  \u201cSanta, you know I need the stars in the sky if I\u2019m going to be in the front!  I wouldn\u2019t know the North Pole from the South Pole!\u201d\n                Santa stepped outside, looked up and saw the clouds blanketing the sky above, and nodded in agreement.  With his rosy cheeks he came to Cupid\u2019s stable only to find it empty.  He moved onto Donner\u2019s stable, and said, \u201cHo, ho, ho!\u201d  Cupid and Donner were nuzzling against each other.  \u201cWell you two, are you ready to go \u2018Click, click, click!\u2019?  Dasher sprained her leg, dancer needs a partner, Prancer is feeling down, Vixen has the day off, and Comet needs the stars to be in front!\u201d\n                Cupid and Donner shook their heads, \u201cSanta, we told you we would only do it if both of us can be side by side in the front.\u201d  Santa told them sadly he couldn\u2019t make that happen this year.  They said they would take legal action if they couldn\u2019t.  \n                Santa thought about the Christmas lawsuit, and nodded in agreement.  He moved on to his last hope before having to ask Rudolph.  Blitzen!  Opening the stable door he said, \u201cHo, ho, ho!  Blitzen looks like it\u2019ll just be me and you!  Dasher sprained her leg, Dancer needs a partner, Prancer is feeling down, Vixen has the day off, Comet needs the stars, and Cupid and Donner threatened to sue me.\u201d\n                Blitzen spoke up, \u201cThat\u2019s a bingo!  Ve could first go to Poland, and then, very quickly, move into France.  They von\u2019t know vhat them Santa Claus!\u201d  Hearing this Santa\u2019s eyes went wide.\n                \u201cI think I remember why you don\u2019t lead the sleigh!  We will start in the United States as always!\u201d\n                Blitzen shook her head, \u201cNein!  Unless ve use my plan I von\u2019t fly!\u201d\n                Santa nodded in agreement.  He sighed and went to Rudolph\u2019s stable that was so much more fancy than the others.  Adorned with lights and decorations, it was heated and carpeted.  A security guard stood at the front.  \u201cName?\u201d\n                \u201cHo, ho, ho! It\u2019s me Santa Clause\u201d Santa sighed.  \n                \u201cWhat do you want with Miss Rudolph?\u201d  The guard asked\n                \u201cI would like to ask her to guide my sleigh tonight.\u201d\n                Rudolph came out hearing the familiar voice and said, \u201cOh Mr. Clause, you really are something.  You come to me after all this time, and only using me when you need me.  Well, I don\u2019t need you anymore!  But for old time\u2019s sake I\u2019ll help you out.  Who knows?  Maybe I\u2019ll get a new song.\u201d\n                Around the world they went in a flash the presents were delivered, Rudolph\u2019s nose being the gaudy signal Santa hated.  After he came back he came to Mrs. Clause.  Tired and beat he said, \u201cHo, ho, ho!  It was an awful trip this year.  Rudolph was insufferable.  I wish at least some of the others were there.\u201d\n                Mrs. Clause looked at him and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t expect them all to fly in the rain, dear!\u201d\n\n\n ",

There was something odd about the man, but from a distance, Quasimodo couldn't distinguish what it was.  The man climbed the ladder, and it was evident - he had no arms.  He saw Quasimodo and said, \"It has been my lifelong dream to ring the bells of Notre Dame!  Please allow me this great favor!\"\n\nQuasimodo said, \"No!  I ring the bells!  Besides, you have no arms!\"\n\nThe man replied, \"I know, but it is my dream!\"\n\nQuasimodo again refused, but the man was persistent, and finally Quasimodo relented, not sure how the man would accomplish ringing  the bells.  The armless man lay down beside the bell, put his feet on the bell and shoved the bell with his feet as hard as he could.  Then he stood up, and as the bell swung back toward him, he stuck his head forward.  The bell struck him in the face with a resounding \"GONG!\"  Again, he lay down and shoved the bell with his feet, stood, and let the bell hit him.  \"GONG!\"  After the third time, the armless man was knocked so woozy that he stumbled and fell off the steeple.  In horror, Quasimodo scurried down the ladder to the man.  By the time he reached him, a priest was there, administering last rites.  The priest turned to Quasimodo and asked, \"Do you know this man?\"  \n\nQuasimodo answered, \"No, but his face rings a bell.\"\n\n\nSome months later, Quasimodo was in the steeple and saw a man climbing the ladder.  He thought he had seen the man before - it was the identical twin of the man with no arms!  The twin had no arms, too.  He said to Quasimodo, \"A few months ago my brother came here to ring the bells, and he fell to his death.  I want to honor my brother by completing his wishes.  Please let me ring the bells!\"  \n\nQuasimodo refused.  \"No!  Your brother died!  Go away!\"  \n\nStill, the brother persisted, and finally Quasimodo said, \"Ok.  Go ahead!\"  \n\nThe brother lay down and used the same technique - shoving the bell with his feet and letting the bell swing back and strike him in the head.  And again, after a few strikes, the twin was so woozy he fell to his death.  \n\nWhen Quasimodo climbed down the ladder, the priest was again administering last rites, and asked, \"Who is this man?\"  \n\nQuasimodo answered, \"I don't know, but he's a dead ringer for his brother.\"",

I spent a couple years living in China (I have no Chinese heritage whatsoever), where I met my wife, who speaks Mandarin & some English as a 2nd language.  Her English is good, but she struggles with some words.  The first time she saw my penis she said \"Wow, it's very wai-de, it's maybe the most wai-de penis in the world!\".  I of course was thinking \"Aww, hell yeah, I got a wide penis!\", which is a stark contrast to every other woman who's ever seen it and been like \"Oh, that's it?\".  I had heard in stand up comedy and other various reputable news sources that Chinese guys were not as well endowed as us Westerners, typically, so I figured it was a racial difference.  The first time we had sex, she was yelling \"Oh my god it's so wai-de, it hurts me it's so wai-de!\" and I was so proud of myself.  A year after we were married, we were walking outside & she picked up a stick & held it up and said with a naughty grin \"Look, honey, it's wai-de, like your penis\".  I looked at the stick, and noticed it was quite narrow, considerably thinner than my penis, which I pointed out.  She said \"No, I mean... it goes straight, then suddenly goes left... Wai-De\".  We got out a dictionary.  \"Wai-de\" is Chinese for \"Crooked\".  She's like \"OH!  Yes...  It's very crooked like your penis\".  I was like \"Oh, I thought you meant my penis was big\".  She said \"Ohhhh, no no, very small.\"",

        "body": "There was this tramp. One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.\n\nCoincidentally the father drives up. \"How can I ever thank you sir?\" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. \"Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.\"\n\n\"Ah, well...\" stammers the tramp, \"... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.\"\n\n\"Oh dear,\" says the father, \"I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.\"\n\n\"No! No!\" says the tramp, \"Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.\"\n\n\"Ten pounds,\" thinks the tramp, \"I'm rich! I'm rich!\" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.\n\nHe finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. \"I'll have one holiday please!\"\n\n\"Ahem, which holiday would sir like?\" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.\n\n\"Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,\" replies the tramp.\n\n\"TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,\" says the girl incredulously.\n\nShe goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.\n\n\"Well you'll never believe it,\" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. \"I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.\"\n\n\"Yippee!\" exclaims the tramp, \"I'll take it!\"\n\nA few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.\n\n\"Get off my ship ye dirty bum!\" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.\n\n\"But I've got my ticket!\", responds the tramp, \"super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!\"\n\n\"Well okay,\" says the captain, \"but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.\"\n\nSo the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.\n\n\"Psst,\" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.\n\n\"Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.\"\n\nThe tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!\n\nFirst they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6\" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.\n\nThen the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3\" deep, and so on...\n\n3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.\n\n\"Sheer luxury!\" exclaimed the tramp, \"A room of my very own.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you like it,\" replies the captain, \"but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.\"\n\nWell the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...\n\nThen one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.\n\nHe climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...\n\n... and what a dive...!\n\nPerfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.\n\nNow unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.\n\n\"That was amazing!\" exclaimed the captain, \"Where did you learn to dive like that?\"\n\n\"Um, well I've never actually dived before,\" replied the tramp.\n\n\"Well that's incredible!\" says the captain, \"I've never seen...\" He broke off. \"Hey, I've got an idea\", he started again. \"How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!\"\n\n\"It's a deal!\" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.\n\nThen one morning the captain comes to talk. \"Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" agreed the tramp.\n\nTwo days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.\n\n\"Well, tramp,\" said the captain, shaking his hand, \"Let's see what you can do.\" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...\n\nup and up...\n\nbelow him the ship grew smaller...\n\non and on...\n\npast a solitary albatross...\n\nand still higher...\n\ntill the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...\n\nand on still further...\n\ntill the ocean grew dim...\n\nand the earth itself...\n\nbegan to shrink...\n\npast our moon...\n\nand on...\n\nand Mars...\n\nand on...\n\nhigher, and higher...\n\nthrough the asteroid belt...\n\nand on and on towards the diving board...\n\npast the outer planets, until...\n\non the outermost reaches of the Solar System...\n\nhe reached the board.\n\nHe climbed on top and radioed the captain...\n\nand then...\nhe jumped.\nSlowly at first, but speeding up, faster, and faster, speeding past Pluto, and the other outer planets, through the asteroid belt, past Mars, and the moon, faster, and faster, faster - ever faster, and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear, faster, and faster, past the albatross, double-back somersault, and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance. hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet. Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,\n\n\"I CAN SEE HIM!\" yelled a passenger, \"LOOK!!!\"\n\nThe tramp streaked down towards the pool on the deck, did a last triple flip, and landed...\n\nNOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!\n\nDOWN THROUGH THE WATER!\n\nSMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!\n\nDOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!\n\nSMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!\n\nDOWN!\n\nDOWN!\n\nTHROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!\n\nTHROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!\n\nSMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!\n\nAND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!\n\nSTILL DOWN...!\n\nDEEPER,\n\nDEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,\n\nTILL.........\n\nSMASH!\n\nInto the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.\n\nDesperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.\n\nUp and up, desperate, gasping...\n\nOut of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.\n\n\"HERO!\" \"WONDERFUL!\" \"AMAZING!\" \"GOOD SHOW THAT!\"\n\nAnd handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.\n\n\"Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.\"\n\nThe tramp blushed.\n\nThe captain went on, \"but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it?\"\n\nAnd the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: \"Well you see, I'm a just poor tramp so you must understand... I've been through many a hard ship in my life.\"",

A distant relative had recently passed away, and the couple suddenly found themselves with a slew of antiques.  Amongst these was an enormous grandfather clock.\n\n\n  The clock was gorgeous -- hand-crafted from the finest hickory money could buy.  They placed it on a carpet in view of the front door, so it could be shown off when guests were over.\n\n\n  Whenever nobody was home, a mouse could be seen scurrying about; it would flitz to and fro without a care.  The family's pet cat soon caught wind of this, however, and made it a daily ritual to chase the poor mouse everywhere it went.  The days went by, and the races continued.\n\n\n  One day, a slew of new objects was introduced to their battlefield; the mouse made full use of these, and immediately hopped up onto a new-found table as he approached it.  He thought he was safe, but found the cat in close pursuit.  As a last resort, the mouse lept onto the next object he saw -- the family's prized clock.  As he raced up its side, the cat came whizzing over, and the whole lot toppled to the ground, destroying the beloved antique.\n\n\n  When the couple came home to this sight, they were dismayed. \"How could such a thing have happened?\"  In time, though, sadness was forgotten, and the fisherman decided to put the wood to good use; he had been meaning to build a new dock for some time, and the pieces from the clock would make the perfect size planks for what he had in mind.  \n\n\n  In a couple days, the project was complete and ready to be put to use.  He pulled his boat alongside it, tied it up, and stepped off.  Upon making contact with the poloshed wood, his foot slipped out from underneath him.  He hit his head and died.\n\n\n*The moral?*\n\n\nDon't let a mouse run up the clock, or you'll have a slippery hickory dock.",

The bartender slides one over and he chugs it, relishing the cold liquid.\n\nAt the end of a few hours, the man has racked up quite a large bill. He yawns and gets up to stretch and leave, but is stopped by a hand on his shoulder. \"How're you gonna pay for that?\" growls the now-hostile bartender.    \n\"Oh!\" laughs the man in surprise. \"Sorry, I completely forgot! Let me just...\" He trails off, realizing with a feeling of dread that his pouch is empty.    \n\"You have to pay,\" the bartender tells him angrily.   \n\"I know, I know, I just, give me a second,\" stalls the man in desperation. Suddenly, an idea pops into his head that just might work...    \n\n\"I'll tell a story!\" he declares. \"Trust me! It'll be a great story.\"   \nThis piques the bartender's interest, as he hasn't heard a new story in years of being in the town. \"Alright. And I'll toss in a free room for the night,\" he grunts. \"Well, sit down and get started.\"\n\nSo the man sits on a barstool and begins to weave a wonderful story with magic and dragons and fantasy, and near the end, every patron in the small inn is listening. However, the story ends with a huge anticlimax, and everyone groans to themselves as the group disperses.    \n\"What was that?\" roars the bartender, but the man has already gone up to his room.\n\nThe next morning, when the man emerges from the stairwell, the bartender is there, cleaning mugs. \"That story was so disappointing last night, son,\" he grumbles.    \n\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\" says the man. \"I'll make up for it tonight if you give me another night here.\" The bartender agrees, and they part on good terms.\n\nThat evening, everyone gathers around to hear another story. The man begins to speak, talking of steel and guns and war, but alas! this story, too, ends in a terribly disappointing anticlimax. \n\n\"Look, buddy,\" snarls the bartender, pulling the man aside. \"If you tell one more damn story like that, I'm gonna take you out into the desert-\" He makes a gun with his fingers. \"And shoot ya.\"    \nThe man nods, terrified for his life.    \n\"But if you tell a good story, then I'll give you three nights and as many free drinks as you want.\"    \nThe man nods again and scampers away, only returning much later.   \n\nThat night, everyone crowds around again, looking interested and impatient. The man takes a deep breath and starts to speak of a forest and animals and elves. Halfway through, he falters, glancing at the bartender, who slides his finger across his throat threateningly. Shaken, he continues, sparing the occasional glance at the bartender, who glares at him each time. Predictably, this one ends with the worst anticlimax of all.\n\nSo the bartender takes the man out into the desert and shoots him.",

He lived in a small country in South America. Juan lived a simple life, and was simply happy.\n\nOne day, he was sitting in a coffeeshop with a few friends, when the topic of the election for mayor came up. One of his friends said 'Hey Juan, why don't you run? You're a really great guy!' Juan smiled and thanked his friends for their kindness, but they were persistant, as they should be...he was a great candidate and a great guy; he didn't beat his wife, or his kids, or the aardvark in the backyard. Juan reluctantly agreed, and posted a few signs out to announce his candidacy; he thought of it as kinda a joke Well, as it turned out, when word got around that Juan was running, his popularity grew fast. 'Wow, Juan is running?' 'What a great guy!' 'I heard he doesn't beat his wife, or his kids!' 'Yeah, nor the aarvark in the backyard!' Well, to nobodies surprise (except Juan), he won by a landslide (the other candidate was Oliver North), and was sworn into office with a very surprised look on his face. Well, he saw that there was do getting out of it, so he decided to do his best.\n\nAnd his best was quite good. The town prospered like it never had before. The crime for the year consisted of someone dropping a lollipop stick on the sidewalk. He spent 6% of the budget, and donated the rest to the Dum Fiters Relief Fund. The townspeople were ecstatic, and his performance turned a lot of heads. Everyone in the town was thrilled with Juan as mayor; he didn't beat his wife, or his kids, or the aardvark in the backyard. Well, at the end of the year, with his term almost up, Juan was pretty pooped. As he sat in the coffeeshop with his friends, reflecting on the year, one suggested that, despite the town's success, the province was in some financial trouble. 'Heck, with Juan's record, he should be governor!' another smiled. Juan wondered why everyone's eyes lit up suddenly. Within hours the campaign was on. All the ads and posters had the same theme: 'Vote for Juan! He doesn't beat his wife, or his kids, or the aardvark in the backyard!' When election day came, there was no doubt about the winner; Juan had been in the lead since the week he had entered. Governer Juan sat back in his padded chair and went to work once again.\n\nHis record was brilliant for the two years he spent as governor. The crime rate fell by 2/3, the budget was balanced, education rose sharply, and the province's Soccer Team sold out every game that Juan attended (he was a big Soccer Buff). The whole country was now buzzing with Juan;s work. Everyone commented how he was such a great guy, how he didn't beat his wife, how he didn't beat his kids, and how he didn't beat the aardvark in the backyard. Then the President was shot. This meant that they needed a new president. Normally, they would turn to the vice-president, except for the fact in this case was that the vice-president was the murderer. Hmm. The Governors got together to decide on a new President for the remaining three years of the term. Each one walked into the room with a mailsack full of letters, all of which has similar messages: 'Juan for President!' 'Let Juan preside as President!' 'How can you not select Juan? He doesn't beat his wife, doesn't beat his kids, and doesn't beat the aardavrk in the backyard? What else do you want?' To make a very long story not quite as long, Juan was quickly named president, and the country was glad he did. The country prospered; new trade agreements were made, old disputes were settled, and there was peace throughout the country. Juan was a national hero. One day Juan came home from work exhausted. He put his briefcase down and plopped down in his easy chair. His mind was racing, but he was exhausted. He couldn't concentrate...pressure from everyone...lobbiests want this...governors want that....everyone wants this and that and acccccckkkkk!!!!!! Juan looked out the window into the backyard. As usual, the aardvark was out there slurping up ants. Wander....wander....sluuuurp! Wander.....wander....sluuuurp! The monotonous repetition snapped something in Juan's mind. A sudden rage built up inside of him, something evil and uncontrollable. He stood Unfortunatelty for Juan, his neighbour heard the CRACKs and quickly moved the telescope from Juan's upstairs window, where his daughter was undressing, down to the yard, and witnessed the brutal attack. He immediately phoned the police, and within hours, Juan was behind bars, the aardvark rushed to the hospital, and the telescope back up to the upstairs window. The country was horrified, and the citizens called for nothing less than the usual penalty given out for this type of crime....death by firing squad. It was granted, and the punishment was to be carried out swiftly. Juan stood there, broken and insane.\n\nThe firing squad levied their guns at him. 'Ready.......' 'Aim.........' Suddenly, and without warning, the aardvark leapt from the shadows, aimed at Juan and fired a golf gun. The shot boomed throughout the town, and the shot itself went clear through Juan's heart and out his back.\n\nYou may be asking yourself in between sobs what a golf gun is?\n\nThe answer...well, I don't know. But it sure made a hole-in-Juan!\n\nObligatory POPPED MY GOLD CHERRY!",

While he is working he notices 4 wolves on the opposite bank starting towards him. Becoming concerned, he tries to work faster, but his canoe will not budge. The wolves are closer still, and the hunter decides to run into the woods. He finds the largest tree he can and pulls himself into the branches just as the 4 wolves are at his heels, but he makes it safe and sound. Clinging to the tree he looks down to the wolves and says, \"Brothers, I do not taste good. You do not want to eat me. Go find yourselves a tasty otter or beaver, you will enjoy eating that much more than I.\" Two of the wolves start away after his words, and the hunter says to the two remaining, \"Be smart like your brothers and leave, if you wait for me you will simply starve, as I am not leaving this tree.\" The two wolves have no reaction to his words and lay down to snooze at the base of the tree. Feeling tired from the ordeal himself, the hunter still clinging to the tree has a snooze of his own. He awakes later in the afternoon to the sound of the first two wolves returning to the others at the base of the tree each with a beaver in its mouth. \"Ah, you were not smart like your brothers who have food of their own, you will go hungry due to your foolishness.\" The first two wolves drop the beavers, who in turn start gnawing at the base of the tree.\n",

He finds the Ringmaster, tells him about his horrible home-life and then begs to join up.\n\n\"well I sympathise with your situation little man\" - The ringmaster says - \"but you've got to have a TALENT to be in the circus you see. Our trapeze artists perform wonderful acts of aerial agility, our bearded lady draws gasps of wonder, Coco the clown can juggle and tell jokes\"\n\n\"Just let me perform\" - Wee Jimmy says - \"I promise I wont disappoint you.\"\n\nThe Ringmaster reluctantly agrees, feeling sorry for poor Wee Jimmy. After all, he does have such an awful time at home.\n\nOver the next week. Jimmy hangs around with the other performers. Helps the trapeze artists with their ropes and pulleys. He combs the bearded lady's beard. Gives Coco a few new jokes for his repertoire. They all grow very fond of the little fella. However, the Ringmaster is a little concerned that Wee Jimmy does not seem to be practising any kind of act. \n\nThe following Saturday. The Circus has its opening night. The trapeze artists amaze, the bearded lady confounds and Coco has them laughing uncontrollably with his oversized feet and hilarious jokes. Finally its time for Wee Jimmy's act. The Big Top goes silent. \n\nA spotlight appears in the centre of the ring. The audience look down to see a very large anvil. A few confused mutterings are heard amongst the audience. Then, after a moment, Jimmy walks in pulling a very large sledge-hammer. It takes him a while to drag the thing across to the anvil, and the whole time the audience stare at each other wondering what is going to happen. Jimmy puts down the handle and stands up on the Anvil. \n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen, I will require a volunteer from the Audience.\"\n\nThere is mostly silence, a little more chattering but nobody sticks up their hand.\n\n\"Anybody. Ladies and Gentlemen. I can't do the trick by myself\"\n\nThe audience are still staring at each other, eventually a bloke at the back stands up, a big body-builder bloke.\n  \n\"I'll volunteer\" - he says.\n\nThe man walks down into the ring, his arms and legs are like like tree-trunks, his whole body is very hairy and he is sporting a thick bushy beard.\n\n\"Now I am going to place my head on the Anvil, and what I want you to do is hit me as hard as you can with this sledge-hammer.\"\n\nThe body-builder bloke is a little confused but Wee Jimmy reassures him and so he agrees. Next there is a drum-roll and the sledge-hammer is lifted high above Jimmy's head. \n\n\"BANG!!!!!!\"\n\nThere is blood and brains and pieces of skull everywhere. The audience is in chaos, women are screaming, children are crying. Its bedlam. Eventually somebody calls the ambulance-men and they arrive - sirens blaring and take Jimmy to the hospital.\n  \nA month goes by. Wee Jimmy is in a terrible state, a deep coma and attached to a ventilator.\n\nThe Ringmaster feels terrible, he rarely leaves Jimmy's bedside. All the other performers visit every day.\nThe trapeze artists read him stories. The bearded lady sings songs. Coco tries to tell Wee Jimmy about new material he has been working on.\n\nIt's no good. Wee Jimmy remains in a critical condition. \n\n6 Months later. \n\nAfter all this time, The trapeze artist have run out of stories, the bearded lady's voice is hoarse and Coco has lost the will to live. The Ringmaster holds Jimmy's hand and cries.\n\n\"Oh Wee Jimmy, you have had such a hard time in your few short years. You deserve some happy years. Please come round Wee Jimmy.\"\n\nSuddenly there is a flinch. The Ringmaster is shocked to see Jimmy's eyelids flickering. He jumps up he shouts out to the hall and calls in the other circus folk, still pacing in the hallway - the trapeze artists and the bearded lady and Coco. - \"He is waking up, he is waking up!\"\n\nThey all gather round Jimmy's bedside. Elated. Jimmy begins to move his mouth. He starts to open his eyes a little. \n\n\"He is going to say something\" - whispers one of the trapeze artists.\n\n\"This is wonderful\" - says the Bearded Lady.\n\n\"A miracle\" - says Coco.\n\nFinally Wee Jimmy, lifts his head stares directly at the Ringmaster and shouts,\n\n -\n\nTA DA !!\n\n\n\n\n",

After being given the key to his cabin he asks that he be given a 6 am wakeup call because he wanted to get started as early as possible.\n\nThe next morning after a quick breakfast he strides out of his cabin and past the office with rod and tackle bag in hand. Just after dark he walks into the manager's office with 8 very fine Scottish, stream bred, trout in his fishing basket and an enormous smile on his face.\n\n'What a brilliant session' he exclaimed, \u201cI've never experienced any thing like it, could you please wake me up 5:30 tomorrow\u201d. \n\nThe next night he was back at the door, absolutely festooned with a dozen prized trout and a very tired but ecstatic look on his face.\n\n\u201cPlease make it 5 am tomorrow morning, fishing is my passion, my reason for living and this place is my heaven, I can't waste a moment.\u201d\n\nWhen the manager saw him the next evening it was a sight to behold. Not only fish hanging from every conceivable part of his fishing jacket but he had a wheelbarrow filled to the brim. There were bags under his eyes, his hands were trembling and his voice was very raspy but the look of contentment on his face spoke volumes.\n\n\u201cBetter make it 4 am tomorrow please\u201d was the request, \u201cThis is my last night then my honeymoon is over.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoneymoon?\u201d came the query, \u201cI hadn't realised sir, I must say I haven't seen your wife, is she okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, just not comfortable around strangers. Actually just between you and me she isn't the most attractive person and doesn't like being gawked at.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I am sorry to hear that sir but be that as it may, shouldn't you spend your last night here with her?\u201d asked the manager.\n\n'Well did I mention she was not all that attractive? I'm afraid this wasn't quite true, she is actually hideous, I'm not sure I could even do the deed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell sir, perhaps with the lights off and a paper bag for good measure might suffice? It is also her honeymoon as well you know.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes but you see\u201d replied the fisherman, \u201cmy bride has a terrible prolapse along with two venereal diseases, I just couldn't\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy goodness\u201d was the response.\n\n\u201cAnd before you say I should turn her around her persistent and sizable hemorrhoids make that an impossibility\u201d.\n\n\u201cWell sir I am indeed struggling, perhaps allowing her to perform fellatio might be an option?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat with all those rotten and chipped teeth, it would be like having oral sex from a shark. Not a chance!\u201d protested the fisherman.\n\n\u201cOuch\u201d came the reply form the manager, \u201cI will admit to being at a loss, is her at least giving you a hand-job out of the question?\u201d\n\n\u201cTotally, the warts and ulcers and chipped nails would see to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm sorry sir but I simply must know, why on earth did you marry her?\u201d asked the manager resignedly.\n\n\u201cWhy for the worms son, for the worms.\u201d",

Saint Peter looked at the Nuns and said.\n\n\"I will call each of you to the gates and ask you the question, which you must answer truthfully. On giving a satifactory answer you will be admitted to the Kingdom of Heaven. If you lie ... then it is the fires of Eternal Damnation for you\" Being God fearing people the Nuns all agreed to the conditions and the first Nun went up to the Gate.\n\n\"Sister\" said Saint Peter \"Have you ever touched a Mans penis\"\n\nAt this the first Nun nearly fainted. She went deeply red and looked like she wanted the ground to swallow her. Looking at the Nun Saint Peter said ... \"You must confess all before admittance to Heaven\". Looking most dejected ... the Nun said \"I have to be honest. I did once touch a mans penis with the very tip of this finger. I was curious and it looked so funny.\" she said holding out her right index finger.\n\nSaint Peter smiled at the Nun and said \"Sister, you will be admitted to the Kingdom of Heaven once you have dipped the tip of your right index finger into the Holy Water held in the font to your left\"\n\nPractically skipping over to the font the Nun dipped her finger into the Holy water and was promptly admitted into the Kingdom of Heaven. The second Nun has been watching this and approached Saint Peter. The same question was asked of the second Nun, \"Sister\" said Saint Peter \"Have you ever touched a mans penis\"\n\nAgain, the second Nun looked horrified at being asked such a question, but offered her answer forward a little easier than the first Nun. \"Saint Peter\" she said \"I have to admit that I once let a mans penis enter my vagina. It was before I entered the Convent and I didn't much enjoy it. In fact it was a bit of a let down.\"\n\nSaint Peter smiled at the Nun and said \"Sister, you will be admitted to the Kingdom of Heaven once you have dipped your vagina into the Holy Water held in the font to your left\" Willingly she did this and was entered (practically running) into the Kingdom of Heaven\n\nWell, you see, the third Nun had been watching this and not feeling at all abashed she stormed up to Saint Peter and said \"NOW LISTEN HERE BUSTER ...

        "body": "He had decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had\ngreat fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a\nbig rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell\nphone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family,\nhis parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few\nfriends had no idea he was out here.\n\nHe stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out\nand he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now\nthat he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way\nwas north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go\nabout 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in\nlast.\n\nHe thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon\nhow dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no\nflashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So,\nhe puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication\nlater, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give\nhim a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle\nin case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a\ncactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the\ndirection he thinks is right.\n\nHe walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's\nbeen sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied\nthe sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels\nsunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket\nis really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some\nethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to\nit to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and\nwhether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.\n\nHe pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.\n\nBy the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been\nwalking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours.\nThat means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the\ntown. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed\na mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He\nfigures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry\ncreek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's\nclose, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of\nthese hills, and that'll be all he needs.\n\nAs it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things,\nhe finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.\n\nFull dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back\nup and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.\n\nHe wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy\nand his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he\ncan't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd\nforgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the\nnight before because he'd been in his car.\n\nHe knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without\nwater, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a\nlittle longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to\nwalk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures,\nunless he finds water, this is his last day.\n\nHe rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He\nwaits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes\nnumb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in\nhis mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't\nfind water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.\n\nThen he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from\nhere? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he\nstill knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no\nidea what to do.\n\nLooking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction\nhe was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat\nto the left of that, and starts walking.\n\nAs he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple\nof hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first,\nand then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating\nhe knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.\n\nHe decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait\nany longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large\nrock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly\nswallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry\nand cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes\nanother mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle.\nHe figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to\nmake some difference and keep himself from passing out.\n\nHe's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him,\nit kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty\nsure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed\nto make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid\nfor the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.\n\nHe walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills,\ndunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water.\nSometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever\nmoved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds,\nlizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's\ncareful to stay away from the movements.\n\nAfter a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat\nstroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the\nwiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep\ngoing.\n\nAfter more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He\nknows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing\ndonuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy\nenough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if\nhe's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it,\ntrying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.\n\nHe was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any\nmore. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still\nmorning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It\nmust be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.\n\nHe walks through the sand.\n\nAfter a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't\nremember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he\ndoesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.\n\nBut, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures\nthat he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from\nthere that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.\n\nHalfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third\ntime, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll\njust fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.\n\nWhile crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally\ngotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through\nthe sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines,\nif only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert\nin the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any\nrips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried\nin the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape -\nshake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes\nhis throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it\nhurts.\n\nHe finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top,\nhe struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees\nis sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he\nsees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more\ndunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close\nenough.\n\nAgain, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper\nfluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the\ncap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand.\nAt the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's\na flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and\ntries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker\nthan the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he\ncan't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from\nhere. He's going to have to go down there and look.\n\nHe puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune.\nAfter a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be\nable to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps,\nhe falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body\nhits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like\na movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it\never even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face\nwith his hands, and waits to stop rolling.\n\nHe stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough\nenergy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When\nhe clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot\nin the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.\n\nSo, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins\nto crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to\nhave the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages\nof dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't\nhave water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last\nchance.\n\nHe gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the\ndark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting\nhis head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just\nkeeps crawling.\n\nFinally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute\nof crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now\ncrawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it -\na pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what\nthe pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center,\nwhere his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone\narea.\n\nHis mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees\nare so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark\nstone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun\noverhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying\ndown on the nice cool surface.\n\nCool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's\nprobably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and\ndying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the\nbeautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him\na drink. Then he'll know he's gone.\n\nHe decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here\nin the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the\ncenter before he goes. He keeps crawling.\n\nIt's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's\nhearing. He would swear that someone just said, \"Greetings, traveler. You do\nnot look well. Do you hear me?\"\n\nHe stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and\nknees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something\ndifferent - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few\nseconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and\ntries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands\nand tries again. Better this time.\n\nYep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse\nof stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or\npole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet\nout of the stone, at an angle.\n\nAnd wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and\nseeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long\ndesert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.\n\nHe stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and\nrun away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his\nfinal resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to\nmove from this spot.\n\nWell, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than\ndying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a\nlittle straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves\nit in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a\nmoment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.\n\nHmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet -\nthat was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.\n\nHe then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here\nbecause he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was\nlikely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was\nnow on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had\nactually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white\npost sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe\nthey were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake\nwas even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.\n\nHe tries to clear his throat to say, \"Hello,\" but his throat is too dry. All\nthat comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going\nto be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the\nbottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out,\nalmost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't\ngood. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes\nout.\n\nHe gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips,\nand pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then\nswallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk\nnow.\n\nHe tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to\nspot the owner of this place, and croaks out, \"Hello? Is there anyone here?\"\n\nHe hears, from his side, \"Greetings. What is it that you want?\"\n\nHe turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed\nto come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a\nspeaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides\nto try asking for help.\n\n\"Please,\" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, \"I'd love to not be\nthirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?\"\n\nLooking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was\ncoming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its\nmouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he\nfalls forward, face first on the stone, \"Very well. Coming up.\"\n\nA piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits\nup and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily\ndisoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the\nsand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped\naround the tilted white post, still looking at him.\n\nHe reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet.\nHe pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder\nagain - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes -\nthey match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been\nbitten. By the snake.\n\n\"It'll feel better in a minute.\" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He\nhadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more\nimportantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!\n\n\"Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the\nafterlife?\"\n\n\"Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,\" says the snake. \"That's the way I\nwork. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.\"\n\n\"You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a\ndrink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be\nthirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for\nthe windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk?\nAre you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?\"\n\n\"No,\" says the snake, \"I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I\ndidn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I\nbite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just\nsitting around here.\"\n\nThe man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the\ndesert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a\nsnake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not\ngreat - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no\nlonger thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt\nhot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool\nstone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer\ndying of thirst.\n\n\"I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your\nsystem with the next request,\" continued the snake. \"I can guess why you\ndrank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left\nin the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or\ntwo, if you drank enough of it.\"\n\n\"Ummm, n-next request?\" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting\nshoulder and backed away from the snake a little.\n\n\"That's the way it works. If you like, that is,\" explained the snake. \"You\nget three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish.\" The snake grinned at his\nown joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.\n\n\"But there are rules,\" the snake continued. \"The first request is free. The\nsecond requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of\nresponsibility.\" The snake looks at the man seriously.\n\n\"By the way,\" the snake says suddenly, \"my name is Nathan. Old Nathan,\nSamuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound\nused to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand\nfor it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into\nnames. You can call me Nate, if you wish.\" Again, the snake grinned. \"Sorry\nif I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds\nsomewhat threatening.\" The snake give his rattle a little shake.\n\n\"Umm, my name is Jack,\" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. \"Jack\nSamson.\n\n\"Can I ask you a question?\" Jack says suddenly. \"What happened to the\npoison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that?\nWhat do you mean by that's how you work?\"\n\n\"That's more than one question,\" grins Nate. \"But I'll still try to answer\nall of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question.\" The snake's grin gets\nwider. \"Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need\nto drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not\nbe thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make\nit permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at\nall. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to\nget enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert.\nYou've been changed.\n\n\"For the third question,\" Nate continues, \"you are still dying. Besides the\neffects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal.\nIn your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years.\nAssuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is.\" Nate seemed vastly\namused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.\n\n\"As for the fourth question,\" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack\ncould tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read\ntalking-snake emotions from snake facial features, \"first you have to agree\nto make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell\nyou.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" joked Jack, \"isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd\nhave to kill me?\"\n\n\"I thought that was implied.\" Nate continued to look serious.\n\n\"Ummm...yeah.\" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was\ntalking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a\nnasty temper. \"So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really\nstop the effects of the methanol?\" Jack thought for a second. \"And, what do\nyou mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper\nfluid, and just denature it?\"\n\n\"They may, I don't really know,\" said Nate. \"I haven't gotten out in a\nwhile. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and\non that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you\npulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume\nthat they still color wiper fluid blue?\"\n\n\"Yeah, they do,\" said Jack.\n\n\"I figured,\" replied Nate. \"As for being bound by secrecy - with the\nfulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me,\nthis place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you\ndecide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me,\nwrite about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will\nlead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of\ncourse, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm\nguessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding\nanyway, so you won't notice.\" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.\n\nJack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a\nlittle nervous at this. \"Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know\nthat? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?\"\n\nWell, Jack,\" said Nate sadly, \"I can't tell you that, unless you make the\nsecond request.\" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.\n\n\"Umm, well, ok,\" said Jack, \"what is this about a second request? What can I\nask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?\"\n\n\"Sure!\" said Nate, brightening. \"You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes\nto yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and\nbefore you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or\nomnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous\nand yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and\nsort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be\nomniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very\nuseful, at least in my opinion.\" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was\nstaring at him.\n\n\"Well, anyway,\" continued Nate, \"I'd probably suggest giving you permanent\ngood health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be\nimmune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long\ntime, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to\nrecover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a\nrequest to me.\"\n\n\"Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?\" said Jack. \"And keep me healthy for a\nlong time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request\nabout a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not\nreally a change to me?\"\n\n\"Right,\" nodded Nate.\n\n\"Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?\" Jack asked, hopefully.\n\n\"That takes two requests, Jack.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I figured so,\" said Jack. \"But I could ask to be a genius? I could\nbecome the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?\"\n\n\"Well, I could make you very smart,\" admitted Nate, \"but that wouldn't\nnecessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you\nvery athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either.\nYou've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some\ntruth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It\nall depends on what you decide to do with it.\"\n\n\"Hmmm,\" said Jack. \"Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request,\nafter this one?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Nate, \"it depends on what you decide then. There are more\nrules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second\nrequest. You know how it goes.\" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had\nshoulders.\n\n\"Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent\nhealth doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially.\nDo I need to sign in blood or something?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Nate. \"Just hold out your hand. Or heel.\" Nate grinned. \"Or\nwhatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said,\nthat's how it works - the poison, you know,\" Nate said apologetically.\n\nJack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it\ndidn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better\nabout the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot\nsnake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to\nbe able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack\ntried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it\nwouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.\n\n\"Hey, Jack,\" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind\nhim, \"is that someone else coming up over there?\"\n\nJack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of\nnowhere? And did they bring food?\n\nWait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...\n\nJack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through\nhis jeans...\n\nJack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. \"I would have\ndecided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to\nhoodwink me like that.\"\n\n\"I've been doing this a long time, Jack,\" said Nate, confidently. \"You\nhumans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you -\nespecially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of\nminutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the\nhealth benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, still,\" said Jack, \"it's the principle of the thing. And nobody\nlikes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or\nsomething instead?\"\n\n\"More meat in the typical human butt,\" replied Nate. \"And less chance you\naccidentally kick me or move at the last second.\"\n\n\"Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify\nto hear,\" answered Jack.\n\n\"Ok,\" said Nate. \"Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to\njust start talking?\"\n\n\"Just talk,\" said Jack. \"I'll sit here and try to not think about food.\"\n\n\"We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,\"\nanswered Nate.\n\n\"Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!\" Jack jumped up.\n\"What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically\nwhip up food along with your other powers?\" Jack was almost shouting with\nexcitement. His stomach had been growling for hours.\n\n\"I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite\nit for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife,\nthat is,\" replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to.\n\n\"Ugh,\" said Jack, sitting back down. \"I think I'll pass. I can last a little\nlonger before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it\nis you find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw.\nNo thanks. Just talk.\"\n\n\"Ok,\" replied Nate, still grinning. \"But I'd better hurry, before you start\nlooking at me as food.\n\nNate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued.\n\"You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden.\"\n\n[.... continued in comments.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2psosp/so_theres_a_man_crawling_through_the_desert/cmzn3c0)",

Well, let me assure you, that just isn't true. We'll use your skin to make our excellent canoes, your hair to make twine, and we'll eat every edible part of you. So really, it's not a waste at all.

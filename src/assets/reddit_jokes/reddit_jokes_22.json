When  she was completely disrobed on the operating table, the  staff noticed that her pubic hair had been dyed green and  above it there was a tattoo that read . . .'Keep off the grass.'

The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully.\n\nHe got down on one knee, inspected the elephant's foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot. The elephant turned to face the man, and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.\n\nTwenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenage son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring intently at him.\n\nRemembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing, and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter's legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.\n\nProbably wasn't the same elephant.",

        "body": "There once was a man named Yuri.\n\nYuri had lived in Russia all of his life, in a small town near Moscow. The town had horrible weather conditions almost all of the time and very few people lived there. Everyone living in the town was struggling to survive in such poor conditions. Yuri had lived alone in a small house in this town. He worked every day at a factory that was close to this town. It was hard work, and Yuri was never very happy with his work, but he kept enduring the rough conditions to be able to have an income. Yuri's life had been like this for several years, and he had endured many hardships during these times.\n\nEvery day, while Yuri was taking his walk to the factory before work began, he always passed by a large billboard on the side of the road. The billboard changed every month or so, usually showing an irrelevant advertisement for something that Yuri had little interest in. Today, however, Yuri noticed a new advertisement on the billboard. It read, \"SWIMMING LESSONS\" in large letters, accompanied by a picture of a large man swimming through the water. This ad had given Yuri something to be interested in. He had always had an intense passion for swimming, but it was always too difficult to practice in the frigid waters of the lake near his home. Yuri continued to read the ad before he finally came to the price: 5000 Rubles base fee.\n\nYuri was sad, because this was much more than Yuri could afford to spend. However, he thought to himself, \"If I could save up enough money from the factory work, then by the end of the month, I should have enough...\" After this, he decided that day that he would work as hard as he could to make sure he had enough money by the end of the month. He even had to cut back his food supply by just a small amount to still have enough money.  Finally, at the end of the month, Yuri finally had enough money to be able to go to the swimming pool not far from his home where the practices were being held.\n\nEvery day after his hard work at the factory, he greatly enjoyed going back to the pool and practicing his swimming. He had started quickly and advanced rapidly. Everyone who frequented the pool to practice their swimming was impressed by Yuri's natural ability to be able to learn and adapt so quickly, becoming very popular with the people at the pool, his hometown, and even in Moscow. It was truly a passion of Yuri's.\n\nA few months had passed, and Yuri's amazing swimming abilities had been noticed by people in places all across Russia, considering a swimming prodigy. Yuri was always modest about his skills, but was humble nonetheless. However, he still had to continue his work at the factory, and live in the same small house he had lived in since he was born. For him, swimming was the one thing that saved him from the cruel and harsh life he lived. \n\nLater that month, on his way to the factory once again, he had noticed that the billboard he so often passed had changed once again. While it was difficult to read in the unrelenting snowstorm, he managed to make out the words \"DIVING PRACTICES\" in big letters. Diving was something that Yuri had also found to be interesting, but could never find the time nor place to practice properly. The pool he went to had no diving boards or excessively deep sections of the pool, so it was hard for Yuri to practice diving. However, this would give him another opportunity to pursue what he wanted to do. He looked down at the bottom of the billboard and saw something that, like the other ad, made his heart drop. The base fee was 7500 Rubles.\n\nYuri knew that it would take another month or two of hard work at the factory to be able to achieve such a high sum of money. The factory was beginning to offer less and less money to Yuri, making life harder on him than it was before. He had to cut back his food money as well to accommodate for this. However, Yuri overcame the hardships in his life and save up just enough money by the end of two months.\n\nThe practices were held at another pool not far from the one he already went to, so it was easy for him to practice both swimming and diving at once. He continued to master his swimming skills while also learning how to practice diving. Much like with swimming, however, he had picked up skills quickly, and it only took him another few months before he had mastered diving.\n\nMany people had heard of Yuri at this point. Several news stories across Russia were focused around Yuri, who was considered to be the best swimmer and diver in the whole country. He continued to remain incredibly modest through all of his interviews. \"It is only something I am fond of, a hobby\" Yuri would say. \"I still have a life in the factory that I must attend to every day. It is a hard life, so swimming and diving are what I use to keep myself healthy.\" Despite his fame and popularity, Yuri did continue to work at the factory day in and day out, receiving little pay and little food for all of his hard work. Despite all of Yuri's hardships, he continued his daily routine of working, swimming, and diving.\n\nFor yet another time, Yuri was on his way to the factory. The billboard had changed once again. Yuri anticipated something exciting on the billboard, and he was not disappointed at what he saw. \"TRAVEL TO AMERICA TODAY!\" read the ad. Yuri was very interested. He had always heard of America, and had heard nothing but positive things about it. The land of the free! It was a very exciting idea to Yuri. However, he knew that with ads like these, he knew they would come at a steep price. Unfortunately, he thought correctly. The boats that traveled to America were advertised as costing 60,000 Rubles.\n\nYuri knew that that kind of sum would come from only another year or so of hard work at the factory. The factory work had become increasingly more difficult every single day, with little pay, food, and free time. However, he endured the next year the same way he endured the previous years: with swimming and diving. It truly was his passion, and Yuri was not sure on how he would have survived without them.\n\nFinally, the year had passed, and Yuri had finally saved up enough Rubles to be able to ride the boat to America. He climbed aboard the boat with all of his possessions with him, all managing to fit in one small suitcase. The boat was somewhat small in size, being able to house only around 20 or so people. The boat set sail across the cold waters of the ocean. About a day had passed when people had finally recognized Yuri, the famed Russian swimmer and diver. They were all very excited to meet Yuri, and had several questions to ask him about his swimming skills. \"It is nothing much, just a passion of mine, that is all. It is something I use to endure the hardships and trials of my life...\" Yuri would always respond to his fans.\n\nOne day the boat had to make a stop at a small island to fill up the boat's gas supply, for they had much less than they had expected to have. It was a nice, sunny day outside, and the water was said to be very warm. One of the passengers asked Yuri to show off some of his diving techniques to his fans, since they had time to kill before the boat would depart again. \"Hey, Yuri! While we wait, could you show us some of your diving skills? I would LOVE to see them!\" Yuri was hesitant at first. Another passenger asked, \"And maybe once you have done that, could you show us your swimming techniques? The water is warm, and it would make my day to see them!\" Yuri replied, \"Well... ok, if you all insist I do it.\"\n\nYuri looked off the side of the boat. On the bottom of the boat, a balcony extended from the bottom. Yuri feared he might hit the balcony on his dive down, but everyone else assured Yuri that he wouldn't hit it in a million years. Yuri stepped up over the railing, onto the side of the boat. With the same skill that he had used so many times before, he demonstrated his graceful diving skills by performing his favorite dive he knew. His fans watched in amazement as his body twirled through the air beautifully, showing the same amount of skill he put into each of his other dives. As he dove down towards the war waters below, people watched and expected for Yuri to land smoothly in the water.\n\nUnfortunately, Yuri never landed in the water. He landed instead on the solid, hard deck of the boat's balcony below. The impact sounded painful, and all of the spectators winced on pain over his fall. Yuri remained motionless for several seconds, and his fans began to worry. Many people were about to call for medics when Yuri managed to get up slowly. \"Are you alright Yuri? That fall looked hard! That must have broken some bones!\" Yuri, however, had barely an injury. As he had gotten up, he simply regained his sense of direction. This had amazed several people, as that kind of a fall would have surely broken any other person's bones, if not killed them. Instead, Yuri simply stood up with barely a scratch, and waved back at the row of spectators.\n\n\"It is OK, everybody\" Yuri yelled back. \"I have endured many hardships in my life.\"",

He bought a plane ticket, but fell short on funds. \n\nBeing a thrifty man, never wanting to live in debt, he sold a chair from his house to pay for the ticket. When he got on the plane, he found that he couldn't take the dog without preparations; the airline, however, was willing to transfer his ticket for a nominal fee. He was forced to pay this fee, and the veterinarian's bills, with a credit card, which irked him even though he knew the reward would offset it. \n\nThen he flew to the city in question, but since he was only twenty-four, had to walk ten miles through the woods, going in the general direction of the manor. When he arrived, he found he had missed the front gate entirely. He walked directly up to the door with the dog and rang the bell... when he and the dog were shot dead by a guard. The end!",

However because the tribe subscribes to the waste not want not philosophy,  the chieftan tells the trio that their deaths will not be in vain. Their bodies will be used. The meat will feed the tribe and their skin will line the canoes so the tribe may fish. \n\nThe chieftan asks which of the trio is willing to go first and because he's not an ass he is willing to grant them all a final wish, and to decide on the order of the it demise.\n\nThe priest offers to go first and requests a moment of prayer before he is killed.  The chieftan obliges and the priest goes off to say a rosary. When he returns he is killed, skinned, put in a stew and the tribe's tanners set to work on prepping his skin for lining the canoes.\n\nThe Irishman is next and asks for a pint of their strongest liquor. The chief obliges and the Irishman meets the same fate as the priest.\n\nFinally the New Yorker is up and he asks for a fork. Confused, the chieftan asks the New Yorker what a fork is since the tribe has no idea what a fork is.  The New Yorker draws a fork in the sand and the chieftan instructs his men to make the man a fork.  All are very confused.\n\nWhen the fork is completed the chieftan hands the New Yorker the fork and asks why the man wants that for, of all things,  his last request on this earth.\n\nThe New Yorker smiles,  grasps the fork by the handles and aims the tines toward his chest and violently stabs him self over and over again in the chest shouting,  \"This is what I think of your fucking canoe!\"",

        "body": "A young man meets a beautiful girl and asks her out on a date. He is surprised when she says yes, and they decide to go out that Saturday. So the young man goes home, and spends the remainder of the week agonizing over what to do on their date. Should they go to dinner? A movie? Roller skating? Skydiving? Maybe go on a big game hunt? He has no idea. Finally Saturday comes, and as he is driving over to pick her up, he notices a sign saying that the Big Top is in town. He immediately knows that\u2019s where they need to go. \n\nSo he picks up his date, radiant as ever, and they head to the Circus. She\u2019s incredibly excited, as she hasn\u2019t been since she was a child. They buy cotton candy, popcorn, peanuts, big drinks, and make their way to the front row, where he managed to get tickets. The two watch in amazement as the dancing horses come out, followed by bears balancing on large rubber balls, then the elephants. They watch in trepidation as the lion tamer whips and yells at the lion, as the trapeze artists fly to and fro. They watch delightedly as finally the clowns make their way to the center of the ring. They bound about acrobatically, juggle while riding the unicycle, and joke with the crowd. The head clown notices the young man in the front row with the beautiful girl, and comes strolling over.\n\nAs he motions for the attention of the crowd, he leans toward the young man and says:\n\n\u201cHey mister, are you the horse\u2019s head?\u201d\n\nAnd the young man replies \u201cWell\u2026no\u201d\n\nSo the head clown says, \u201cWell that must make you the horse\u2019s ass!\u201d\nThe whole tent erupts with laughter at the young man, who is absolutely humiliated. Even his date is laughing. He tries to hide his anger, and pretends it doesn\u2019t bother him. But he spends the rest of the evening fuming over the joke. He barely even notices that his date kisses him good night when he drops her off. \n\nThat night, the young man is unable to sleep. Lying in bed, he can think of nothing other than the clown. Why didn\u2019t he say something? Why didn\u2019t he stand up for himself? He has no answers, and finally falls asleep, dreaming of destroying the clown.\n\nThe next morning, the young man wakes up with a deep sense of purpose. Never in his life has he felt such drive. He will dedicate his life to getting back at the clown. He heads out the door, and immediately enrolls in university, majoring in Comebackology.\n\nThe young man gives his classes everything he\u2019s got. He quickly rises to the top of his class, a star pupil. He wows his professors during finals, and is even crowned Valedictorian upon graduation, receiving his Bachelor of Science in Comebackology.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t feel ready. So he redoubles his efforts, and goes back to school, continuing to impress the faculty. After an amazingly quick year, he is awarded his Master\u2019s Degree in Comebackology, the fastest it has ever been awarded. But still, he believes that he needs to become the greatest Comeback master who ever lived before he gets his revenge. So he continues his education, writing his PhD thesis on the \u201cAmbiguities of the modern riposte: Is brevity still the soul of wit?\u201d His professors are dumbfounded by the brilliance of the paper. He is lauded throughout the country as one of the preeminent Comebackologists, even asked to be on talk shows. The fame is staggering.\n\nBut the boy, now a man, doesn\u2019t feel as though he is ready. He still seethes inside at the humiliation the clown dealt him. Nothing but the absolute verbal destruction of the clown will pacify him.\n\nSo he leaves the country, and begins studying with old Comeback masters around the world. But at each and every stop, he finds that he has surpassed them all. They have nothing left to teach him. But there are rumors of the greatest Comeback master alive, hidden away in the mountains of Nepal. For years the man searches him out, following clues and half remembered stories. His perseverance pays off, however, and he finds himself, exhausted and nearly dead, at the entrance to a great wooden temple built into a mountain. He is welcomed inside by the master himself, who had known that this day would come. The master is elated that a student worthy of his teachings has finally found him. The two become fast friends, working together day and night, meditating on the most ethereal of comebacks, the God Comebacks. 15 years the man spends there, until finally the master dies, happily bequeathing his title to his only pupil. The man takes one final look at his old master, then squaring his shoulders, heads out the door and down the mountain. He is finally ready.\n\nThe man goes back home, welcomed by family and friends, who had long believed him dead. He calls up the same young lady he had taken out all those years before, and incredibly, she is still single, and willing to go out again. \n\nSo he picks up his date, radiant as ever, and they head to the Circus. She\u2019s incredibly excited, as she hasn\u2019t been since her first date with the man. They buy cotton candy, popcorn, peanuts, big drinks, and make their way to the front row, where he again managed to get tickets. The two watch in amazement as the dancing horses come out, followed by bears balancing on large rubber balls, then the elephants. They watch in trepidation as the lion tamer whips and yells at the lion, as the trapeze artists fly to and fro. They watch delightedly as finally the clowns make their way to the center of the ring. They bound about acrobatically, juggle while riding the unicycle, and joke with the crowd. The head clown, still the same man, after all of these years, recognizes the man in the front row with the beautiful girl, and comes strolling over.\n\nAs he motions for the attention of the crowd, he leans toward the young man and says:\n\n\u201cHey mister, are you the horse\u2019s head?\u201d\n\nAnd the young man replies \u201cWell\u2026no\u201d\n\nSo the head clown says, \u201cWell that must make you the horse\u2019s ass!\u201d\n\nThe whole tent erupts with laughter at the man. Even his date is laughing. But he is unruffled. He stands up, looks at the clown, waits for the laughter to die down and says:\n\n\u201cHey clown\u2026Fuck you!\u201d\n",

He gets his flashlight and starts walking. He finds a  monastery nearby.  He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, \"My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?\". The monks at the monastery generously accept him, feed him dinner, and they give him a place to sleep. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. He couldn't tell what the sound was, it was both disturbing yet soothing, dark but innocent, malicious yet amazing, cold and creepy yet warm and welcoming. The man was bewildered by the sweet but yet somehow frightening sound. The next morning, he asks the monks about the sound, but they say \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\" The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way...\n\nSome years later, the same man was again driving down the same road and again his car breaks down in front of the same monastery.  The monks again accept him, feed him. Again that night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard all those years earlier, and it was as enchanting as he had heard it all those years ago. The next morning, he asks the monks about the sound, but the monks reply, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\" The man frustrated says, all right, all right. I'm dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is by becoming  a monk, then I will, tell me, how do I become a monk? The monks look at each other whisper something among themselves and reply, you must travel to an Island and live there for about 10 years, you must learn about the meaning of life, and when you do, you will become a monk. The man sets about his task. Some years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, I have traveled the earth and found what you have asked me. The monk who was the oldest and the wisest asks \"what is the meaning of life? The man walks up to the monk and whispers two words in his ear. The monk smiles and replies  \"Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound\". The monks lead the man to a wooden door. The old monk says,\"The sound is right behind that door. The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says ,\"Real funny, may I have the key?\".The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door was another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key,  and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire, and this went on and on until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, amethyst and a whole lot more\u2026 \n\nFinally, they reach a large door made of an unknown white substance, the monks say, \"This is the last door\".

After he got to his hotel, he farted and strangely it sounded like his ass said \"Honda\". Puzzled, he forced out another fart and sure enough it came out \"hooonda\". Needless to say he was freaked out by this. Every time he farted, it came out \"hooonda\". He flipped through the phone book and found an American doctor and rushed over. The doctor listened to his bizarre farts, examined him thoroughly then proclaimed he was completely stumped. He sent the salesman to a Japanese doctor that specialized in rare diseases, but this doctor too didn't have a clue. He made an emergency appointment with a gastroenterologist. He too was baffled. On his way out of the last doctor's office, he was panicking. He had to cancel the meeting. How embarrassing would it be if in the middle of the chairman of Toyota's office he let a fart slip and it came out \"hooonda\"!  Just before he went out of the office door, the receptionist called after him. \"The doctor recommends you try going to a dentist.\" \"A dentist?\", he thought. What the heck. He was desperate at this point so he called a local dentist. When he arrived and described his problem to the old Japanese dentist, the dentist nodded his head and said \"you have abscessed tooth.\" \"An abscessed tooth?!?\", the incredulous salesman says. \"Why the hell do you say that?\" To which the dentist replied, \"Everybody knows abscess make the fart go Honda,\"",

Lou had never felt the kind of affection for Lorraine that he felt for Claire.  He felt terrible thinking it, but he wished and wished for Lorraine to go away.  \n\nThen it happened.  He woke up one morning from the couch, where he always slept.  He went up to make coffee and get breakfast.  He found it strange that Lorraine hasn't yelled from the bedroom to bring her breakfast.  He opened the bedroom door and saw her in bed, still asleep.  He went over to her and nudged her, to get her attention.  She was cold to the touch.  He shook her, and she didn't respond.  She was dead.  A moment of calm settled in, with perhaps a second of grief.  After that, he formed a grin and his eyes widened.

A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and confirmed that it was NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. However, during the analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analysing these paint residues it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by trucks, while only 2% were killed by cars. The MRD then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills. The O.B quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of impending danger. They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout \"Cah\", not a single one could shout \"Truck\".",

And the ocean parts, and out walks this gorgeous woman in this beautiful dress, and she takes my hand and we fall in love and the genie marries us right there. It was incredible. \n\n\"The genie booms, 'You have one wish remaining.'\" \n\nThe man with the big orange head pauses and sips his beer. He says, \"Now, you know, this may be where I went wrong.

No matter how much I tell people they're going to HATE me for telling them this joke, they still insist on wanting to hear it.  Every. Single. Time.  \n\nWhy I'm volunteering to get down-voted to Hell, I dunno, but many of those that I tell this joke to eventually run into a situation where they too share this joke (usually at a party to people who are annoying them).  To the best of my knowledge, my friend Dave made this up at a party in high school, while totally baked, and told it for 20 minutes.  (He was telling it to some annoying pretty cheerleader-types, who were trying to be \"cool\" and hang out with / get high with the skateboard guys.  You know the type.  I *think* he made this up on the spot to fuck with him; he didn't give a shit.  I was simultaneously awed and thought it was the funniest shit in the entire world when he was done.  No, I was not also baked.)  Be forewarned, this is a LONG joke, and ya know, the aforementioned hating me at the end:\n\n\nThere once was a man who was the Supreme Emperor of the Universe.  He owned literally every THING, and every person was his slave and every planet his playground.  There was literally nothing he could ever want or couldn't do that wasn't his to be had or to be done.  And this Supreme Emperor had but one son, who he lavished his affection and gifts upon.\n\nAnd so it came, on the day of his only son's 15th birthday, that he summoned his child to his throne room.\n\n\"Son,\" the Emperor said, \"Today is your 15th birthday.  For your present, I will give to you anything you wish to have in my universe.  Whatever your heart's desire, I have the power to make it so.  For what do you wish?  1,000 slave girls to do with as you please?  A planet to call your own?  Whatever you want is yours but to ask.  So my son, what do you wish for on this, your 15th birthday?\"\n\nThe Emperor sits back on his platinum throne, eagerly awaiting his son's decision, pleased with himself, content with the knowledge that soon he will make his son happy by providing him anything that he desires from his grand empire.\n\nAnd so, the son thinks long, thinks hard, thinks long some more.... and finally.... comes to a decision.\n\n\"Dad?'\n\n\"Yes son?\n\n\"I have thought about what you have offered.  And I have come to a decision.\"\n\n\"Yes son, whatever you wish, whatever you want - name it and it is yours - I will command it!\"\n\n\"I thank you for your generosity father.  For this, my 15th birthday, I would like....\n\n\"Yes???\"\n\n.... a pink golf ball.\"\n\nThe Emperor can scarcely believe his son's request.  Incredulously, he says \"Son, I can provide you with all your wildest dreams, anything in this cosmos or the next, all yours but to ask!  And all that your heart desires........ is... a pink golf ball?\"\n\nSolemnly, the boy answers.  \"Yes Father, I have thought this through and I am certain: 1 pink golf ball and I shall be content.\"\n\nThe Emperor, perplexed, nevertheless, grants his son's request.  \"So be it.  I shall provide to you.... a pink golf ball.\"\n\nAnd so it came, in the following year, on the day of his only son's 16th birthday, that he once again summoned his child to his throne room.\n\n\"Son,\" the Emperor said, \"Today is your 16th birthday.  For your present, I will give to you anything you wish to have in my universe.  Whatever your heart's desire, I have the power to make it so.  For what do you wish this year?  Do you NOW wish to have 1,000 slave girls to do with as you please?  Or NOW a planet to call your own?  Whatever you want is yours but to ask.  So my son, what do you wish for on this, your 16th birthday?\"\n\nThe Emperor once again sits back on his platinum throne, eagerly awaiting his son's decision, pleased with himself, content with the knowledge that soon he will make his son happy this year by providing him anything that he desires from his grand empire.\n\nAnd so, the son thinks long, thinks hard, thinks long some more.... and finally.... comes to a decision.\n\n\"Dad?'\n\n\"Yes son?\n\n\"I have thought about what you have offered.

For this, my 16th birthday, I would like....\n\n\"Yes???\"\n\n.... a case of pink golf balls.\"\n\nThe Emperor can, again, scarcely believe his son's request.  Incredulously, he says \"Son, I can provide you with all your wildest dreams, anything in this cosmos or the next, all yours but to ask!  And all that your heart desires........ is... a case of pink golf balls?\"\n\nSolemnly, the boy answers.  \"Yes Father, I have thought this through and I am certain: 1 case of pink golf balls and I shall be content.\"\n\nThe Emperor, perplexed again, nevertheless, grants his son's request.  \"So be it.  I shall provide to you.... a case of pink golf ball.\"\n\n**Okay, here's where I stop the joke and give you some pointers.  You've got to tell this to drunk people.  They'll be dying to know why the kid wants the pink golf balls, and will want you to continue.  You can stretch out the same setup for each birthday for as long as you can get away with, with each year the son's requests just being more and more outlandish pink-golf ball related things:\n\nA Truck full of pink golf balls\nA Warehouse of pink golf balls\nA Factory that make nothing but pink golf balls\nFinally, a PLANET that is nothing but one giant factory that does nothing but make pink golf balls**\n\nAnd so, on the occasion of the son's ____ birthday (*however long you've successfully stretched this out), the Supreme Emperor decided to visit his son on the pink-golf-ball-factory-planet he had given him.\n\nOn the way to the his son's office, the Emperor's convoy is struck by a speeding pink-golf-ball-carrying truck.  The Emperor is stunned to learn that it was his son driving, coming to meet him, and that his son now lay dying in the wreckage.  He hurries to him.\n\nStricken, he looks down at his only son.  \"Son, you are dying,\" he chokes out.\n\n\"Yes... I know Father,\" the son manages to say.\n\n\"Son, I must know, before you pass.  Why?  WHY the pink golf balls?  WHY THE GODDAMN PINK GOLF BALLS?\"\n\nAnd the son takes his last breath, says \"uggh,\" and dies.",

Bush administration.  It requires that passwords of Democratic Party members have least 5 uppercase characters, 9 lowercase characters, 7 numeric digits, 6 non-printable characters, 8 floating point numbers and 4 Shift JIS characters.  Also, passwords cannot appear in a dictionary of any language, they expire twice a day, and the same one can never be used twice.  Republicans, on the other hand, in view of their backing of the Patriot Act, are allowed to use zero-character passwords that never expire.\n\nClinton\u2019s frustration came to a head after taking a selfie in the President\u2019s Oval Office chair while the President stepped out for a bio break.  \u201cI tried to email it to my 2016 election campaign staff as a joke, when I discovered that I was locked out of my email for the third time that morning.

Massachusetts' Dept. of Environmental Protection just completed a study of the problem. The crows are being killed when they are struck by trucks, but they manage to avoid being hit by passenger cars. Since crows are scavengers they eat roadkill and are often in large groups on the roads. Being social animals, they are somewhat organized and one or two birds always serve as lookouts to warn the others of danger.

He left it in there a few seconds then pulled it out and showed it to them. he then said you had to judge by the warmth you felt inside along with the taste and he stuck his finger in his mouth and sucked on it. More students puked of course. He then told them to do the procedure that he had done on the corpse for practice and reluctantly each one slowly shuffled by, stuck their finger in its ass and then into their mouth. once they had all finished he told them that another important thing about doing an autopsy on a dead person was observation.

The lady's about to leave when she notices that there's a Parrot in the back of the shop.\n\n'Hey! There's a Parrot in the back of the shop! Why did you lie?!', the lady protests.\n\n'He's not for sale ma'am!', Luca replies. \n\n'I'll pay you double!'\n\n'It's not that, he's not a good pet'\n\n'What do you mean?'\n\n'He was born and brought up in a meth lab. He's really bad mannered. Take a look yourself!'\n\n'OK!'\n\n'Tony, how does this pretty lady look like?', Luca asks the parrot. \n\n'Like a slut!', he replies back. \n\n'What! What did he say?', goes the lady. \n\nRealizing that she was hurt, Luca goes and brings a big tub of water.\n\n'I'm warning you Tony, you better behave and greet her well or I'll immerse you in the tub. Again, how does our Madam look like?'\n\n'Like a big slutty bitch!', Tony continues. \n\nLuca grabs him by the neck and rinses him.\n\n'Again, how does this lady look like?'\n\n'Like a fucking slut!'\n\nLuca dips him in even longer and asks, how does our beautiful Madam look like Tony?\n\n'Gasping, as... I said... a slut... as a fucking... slut!'\n\nLuca gets really angry at the embarrassment of his customer and drowns Tony till he almost passes out. Facing a near death experience, the Parrot is scared and his blood ran cold.\n\n'Last time. How does she look?'\n\nStuttering... 'B.. Be.. Beautiful! Like a.. an angel!' \n\nSurprised, Luca asks another question. 'Any comments on her character.' \n\n'She's like an angel. Anything I say would be demeaning. I pray that she makes everyone's day as beautiful as she is!'\n\n'Well I think he's better now, if you want to buy him, I'd be glad to sell him.'\n\n'I'm not convinced. I want to ask my own questions, lady replies. 'If I fuck my husband day and night and still am not satisfied then what would you call me?' \n\n'Well it's pretty common. You're hard to please and that's a great character to have. You have sex with your husband that's really normal', the parrot responds. \n\n'Okay, but I also have a boyfriend on the side.'\n\n'Your husband has failed to satisfy you so you have a boyfriend. That's something I can support. It's fine.'\n\n'But I also occasionally sleep with my husband's best friend.'\n\n'Umm, you are truly hard to satisfy. You love to explore new options perhaps. This is something I can understand.'\n\n'And my neighbor just fucks the hell out of me whenever he wants...'\n\n'Luca! Bring the bloody water back!

Before accepting his offer, the owner asked the man, \"What route did you take to get here?\"\n\n\"The one with the big hill\" responds the man.\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't take that route back if I was you. There is something funny with this horse. Whenever he's on top of a large hill, he will just sit there and it's impossible to move him. If yer gonna buy him, I'd take a different road home\".\n\nThe man buys the horse and thanks the owner. Heeding his advice, he takes a detour home through the woods. All is going well and the horse rides a dream. However, they get to a shallow stream and in the middle of crossing the stream, the horse stops and sits down, refusing to budge. The man tries everything he can to get the horse to move but to no avail. Puzzled, the man walks back to the marketplace where he bought the horse and quizzes the owner:\n\n\"That horse I bought, well I was riding it through the woods and all was going fine until we got to this stream and whilst crossing it, the horse just sat down and now it won't budge. Do you know why?\"\n\n\"Well\" the owner responds, \"there's something I forgot to mention; he sits on fish as well.\"",

Isn't he a sweet husband? I just love him. And then, while he was looking around the pool, I quickly sneaked back into the house and locked the door. Then the fun started.\n\nThen he shouted; \"Open the door or I will shout you B**ch!\"\n\nI  shouted back; \"Shout till all the neighbors wake up and come here. Then you tell them where you are coming from, this time of the night! And do it now that you're naked!\"\n\nThe next morning I found him sleeping in the bushes............joking!

The next morning he looks out and the pigs are still all standing around so he loads them up again and does the same thing. The following morning the pigs are still standing so he again takes them out and humps each one twice to make sure. \n\nThe next morning the farmer asks his wife to look and see what the pigs are doing, and asks her \"are the pigs still standing around, or are they laying in the mud?\"\n\nThe wife answers with \"neither, they are loaded up in the back of the truck and one is honking the horn.\"",

Slowly, they started building a new life on the island: they build a shelter, they find a source of water and food. Everything is going well as they are reaching a nice level of comfort. But after a few weeks, the stewardess goes talking to the steward and the captain and says: \"Guys, we've been living on this island for a few weeks now and we managed to provide for our vital needs, but I know that you, as much as I do, have other needs. So before we begin to fight about it, here's what I'm proposing you: captain, you can do it on the even days of week, and you steward can do it on the odd days of the week. And if there's anything wrong, we talk about it. What do you think? \" They both agree and so begins the sex triangle. They are now happier and more relaxed than before. But three weeks later, the stewardess gets sick and unfortunately dies. But life must go on for the captain and the steward, so they continue to live as they did when they first got on the island. A few weeks later though, the steward says to the captain : \"It's been tough since she died. And I'm tired of jacking myself off. I need to have sex. I can't take it anymore\". The captain looks in horror as to what the steward was implying towards and says \"I don't think I'm comfortable doing that.\" Steward then replied \"What other way do we have? Do you want to go back to jacking off? I don't think so..\" The captain agrees and they start satisfying their urges again. But a few days later, the captain comes up to the steward and says: \"-Man you said that if there was anything wrong we'd talk about it right? I must tell you that I don't feel really comfortable with what we're doing here \" \"-Actually me neither. As a matter of fact, I find it weird and against nature \" answers the steward.  \"-So what do we do now? \" \"-I think we should burry her\"",

First drive went 180 yards.  Second was another 40 to the tee!  15 feet and she got her best score!\n\nSo she's excited.  She says the the guys, \"you guys have been amazing.  You treated me like one of the guys.  This is the best game of my life.  Maybe even the best day!  If I sink this put I'll beat by personal best by a single shot!\"\n\n\"Here's your chance, guys.  Whoever gives me the best advice on this one gets a blow job behind the clubhouse.\"\n\nThe scientist says, \"this one's easy.  Take your club about 18\" back, swing through the ball and aim 6 inches to the right of the pin.  It'll go right in!\"\n\nThe engineer says, \"no, no, no!  You have to worry about ball speed.  Do what he said but flow through with the putter about 12 inches and it'll fall right in!\"\n\nThe businessman says, \"that's a gimme.\"\n\nMoral of the story: different realities for different people.",

They bickered between whether or not they should buy one or two percent milk, spent their Friday nights eating popcorn and watching Game of Thrones, took strolls through Pike Place Market to shop for fresh fruit and vegetables, struggled to decide whether or not Waikiki Wave Blue or Periwinkle Hideaway Purple would match their living room furniture the best, and more than anything they desperately wanted a child. Unfortunately for David and Joey, conceiving a child together wasn't as vexing as choosing the right color to match the living room furniture, this decision would require their full requited love and attention. After much deliberation, David and Joey decided to adopt a baby. After completing weeks of meetings with an agency's social worker, they successfully passed their Homestudy and were allowed the opportunity to adopt a child. After days of flipping through profile after profile of different children, David and Joey were at their wit's end as to who would fit best in their nonconventional family. That is until they fell upon Mercedes A Keema Robinson, an abandoned ten-month-old from Detroit. Their eyes glazed over with delight, knowing that she would be young enough to accept them as father and father in a loving, safe, and inclusive home. After picking up Mercedes from the adoption center on a hot August day, David and Joey decided to buy pizza and smoke a celebratory joint in honor of their transition from husbands to fathers. David dropped off Joey at their neighbor's/dealer's house to buy the weed, and he and Mercedes would go and grab the pizza. After David and Joey fell asleep watching Game of Thrones, David heard a loud knocking at the door. He slowly meandered his way to the front door, greeted by two police officers. \n\n\"Are you David Wachowski, owner of the 2009 Blue Toyota Prius parked in front?\"\n\n\"Yes. What's the matter officer?\"\n\n\"And that child that was in the car is yours?\"\n\nDavid looked outside to see an ambulance carting away his newly adopted, now deceased child. \n\n\"What happened? How could this be? I grabbed her right after bringing the pizza....\"\n\nDavid fell to the ground, realizing he forgot to go back out and grab Mercedes.\n\n\"David Wachowski, you have the right to remain silent....\" \n\n(two hours later)\n\n\"What's the consensus Detective Murphy?\"\n\n\"Well, Sergeant O'Hara, looks like the couple were inside smoking weed and fell asleep while their child was left in the car with the windows rolled up.\"\n\n \"Sounds like the couple weren't the only ones getting baked.\" ",

I'm pretty drunk, so I figure what the fuck and Jane and I go into the bedroom. She tells me she can give me the best blowjob I've ever gotten, while simultaneously singing God Bless America, but I'll have to turn off the lights and close the blinds so that the room is pitch black. I've *got* to experience this.\n\nSo I pay her and turn off the lights and the show begins. Holy shit, what a blowjob, and the voice on this girl was fucking incredible, but how did she do it? Truly amazing. The next day, I call her up and tell her that I'm still in town and I want another turn on the blowjob train and she agrees. I pay her the set rate and get the stunning BJ, while I start to hatch a plan in my mind. Luckily, I'm in town for one more day...\n\nSo the third day, I call up Jane and request the same transaction. She meets me, I get her into the hotel room and tell her I want it standing up this time, not in the bed. She agrees, and I position myself between the light switch and the coffee table. The awesomeness starts up and so does the singing, and about halfway into it, I flick on the light switch. \n\nThe first thing I see is her glass eye on the coffee table.",

He hadn't been there in a while and doesn't get out much, but when he does and he's a little tipsy he will play the biggest dumb ass there is with younger working kids and pretends like he was just dropped onto this earth. Some times it can be pretty funny and this one definitely took the cake. So we arrive and I already know what I want so I order.  Simple enough right? We all know how to order from subway, well not my dad... This is how his order went. \n\nkid: Welcome to subway what can I make for you!\n\nDad: Yea can I get one of those turkey melts, thanks!\n\nKid: Uhhh yes sir? What kind of bread, and is this a footlong?\n\n(Here's the first stupid card he plays. He's literally standing there looking at all the breads written down on the glass)\n\nDad: I didn't know you had more than one kind I thought it was just white bread? What others are there? \n\nKid names of all the breads and my dad just says white bread will be fine....then does the same thing with cheese and My dad had thought there was only American cheese... You guess what he got. My dad then asked for all the veggies on now at the begginning. This plays a part for Well...here's where shit really hit the fan. Take a listen\n\nKid: Sir would you like this heated?\n\nDad: What do you mean? Do I want it heated?\n\nKid: do you want me to put it in the oven?\n\nDad: Well I don't know son I don't work here? This is a turkey melt right, and turkey \"melts\" are usually heated or toasted in some sort of way. If the oven is your only means of heating this sandwich, then yes please I'd like it in the oven..\n\nThe kid just looks like he shit his pants and slowly turns to put the turkey melt in the oven. As he's doing this my dad says very clearly \" You stupid son of a bitch\". I know he heard him but his back was turned and didn't say anything. Needless to say the kid hurried up once it came out wrapped it up and only talked to me to pay for the sandwiches while my dad is starting to head for the door and right before he exits the door says \"Thanks bud\".

        "body": "Anne has been in the porn industry for well over a decade and is well-respected amongst her peers as a shrewd businesswoman. She has gone from being a production assistant to being a social media PR rep to being a director to owning her very own business. Her website caters to certain bizarre fetishes that many \"normal\" people would find repulsive, but despite the niche appeal, she pulls in a lot of money. And money is what matters to Anne Boleyn.\n\nAnne is married to man named Henry, fittingly enough. Henry is an infamous \"shock artist\" who inserts offensive images into things as a method of protest. For instance, he once stenciled a giant image of an oil-covered seal on the corporate offices of ExxonMobil. In another incident he hijacked a rightwing radio show's broadcasting frequency to play 10 hours of uninterrupted farting noises. A commentator once described him as \"Friedrich Engels with the mind of Howard Stern.\"\n\nHenry considers himself a radical champion of free speech. His art collective, named -- fittingly enough! -- \"The Church of England\" has attracted many followers, and he revels in his reputation as the art world's bad boy. You would therefore think Henry is the perfect match for Anne, since both of them are the sort who enjoy catering to fringe elements at the limits of free expression. But there's trouble in paradise: Henry is an avowed and vehement opponent of the porn industry, which he believes is one of modern humanity's most degrading forces. In fact, Henry met his future wife at the AVN Awards ceremony in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he dumped 100 gallons of horse urine on the stage while Anne was presenting the award for \"Best Painal Scene.\"\n\nLove blossomed in spite of, or perhaps because of, the friction between Anne and Henry. Their conversations have always become arguments; and their arguments are always frustratingly byzantine -- abstract, ideological, and at the same time viciously personal. They can agree on nothing, from the true purpose of art in human culture to what restaurant they should order Chinese takeout from. But these long evenings of arguing always end in bouts of grunting, banshee-wailing, Earth-shattering sex that no man, woman, or beast could ever possibly surpass. They love, and they bicker, and they love to bicker.\n\nAt first the two tried to keep the relationship secret, but when word of the marriage inevitably spread, Henry's art collective decried him for \"selling out\" and \"betraying the cause.\" The Church of England abandoned him, turning to a new leader: an anonymous graffiti artist who paints advice animals on national monuments, and who is known only by his alias \"Danksy.\" By now, Henry is considered a washed-up hack, and his work isn't taken seriously.\n\nAnne's colleagues reacted with similar hostility when they learned of the marriage, banning her and her new husband from industry events, stonewalling her whenever she scouted for new talent. Since then, Anne's website has suffered a preciptious downturn in new content, and with it a precipitous downturn in subscribers. Now, she finds herself on the point of bankruptcy.\n\nIt's at this point that you might expect Anne and Henry to circle their wagons -- to support one another through such trying times. You can imagine Anne's shock, then, when she receives a phone call from her web admin one evening telling her that the site has been hacked. Someone has replaced every video on the website with edited versions where swastikas and images of Hitler bounce around the screen whenever one of the actors achieves orgasm.\n\nSuch a bizarre and puerile act of vandalism could only have been committed by one person: Henry. Henry is trying to regain legitimacy in the world of performance art by attacking his own wife's website. Anne is not a stupid woman; she recognizes this at once. Furious, she decides to confront him.\n\nWhen Henry wakes up the following morning, he walks into the living room only to discover the TV playing a video of 300-pound teen lesbians shitting into each other's mouths. Anne is sitting on the couch, waiting.\n\n\"Was any of it real?\" Anne demands, half-shouting to be heard over the ecstatic gargling of actress Candi Chunks.\n\n\"Was what real?\" Henry says. \"Turn that off, will you?\"\n\n\"Did you marry me just for this? To get close enough to my site that you could pull this stunt? Is this all one of your stupid 'pieces'?\"\n\n\"Anne--\" Henry begins.\n\n\"That night at the lakeside when you said I was so beautiful that my existence made art redundant, were you playing some kind of con?\" Anne has to pause while actress Skyler Brown vomits with enough force to rattle the walls. \"Were you just saying whatever would make me let my guard down? How could you do this to me?\"\n\nHenry closes the distance between them and sits down beside her. He takes Anne's hands in his. She looks away. She tries not to let him see how hurt she is -- tries and fails. Her eyes well with tears.\n\nOn the TV, Candi and Skyler shriek their way through a septic orgasm. At the apex, a giant red swastika twirls and dances around the screen and a soundclip of Hitler's duck-like warbling replaces the audio track.\n\n\"You did this, didn't you?\" Anne says. She looks Henry dead in the eyes. \"Don't play stupid.\"\n\nHenry sighs. \"Anne, frankly, I *did* Nazi that cumming.\"",

It read:\n \n\"Dear Captain, Thursday will be my daughter's Debutante Ball.  I would like for you to send four (4) well-mannered, handsome, unmarried officers in their full formal dress uniforms to attend the dance. They must arrive promptly at 8:00 PM and be prepared to engage our guests in an evening of stimulating but polite Southern conversation.  They all should be excellent dancers, as they will be the escorts of a group of lovely refined young Southern belles. Please make note of one last important detail: \u201cAbsolutely NO JEWS.\"\n \nAfter reading and contemplating, the Navy Captain replied with a handwritten personal message that he had delivered to the Lady by yeoman. It read:\n\n\"Madam, thank you so much for your generous invitation. In order to present the widest possible knowledge base for an evening of polite, stimulating conversation, I am sending four (4) of my best and most impressive Officers.\n \nThe first young Officer I offer is a Lieutenant, with a Master\u2019s Degree in Computer Information Systems (CIS) from University of Texas at Austin (College of Natural Sciences). He is world-renown for his work with Integrated Quantum Materials (IQM) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and in establishing prototype deciphering benchmarks in the field of Advanced Technological and Cryptographic Algorithms. He is also awaiting notification on his Doctoral Dissertation (PhD) from Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. \n \nThe next Officer, another Lieutenant, proudly serves as one of our ships helicopter pilots. He is a graduate of Harvard University School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with a BS in Aeronautical Engineering. He also holds a PhD. in Mechanical, Aerospace, and Nuclear Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, New York. The Lieutenant was recently accepted into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Astronaut Candidate Selection Program which is quite an honor in its own right.\n \nThe third Lieutenant is a graduate of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis with an additional Master\u2019s Degree from The Pratt School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, Massachusetts. He also serves as a Navy expert in the field of Fluid Technology and Thermal Technology as it relates to Marine Turbine Engineering in Ship and Vessel Design.\n \nFinally, the fourth distinguished officer, a Lieutenant Commander, is our ship's Medical Doctor. He holds an undergraduate degree from the University of Virginia with his Medical Degree from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. The Doctor is also well respected in the field of Emergency Shock Trauma and Critical Care Surgery at the National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda.\"\n \nUpon receiving this letter, Melinda's mother was quite excited and looked forward to Thursday's Ball with pleasure.  Her daughter would be escorted by four handsome US Naval Officers without peer and all the other women in her social circle would be immensely impressed and insanely jealous.\n \nAt precisely 8:00 PM on Thursday, Melinda's mother heard a polite rap at the door which she opened to find, in full dress uniform, four very erect, very handsome, smiling ..... BLACK Naval Officers.\n \nHer jaw dropped and her mouth fell open, but after pulling herself together, she stammered, \"Ex, ex, excuse me. There, m,m,must be some kind of mistake.\"\n \n\"No, Madam,\" said one of the Officers confidently.\n \n\"Captain Goldstein NEVER makes mistakes.\"\n",

The fire hasn't yet reached the corporate office building in the center of the facility, and the chemical company's owner is desperate to keep the office building and all of the important secret chemical formulas in it from being destroyed. He gets on the Fire Department's radio frequency and announces he will give $250,000 to the engine company that can get the fire under control before it reaches the offices. The firemen redouble their efforts, and new trucks keep rolling in, but the fire gets hotter and more out of control as time passes. Soon the owner gets on the radio and ups the reward to $500,000. The firemen are pulling out all stops in battling the flames, but to know avail. At last, in desperation, the owner raises the reward to $1,000,000! Soon after his announcement, an old fire engine from a nearby rural volunteer fire department comes flying through the gates at full speed loaded with fat old firefighters. Without slowing, the engine races directly into the hellish fire straight towards the office. The old men bail out of the truck and begin frantically fighting the fire with a gusto the young city firefighters have never seen before. In a spectacular display, the old volunteers battle back the fire and soon have it under control. Later, as the oldsters are walking out from the battle while the younger firemen mop up, the chemical company owner comes over to their chief. \"Well, I've never seen anything like that in my life!\" He says. \"What are you boys gonna do with that $1,000,000 you just earned?\" \"Well,\" said the exhausted old chief, \"the first thing we're going to do is get the goddamn brakes fixed on that old truck!\"",

Everyone in the workplace knows that Skipper's always telling ridiculous stories and they eventually learn to ignore it. Skipper's boss, though, can't stand it, and says to himself \"this obnoxious kid is insufferable. I can't have him coming into the office everyday and spouting this bullshit, it's bad for productivity!\" So he resolves that the next time Skipper starts bragging, he'll call him on his lies and put him in his place.\n\nThe next morning, as expected, he hears Skipper walking around the office saying \"-no, really! I know EVERYONE in the world! Ask me about anybody, and they'll know who I am.\" People start gathering around Skipper, naming celebrities: \"Kanye West\" \"Jennifer Lawrence\" \"Brad Pitt\"  \"Yeah, guys,\" he answers, \"I know all of them.\"\n\nInterrupting, the boss walks in and says \"Oh, so you REALLY know Brad Pitt? I don't believe you.\" \"But I really do!\" Skipper answers. \"Then prove it to me!\" his boss replies.\n\nSkipper pulls out his phone and dials a number. Helistens for a couple seconds, then hangs up and says \"Well, I guess he's not home, darn.\" His boss chuckles to himself, saying \"Guess you don't know him after all! You better get back to work.\"\n\nSkipper then says \"How much do you want to bet? Since Brad and I are such good friends, he wouldn't mind me popping up at his house. Here's a bet: you buy plane tickets to LA for us. If you're right, and he doesn't know me, I'll pay you back double the price of the tickets.\"\n\nHis boss grins and says sure, and they head to the airport. On the flight, the boss asks Skipper, in a condescending tone, \"So, how do you know Brad Pitt?\" Skipper answers that they were actually college roommates. His boss rolls his eyes- there's no way this idiot was Brad Pitt's roommate!\n\nThey pull up to Brad Pitt's mansion and Skipper starts walking up to the lawn. \"Hey, Skipper,\" his boss interrupts, \"it's okay, you don't have to go on his lawn and get arrested or anything. Just pay me back for the tickets and we're all good.\" As he's speaking, though, Brad Pitt himself walks out in a robe and says \"Hey, Skipper, my man! What's up! I slept in this morning and missed your call. My butler was just making me some breakfast- how would you and your friend like to stay and eat with me?\"\n\nThey eat breakfast with Brad Pitt, and Skipper and he reminisce about their college antics. His boss, meanwhile, is steaming, and doesn't even enjoy the delicious breakfast.\n\nAs they leave, he says, \"That was just a fluke! You got lucky. How about we go double or nothing, on someone else.\" \"Sure,\" Skipper says, \"but you'll be disappointed- I really do know everyone there is to know.\" \"How about the president?\" his boss proposes?\n\nSkipper agrees. \"Oh yeah, Barry and I had 5th period Biology together in High School! Good times.\" So, they fly out to DC.\n\nWhen they get to the White House, Obama happens to be walking in the front door from his motorcade and spots Skipper across the lawn. \"Hey, Skipper!\" He shouts, \"come over here!\"\n\nSkipper and the president do some sort of secret handshake and immediately begin talking like old friends, to his boss's disbelief. \"I have a very busy schedule, as you might imagine, but I have a couple minutes right now if you wanted to grab coffee.\"\n\nAs Skipper and the president talk, Skipper's boss is even more upset. \"I should be enjoying this. I met Brad Pitt and Obama today! But I just can't believe Skipper though, he's got to just be crazy lucky for me to pick the two famous people he knows,\" he thinks to himself.\n\nSo, as they leave, the boss makes one last bet with Skipper: \"One more double or nothing. Anyone in the world, not just the country.\"\n\n\"I feel bad taking your money, boss! But, I'm having a great time today, so if you want to go see someone, I'll buy the tickets. And I ensure you, I'll know them.\" Skipper's boss cracks a smile and says \"okay, we're on our way to the Vatican. Let's see the Pope!\"\n\n\"Oh sure, I know him, boss!\" Skipper replies excitedly. \"I went to his church for a year before he became Pope.\"\n\nThey arrive at the Vatican just as the Pope is about to speak, and there's a massive crowd around the balcony. The Pope walks out and begins to address the crowd. The two Americans press as far as they can to the front of the crowd to get a good view, but they can only get about halfway in. Skipper tries to wave to him to get his attention, but there are far too many people.\n\n\"He'll never see me int he chaos here,\" Skipper remarks to his boss. \"You know what? Since I know all of the guards, I'll just head up past them and meet him up on the balcony. You stay here and watch me come out.\"\n\nSkipper runs into the building, saying hi to all of the guards on the way up. Once he's up there, he surprises the Pope. They have a nice conversation and Skipper waves to the crowd for a while with the Pope's hand on his shoulder before coming back down.\n\nAs he arrives back at where he and his boss were standing earlier, he sees an ambulance with a crowd of onlookers. To his surprise, his boss is on a stretcher in the back of the ambulance!\n\n\"Boss! Boss! Are you okay?\" \"Yeah, Skipper, I'm gonna be all right. I just fainted,\" his boss reassures him.\n\n\"Fainted? What happened?\"\n\n\"Well,\" the boss replies, \"I saw you come out onto the balcony and talk with the Pope. As you were waving to the crowd, another guy in the crowd turned to me and asked 'Hey, who's that-a guy on-a the balcony with-a Skipper?'\"",

Dave is sitting in his car, looking at the cop in his rear view mirror, now feeling very sober and crapping himself. The cop talks for another few minutes, glances at Daves car a few times with a quizzical look, and then starts the slow walk up to Daves window.\n\n\"Oh crap oh crap oh crap\" Daves thinkin. Here I go. Into the drunk tank. End of the licence. Maybe end of the job. Oh crap, and as the cop gets to Daves window he winds it down.\n\n\"Well sir,\" the cop says \"are you ok?\"\n\"Yes officer\" \n\"Well, if you're all right you can go on.

Sitting next to a lava pool were Ole and Sven, decked out in parkas, hats, boots and gloves.\n\nConfused, Satan walks up to them and asks them why they're dressed for winter in Hell.\n\nOle says, \"Vell yah know, ve're from Minnesota, a land of ice and snow and cold.  Ve're just happy to finally be varm for a change.\"\n\nSatan tries to reply, but can't think of anything, and so walks away scratching his head.  Finally he gets an idea.  So they want to be warm, do they?  He goes over to Hell's thermostat and turns the dial up a few notches.  \"That'll show those Minnesotans,\" Satan said with a smile.\n\nThe next day, hell was experiencing a heat wave, and the screams of the tormented were even louder.  Music to Satan's ears.  As he's wandering through on his daily round, he again comes upon Ole and Sven, who are now sitting with their gloves off and parkas unzipped.  Satan is flabbergasted, and asks them why they're still wearing their winter gear.\n\n\"Vell,\" Sven says, \"ve're still a bit chilly, but dis here heat vave is nice, yah know.  Gonna be a good summer in Hell dis year, yah?\"\n\nSatan throws up his hands and leaves.  I'll show 'em this time, he thinks.  He heads back to Hell's thermostat, and rips the cover off of it.  After tweaking a couple wires, he cranks the dial as high as it'll go.  \"That'll fix 'em\", he said confidently.\n\nThe next day, Hell is blazing.  Even Satan himself is sweating waterfalls as he seeks out Ole and Sven to witness their suffering.  He finally finds them and is shocked by what he sees.  Next to a lava pool, Ole and Sven are wearing jeans and t-shirts, standing next to an open grill and laughing as they drink beers.  \n\n\"What the hell are you doing??!\" Satan cries as he walks up to them.\n\nOle notices him and says, \"Vell, ven da veather gets varn like dis, you gotta have a fish fry.  Can't let nice days like dis go to vaste, don'cha know.\"\n\n\"Gahh!\" Satan screams as he pulls on his horns and storms away.  There's gotta be a way to get them, he thinks, but what?  Then he remembers what Ole said about where they were from.  Maybe I've been approaching their torment wrong, Satan thinks with a smile.  He goes back to Hell's thermostat, and this time, cranks the dial as low as it'll go.  I've got them this time, Satan thinks.\n\nThe next day, Hell is coated in ice.  The lava pools have frozen over, gigantic icicles hang from the ceiling, and the tormented souls are shivering too much to cry in pain.  Even the demons are visibly uncomfortable.\n\nSatan skips with glee through Hell, intent on finding the Minnesotans and finally seeing them suffer.  He finally finds them, and just stops.  Before him, Ole and Sven are back in their winter gear, but they're dancing around and cheering.\n\nSatan finally snaps.  \"First you love the heat, and now you love the cold?\" he said.  \"What is wrong with you Minnesotans??\"\n\nSven stops cheering long enough to say, \"Don'cha know?  Hell froze over!  Dat means da Vikings von da Superbowl!\"",

But I have a solution to the problem if young sir would permit.\" The husband being very concerned agreed that the doctor could use whatever method to get the bee out of his wife's vagina. The doctor said \"OK, what I'm gonna do is rub some honey over the top of my penis and insert it into your wife's vagina. When I feel the bee getting closer to the tip of my penis I shall withdraw it and the bee should hopefully follow my penis out of your wife's vagina. The husband nodded and gave his approval. The young lady said \"Yes, Yes, whatever, just get on with it.\"\n\n\nSo the doctor, after covering the tip of his penis with honey, inserted it into the young lady's vagina. After a few gentle strokes, the doctor said, \"I don't think the bee has noticed the honey yet. Perhaps I should go a bit deeper.\" So the doctor went deeper and deeper. After a while the doctor began shafting the young lady very hard indeed.\n\n\nThe young lady began to quiver with excitement. She began to moan and groan aloud.\n\n\nThe doctor, concentrating very hard, looked like he was enjoying himself, he then put his hands on the young lady's breasts and started making loud noises.\n\n\nThe husband at this point suddenly became very annoyed and shouted, \"Now wait a minute!

So one day the older brother's boss told him that he had to go on an assignment to the capital city for the weekend. The older brother would have to give a presentation to some very important people in the company and if he went and did well, he would get a promotion, but if he didn't go, he would be fired.\n\nNow, the thing is, both of the brothers had spent their whole life in the village. They had never even been to the capital, but what choice did the brother have? He had to go or else he would be fired.\n\nSo anyway, on the Friday before he had to leave, he taught the younger brother how to look after the cat. He prepared a whole timetable for him!\nOn the next day, the brother left the house. He had a nice train journey to the capital and he enjoyed it very much. When he got to the hotel he decided to call his younger brother to check up on the cat. So this is how the conversation went:\n\n>   **Younger brother**: \"Hello?\"\n>  \n>  **Older brother**: \"Hey, how are you? How's my cat doing?\"\n>  \n>  **Younger brother**: \"Oh it died.\"\n>  \n>  The older brother was devastated, especially because of the way that the younger brother delivered the bad news to him.\n>  \n>  **Older brother**: \"That's not the proper way to deliver bad news to someone!\"\n>  \n>  **Younger brother**: \"Oh. What should I have done?\"\n>  \n>  **Older brother**: \"Well, for starters you have to drag it out. For example I'd call you today and you'd say: \"the cat is on the roof, I'm trying to get it down now.\" Maybe half an hour later I'd call you again and you would say: \"I couldn't get him down, so I called the fire brigade to come help.\" I might wait an hour and call you again and you would say: \"Oh yes, they are here and are climbing the roof right now.\" Then you'd call be back and say: \"The cat fell off and I'm driving him to the vet right now.\" Then maybe the next morning I would call back to ask and you would tell me that my cat couldn't make it through the night. Understand?\"\n>  \n>  **Younger brother**: \"Yes, you're right, I'm sorry.\"\n>  \n>  **Older brother**: \"So anyways, how's mum doing?\"\n> \n> **Younger brother**: \"She's on the roof, I'm trying to get her down\"\n\n\n*Source: My chemistry teacher.*",

Stuffed, the man is lead to a room where he is to stay for the night before departing. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange scream behind a door in the monastery. Although it was brief and faint, he can not stop thinking about the noise, and is unable to sleep that night.\nThe next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.\nThe man attempts to forget about the sound, but every time he thought about it, it came back to haunt him.\nYears later, the man went back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.\nThe monks reply, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\"\nThe man says, \"If the only way I can find out what is making that sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.\"\nThe monks reply, \"You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.\"\nThe man sets about his task. \n\nAfter years of searching and traveling to monasteries throughout the world, he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.\n\"In my quest to find what makes that sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.\"\nThe monks reply, \"Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.\"\nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \"The sound is beyond that door.\"\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.\n\"In order to get past this door, you must travel to a monastery on foot 10 miles South East of our current location, and retrieve the ancient stone key\" the Monk informs him.\nSo the man hikes 10 miles South east, informs the other monks of his cause, and is rewarded the key.\nHe returns and opens the stone door\u2026 to find a door made of ruby.\n\"In order to go past this door, you must retrieve the ruby of the ancients, found in a monastery in the nearby mountains, about 130 miles North, on foot.\"\nSo the man packs up, and once again on foot, spends 2 weeks traveling 130 miles to the monastery and back.\nHe opens the ruby door, only to find a door made of solid gold. The monks say, \"Only one person at a time may enter through this door. This door requires no key.\" The monk exits the hallway, and closes the doors behind him.\nAs the man touches the door, the noise that had been haunting him was heard again. The scream, once faint, now distinct.\nWith trembling hands, he turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. He falls to his knees upon seeing the source of the sound...\n\n\n\nBut, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",

        "body": "This will be entirely from the point of view of Mr. Locke; it is not actually me who said this, even though I use the word \"I.\"\n\n\nI was just opening the envelope I had received from one of my colleagues.  I read the short card inside that said \"please come to my house from a christmas eve party at 9:00.\" I went over my schedule in my head to make sure it was free, and sure enough, it was.\n\nChristmas eve rolls around and I arrive at the party. I see a lot of other teachers there, from every subject, even those stupid history teachers.\n\nIt was a good party; everyone was dancing, eating, drinking, having lots of fun.  But there was one catch: The dog.\n\nI hated dogs.\n\nI tried to have as much fun as I could, and it was fun socializing when the dog was around.  But when he was, I was just instantly put into a bad mood.  It smelled bad, licked me, all this stuff that I hated.\n\nSo the party was starting to come to an end and people were starting to leave; it was late.  I began to wind down and started to get ready to leave.  I went to say goodbye to my fellow teacher who was hosting the party.\n\nMe: \"Hey, thanks so much for having everyone over! This was a lot of fun!\"\n\nTeacher: \"Oh yeah, no problem at all.  I'm glad you had a good time.  And you can see yourself out, but make sure the dog doesn't get out.\"\n\nMe: \"Sure thing.  See you next Monday.\"\n\nI began to make my way to the door, and the dog realized that I was getting ready to leave.  He started to follow me, and I thought I wasn't even going to have to worry about accidentally letting the dog out.\n\nI made it to the door, and sure enough, the dog is following me.  I slowly opened the door, doing that awkward thing where you push your whole body tightly against the small opening and try to squeeze out.\n\nYet, sure enough, the dog slipped through my legs.  As it was going through my legs, I tried to shut the door, in an attempt to keep it from escaping.  It got out... mostly.\n\nBecause of my hatred for dogs, I was already a little bit P.O.'ed from the dog being all up in my air, so I closed the door a little bit more aggressively than necessary... right on the dogs tail. The door shut, and the dog was attached to the door via tail.\n\nI was completely astounded at what I had done, and had no idea what to do.  The tail stopped moving, and there was clearly something wrong with it - it might have been broken.\n\nI decided to just load the dog into my SUV and find a vet, without the dog's owner knowing (I felt very horrible).\n\nI drove for 3 hours trying to find a vet, but could not find a vet that dealt with tails.  No matter where I drove, I could not find one.\n\nSuddenly, a light at the end of the tunnel appeared.  It was Walmart, the #1 re-tail-er in the country!",

        "body": "Billy was obsessed with tractors. He grew up on a farm and ever since the very first moment he laid eyes on a tractor he thought they were the most beautiful things he'd ever seen. His parents would take him for rides through the fields on their tractor and started buying him toy tractors to play with. As he grew up he drew pictures of tractors all the time, and collected photos of rare tractors to put up in his bedroom. He bought tractor magazines and joined the Tractor Fanclub, and spent any spare pocket money on building model tractors. He was the biggest fan of tractors the world had ever seen.\n\nHis parents worried a little as his obsession grew, but it didn't seem to be harming anyone so they let it run its course. \"He'll grow out of it in a year or two\" they told each other. But he didn't, and soon he had started school. \n\nBilly was a gifted kid, but it soon became obvious that his obsession with tractors was making it hard for him to make friends. The few kids that tried to hang out with him got bored of talking about tractors and it seemed like Billy talked of little else. Billy grew lonely and started to realise that his love of tractors might be better hidden from the world.\n\nSo when Billy started High School he thought of it as a fresh new start. He tried his best to keep his tractor love hidden from his school mates and only indulged in his obsessive tractor fandom at home or reading tractor magazines in the school toilets. He got great marks and seemed especially gifted at mechanical subjects and agriculture, his knowledge of tractors and how they worked held him in good stead. In fact Billy became quite popular, and made a lot of good friends, and he hardly talked about tractors with them at all. \n\nAt the beginning of 10th grade Billy fell in love with a girl called Monica. Monica had beautiful dark brown hair and round braces that almost looked like little tractor wheels. Billy and Monica started holding hands and school, and then kissing occasionally between classes, and eventually Billy asked her to come over to his parents farm and meet his family. \n\nSo Monica came round one afternoon after school and met Billy's lovely parents and had a lot of fun roaming around the farm. Billy could not have been happier and all was going well unitl Monica asked Billy to see his room. \"I don't think that's a good idea\" said Billy, but Monica only laughed and would not be swayed, and playfully she ran past Billy up the hall to his bedroom door and opened it.\n\nAs the door creaked open Monica let out a horrible scream and after recoiling for a moment ran out of the house and all the way home. Inside the room was a vision of a madman. Tractors EVERYWHERE! From posters of tractors on every piece of wall to tractor quilts to thousands of model tractors on every available surface, the room was too much for Monica to deal with. She was absolutely freaked out.\n\nBilly was distraught. He cried and cried and cursed his love of tractors. He flew into a rage, realising that his obsession with tractors had to stop. He pulled down the tractor posters, and broke apart his tractor shaped bed. He piled them outside with his tractor toys and models, his tractor magazines and books, his Tractor Fanclub membership card and his used tractor parts. He flew around the room gathering up every last tractor related item until the room was nearly bare and then when it was all on the huge pile outside he lit it all on fire. His parents came out and put a hand on his shoulder as he watched it burn, they knew it was good for him.\n\nBilly went back to school, and although Monica would not talk to him, he was able to move on with his life. He soon graduated and went to college, deciding to study Finance, about as un-tractor like a subject as possible. Still sometimes he daydreamed and had to force himself not to draw tractors absentmindedly in the margins of his books. \n\nIt worked. By his second year of college Billy was entirely normal, and had even met a wonderful girl called Chloe. He had met Chloe through his new best friend Steve who was training to be a chef, and soon Billy and Chloe were dating. \n\nBilly and Chloe would go on double dates with Steve and his girlfriend Alison, and eventually started going travelling too. They were very much in love. In fact they were so in love that 6 months later, after returning from a trip to Japan, Billy proposed to Chloe at the new restaurant Steve had just opened. And like that they were engaged to be married.\n\nChloe came from a wealthy family, and as soon as her parents heard the news they insisted on a huge white wedding. They hired a beautiful white painted hall, and Chloe's mum became involved in picking every single thing for the wedding, from white tablecloths to a huge, towering white cake. And of course, most important, a beautiful flowing white wedding dress. \n\nBilly's parents were a little overwhelmed by the excess, being used to their humble farm. But Billy was a wonderful son and kept them looked after during the long preparations and rehearsals. Steve's restaurant was being very successful so Billy got him to cater the wedding feast and before anyone knew it the day of the wedding was upon them. \n\nThere was a huge hustle and bustle of frantic activity on the morning of the special day, and all seemed to be going perfectly. Unfortunately, Steve's girlfriend Alison had chosen that morning to break up with him, and he was distraught. And yet he knew he must pull it together if he was to cook the feast for his best friend's wedding. But he was in such a bad way that he started drinking from the cooking sherry and had soon drunk enough that he passed out in the kitchen. But the stovetop had been left on and soon all the food was burning, and a fire started blazing. \n\nIt was only an hour out from the wedding and everyone was so busy with their wedding tasks that it took them some minutes to notice. But with a shout from a groomsman everyone saw the fire and rushed to save Steve from inside the kitchen. Smoke and ash billowed out through the door and into the hall. Billy and his friends quickly managed to put out the fire but when the danger was gone Billy walked out into a hall that had become a disaster zone. Soot covered all the beautiful white tablecloths, and the hall was full of smoke. Chloe's mum was in hysterics, screaming that the wedding was ruined and Chloe herself, the beautiful bride, was crying uncontrollably in a beautiful white wedding dress covered in ash. Billy looked around the hall and knew he had to do something.\n\n\"I can fix this!\" he yelled. Everyone stopped their shouting and watched as Billy, the soon to be groom, strode over and opened the biggest window. 'There's only one thing for it' he thought to himself.\n\nHe opened his mouth as wide as it could go and started sucking up all the smoke. Wooosh, it was sucked into his lungs, and he went to the window and blew it all back out into the world. Again and again, Wooooosh, Billy sucked up all the smoke and the soot from the perfectly white tablecloths. Woooosh, he sucked up the ash from on the cake and all the smoke left in the hall and blew it out into the air out the window. Finally, as the rest of the wedding party looked on incredulously, mouths agape, he went over to his Chloe and wooooosh sucked up all the ash from her wedding dress. \n\nAfter one final trip to the window to blow the last smoke and soot out into the outside air Billy turned to see the hall sparkling and white. The wedding was saved! But the wedding party were astonished. Chloe's mum was looking faint and his parents were astounded by their son. But Billy only had eyes for his future wife and he walked over to where she was standing with a very confused look on her face.\n\n\"Billy, how the hell did you do that?\" she asked, shocked.\n\nBilly got down on one knee, and looking up as his love he said \"Chloe, there's something about me you should know. I'm an extractor fan.\"",

After about a month or two he gets the courage but when he asks Janet to dinner, she says sorry I only date frosted cheerios. He becomes depressed and decides to put all his effort into work. One day his boss calls him into his office and says \u201cTom, congrats you got a promotion!\u201d Tom then has an idea and asks his boss that instead of taking a promotion, can the boss pay for Tom to get frosted, after some thinking and allocating finances, the boss says fine, but we can only half frost you at this time. Tom says fine and goes and gets the procedure done. He goes up to Janet the next day and asks her on a date, she immediately replies, no Tom I only date fully frosted cheerios. Tom then works harder than ever before to get his new promotion so he can get fully frosted. Finally that day comes, he passes the promotion, gets the procedure done and cannot wait until the next day to ask Janet out. The next day he asks Janet to the company banquet that night and after seeing the new Tom she is impressed and says \u201cof course.\u201d At the banquet that night, being polite, he asks Janet if he could get her anything to drink, she says \u201cUm, yah if you could get me some milk that would be amazing.\u201d So Tom goes and waits in the line for milk for almost a half hour and when he finally gets to the front, they\u2019re all out of milk. He shamefully walks back to Janet and says \u201cthey ran out of milk can I get you anything else?\u201d She says sure, why don\u2019t you go over to the keg and get us some beer. Seeing where this was going Tom goes over to the keg, but this time the line is twice as long. Knowing he can\u2019t go back empty handed again, he waits on the line but when it gets to be his turn, the keg is tapped. He goes back empty handed again to Janet; he says \u201cI\u2019m so sorry but they\u2019re out of beer too.\u201d She then replies \u201cit\u2019s fine I guess, then can you just get me some punch.\u201d He says sure and walks around the entire place looking for the punch, and he can\u2019t find it anywhere, just then he sees Janet walking out of the banquet with another frosted cheerio and he realizes there was no punch line.",

Otetiani, a boy whale, and Orenda, a girl whale.\n\nAs they swam along they saw in the distance a whaling ship. Upon seeing the ship Orenda became very nervous knowing that the ship meant death for her and Otetiani if they did not sound (dive deep) and swim away as fast as they could. Orenda spoke to Otetiani, \"Otetiani! We must leave here, sound deep and swim away, lest these men come and take our lives for oil!.\" \n\nTo relieve Orenda's fears Otetiani began to speak, explaining a strategy he had come up with to deal with the whale boats. It would allow the whales to again be the masters of the sea. \"Our size and mobility are our greatest assets.\" Otetiani said. \"We can take great breaths, then exhale as we swim underneath the whaleboats. It will cause a great turbulence in the water, sinking the whaleboats and leaving the hunters individually adrift in the sea; they will no longer be a threat.\"\n\nOrenda, being a clever whale herself realized that this was no more than an adaptation of their \"bubble net\" feeding strategies. \"Otetiani, surely you are wise, and with our combined efforts we shall surely prevail.\" so they agreed to defend themselves from the whalers in this fashion. Taking great lungfuls of air they stealthily swam underneath the whaleboats and began to exhale.\n\nThe whalers were confounded as the boats sank swiftly into the roiling sea. Giddy with the success of the strategy Otetiani spoke to Orenda saying, \"Orenda! Quickly! Let us now devour the hunters as they founder in the sea. They are helpless and we can destroy them so they can never hunt our kind again!\"\n\nDistressed with the change in Otetiani's plan Orenda quickly replied, \"Otetiani this is not how we should behave! I agreed to the blowjob but I am not swallowing seamen!\"",

He knows that there are four different types of elephants in his area: red elephants, blue elephants, purple elephants, and white elephants.  \n\nTo kill a blue elephant you use a blue elephant gun, to kill a red elephant you use a red elephant gun, and to kill a purple elephant you use a purple elephant gun.  However scientists have so far been able to create a white elephant gun.  So what could the farmer do?\n\nWell the farmer had been working his land for 50 years, so he knew some tricks.  One thing was that white elephants love cherry cheesecake. \n\nSo one morning the farmer goes out to the patch of ground where the white elephant was before and set out a cherry cheesecake with ten cherries arranged in a circle, and then retreated to his house to watch.  The white elephant soon came across the offering and was overjoyed; it happily gobbled it up because white elephants love cherry cheesecake.\n\nThe next morning the farmer left out a cheesecake, but this time it only had nine cherries on top, this time in a star pattern.  When the white elephant found the cherry cheesecake it was delighted, and quickly ate it without noticing that there was one less cherry (white elephants can't count well past 5) because white elephants love cherry cheesecake.\n\nThe next morning the farmer left out a cheesecake with seven cherries on it, in the shape of a light bulb.  The white elephant subconsciously senses that there is less of a cherry flavor, but it doesn\u2019t really notice because it's very lucky for there to be a cheesecake in the same spot three days in a row.  It eats the cheesecake because white elephants love cherry cheesecake.\n\nThe next morning the farmer sets out a cheesecake with six cherries in a semi circle.  The white elephant is beginning to think that something is wrong, because it definitely seems like there is something off about it.  The elephant eats it anyway because white elephants love cherry cheesecake.\n\nThe next day the farmer put out a cheesecake with five cherries on it in a pentagon.  The white elephant knows for sure that something is wrong because it can count to 5, and there used to be more than that.  It grunts and waves its trunk around a little, but still eats it because white elephants love cherry cheesecake.\n\nThe next morning the farmer set out a cheesecake with just four cherries arranged in a square.  The elephant is beginning to get upset about its dwindling cherries, but it eats it anyway because white elephants love cherry cheesecake.  \n\nThe next morning the farmer left out a cheesecake with only three cherries arranged in a triangle.  The elephant has now grown furious, so it storms out away from the farmer's field into his neighbor's, which the elephant proceeds to trample and destroy.  Then, having cooled down a little it returns and eats the cheesecake, because white elephants love cherry cheesecake.\n  \nThe next morning the farmer put out a cheesecake with two cherries.  The elephant is again so furious that it angrily runs off and destroys the neighbor's house and crushes his car.  Then it comes back because white elephants love cherry cheesecake. \n\nThe next morning the farmer sets out a cheesecake with only one cherry, stuck right in the center.  The elephant is in full rage mode, and it goes to the neighbor's house.  Since his house was destroyed the neighbor was living in a tent.  The elephant trampled the tent and crushed him to death.  Then it came ad begrudgingly ate the cheesecake because white elephants love cherry cheesecake.\n\nOn the final day the farmer changes things up a little.  Instead of cherries, he covers it in slices of pears.  When the white elephant saw this it couldn\u2019t believe its eyes.  White elephants HATE pears!  They despise pears!  And there was no cherry cheesecake!  The white elephant was just so angry, just so full of rage that it couldn\u2019t even move.  It just stood there and turned purple with rage and the farmer shot it with the purple elephant gun.\n\nEDIT:  Removed TL;DR\n",

Grumbling, he walks out, deep into the weeds and stumbles across a sleeping leprechaun. He nudges the leprechaun and it says to him \"Ah crap, I thought this was far enough off the course that nobody would come out here. Well, rules are rules: you found me and I will grant you one wish.\"\n\nThe man replies \"I'd like to be the greatest amateur golfer in the world.\"\n\nThe leprechaun replies \"All right, I can do that for you, but there's a catch: your sex life is going to go downhill quite a bit.\" The man agrees and the leprechaun grants his wish and vanishes in a cloud of green smoke.\n\nThe man pulls out his 4 iron and lines up the next shot. He swings and when the golf ball lands, he is astonished to see it has landed on the green only a couple yards from the hole. He sinks it in a single shot with his putter and ends up making par. On the seventh hole, he swings his driver and the golf ball goes straight down the middle of the fairway, landing directly on the green again. With mounting excitement, the golfer finishes the round of golf with pars and birdies, and even makes two double birdies, finishing well below par. After another couple of weekends of amazing golf, he decides to enter an amateur tournament at his local club, winning by three strokes against the runner-up. Emboldened, he starts entering competitions at other courses further away, and within a couple of months, he has become the best amateur golfer in the world.\n\nAbout a year later, he returns to the public course and approaches the sixth hole. He swings and slices the ball hard to the right. \"Huh, I haven't done that in quite a while,\" he remarks to himself. Once again, he finds his ball far off in the weeds, right next to the leprechaun. The leprechaun greets him and asks him how he has been. The golfer says \"Thanks, my life has been wonderful. I'm the greatest amateur golfer in the world.\" \n\n\"Well, how about your sex life?\" asks the leprechaun.\n\n\"Oh, just great. I really can't complain.\"\n\nPuzzled, the leprechaun asks \"How many times have you had sex in the last year?\"\n\nThe golfer says \"Well, maybe three times?\"\n\nThe leprechaun laughs and says \"You've had sex three times in the last year and still think your sex life is great?\"\n\n\"Well, for a priest in a small town in Ireland, I think I'm doing pretty well.\"",

Next, my mind instantly began racing to decipher the inquiry, \"..uhh.....rape?.....roofies?!....please, God, don't let me be raped upon the self check out counter attempting to purchase a box of Twinkies and some bananas...\", but instead, all I managed to do was shrug in a confused manner and sheepishly respond with, \"uhh...

Once I had a chance to pause and collect myself in the parking lot next to my car, I breathed a sigh of relief. At that same moment I replayed the events that unfolded only moments ago and then smirked to myself as I finally got the joke.\n\nFeeling a bit embarrassed, but also relieved to be safe and warm in my car with my Twinkies in hand, I shrugged and drove off into the twilight.\n\nTL/DR: A bearded-ninja busted a surprise joke on me in line at the grocery store.

One day the priest put out a bunch of flyers about how he was looking for an assistant and anyone whk was interested should come to the church.\n\nAfter two weeks of no responses, the priest was hopeless until he heard a knock on the church door. He opened the door to see a man with no arms standing there.\n\n\"Hello my son, what is your cause of being here?\" He questioned the man.\n\n\"I am here for the bell-ringer position. Is it still open?\" The man replied.\n\n\"Well yes, it is, but how could a man like you ring a bell?\" The priest asked.\n\n\"Trust me, father, I will be able to ring that bell. I promise.\" The man responded.\n\nThe priest, not wanting to turn away a man for his disability decided to let the man try. If he could ring the bell at noon that day, he would get the job. The man, excitedly ran up the stairs and the priest waited for noon to come.\n\nAt noon, on the dot, the bell rang as loud as ever. The priest was shocked and for the first time in years he ran up the stairs to the bell. When he got to the top, he was panting, and began to speak to the man.\n\n\"My son! How on Earth were you able to ring that bell?\" The priest said in between breaths.\n\n\"Father, you might think I kicked the bell but then I would lose my balance and fall. Instead, I bang my head as hard as I can against it.\" The man said with a smirk on his face.\n\nThe Priest was shocked to hear this, \"My son! Doesn't that hurt you?\" The Priest asked.\n\n\"No father, if it did, I would not have applied for this job.\"\n\nThe Priest took the man's word and decided to let him keep the job. From that day on, the bell rang beautifully, at noon exactly every time. About two weeks later, the bell didn't ring. The man had fallen from the tower to the street below!\n\nThe police arrived at the seen and began questioning individuals.

Especially for a dream vacation. I can help you out with some smaller loans such as our $10,000 small businesses loan with 6.99% APR which will result in 120 monthly payments of about $116.06 or even our $15,000 loan with APR as low as 7.897% depending on your credit rating.\". \"That simply won't do\", said the frog, \"I need $30,000. If it's a matter of credit score I have a flawless credit rating. Also, if I need a co-signer my father said he would. His name is Mick Jagger.\".  \"Mick Jagger?!?\" replied Patty, \"The lead singer of the Rolling Stones?\" The frog said, \"Yes that Mick Jagger. I am his adopted son and he said he would happily co-sign.\" Miss Whack was still a little skeptical about giving a loan of such magnitude. Her very job and welfare would be in jeopardy if this frog wouldn't be able to make the required payments for this massive vacation loan. She finally says, \"If I were to allow such a loan I would need to have some sort of collateral.\". The frog said \"No problem\" and pulled out of his pocket a very small porcelain elephant. It was pink, made of glass and very well defined. It was a beautiful glass porcelain elephant. \"What is that?\" asked Patty. The frog explained that it's a very old glass elephant passed down from his birth family for generations. \"It started as my great great great grandfathers and was passed down all the way down through generations until my father gave it to me on his death bed.\" He said as he handed Miss Whack the elephant. \"It's extremely old, delicate and EXTREMELY valuable.\". The bank teller examined this tiny glass elephant for a few moments. She was still very hesitant to hand out this loan. \"I'm sorry sir but I don't know if I can accept this as collateral. I'm never even sure what this is. \" The frog is starting to get upset and frustrated with Patricia Whack. He says, \"Look, just go talk to your manager and see what he says. Please I really need this loan.\". Miss Whack agrees and walks in the back to find the manager taking the tiny porcelain elephant with her. She finds her way to the back of the bank and finds the manager in his office. \"What seems to be the problem Patty?\" Asked the manager. \"Well,\" replied Miss Whack, \" There's a frog out there trying to apply for a $30,000 bank loan to go on his dream vacation. He claims to be Mick Jaggers adopted son. And for collateral all he gave me was this tiny elephant. I don't even know what this is.\". She hands the manager the tiny porcelain elephant. He holds it up close to his eye and examines it for a couple of minutes. Finally he looks up to Patty and sings, \"It's a knick knack Patty Whack give the frog a loan. His old mans a Rolling Stone\" lol",

But to the mans dismay, the spit dries up and she is bone dry again.\n\n\"Excuse me ma'am, I don't mean to be rude but you're still dry, are you sure there is nothing I can do?\"\n\nThe lady tries one more thing, and they give it another shot.  The man is bewildered.  Something she did turned that dried up desert into oasis.  He eased himself in with no issue and for the first time in years he finally felt the love of a woman.  After the sex, the man was still confused.\n\n\"Ma'am, what an amazing trick! How did get yourself to wet so fast?\"\n\n\"Oh, well I just reached up inside, pulled the scab, and let the pus run.\"",

While the wizard would like to have his beloved witch clean up after him, her stubbornness and aforementioned irritability means that he usually ends up with the broom.\n\nOne night, however, the witch messed up. She had been careless, and an unattended and particularly pernicious potion's odors had left green stains on the once-clean walls of her wizard's hut. Immediately when the wizard came home, he ordered her to scrub the stains off.\n\n\"Shan't,\" replied the witch.\n\n\"Baby,\" said the wizard, \"I love you, but I swear, if you don't clean those walls I'll turn you into a frog.\"\n\n\"Pfft. You wouldn't, you're just a big softie,\" replied the witch. But the wizard was so incensed that, true to his word, he turned her into a frog with a wave of his wand.\n\n\"I'll only change you back if you work,\" said the wizard.\n\n\"Shan't!\" replied the obstinate witch.\n\n\"Well,\" said the wizard, \"if you don't scrub the walls, well...baby, I love you, but if you don't scrub the walls, I'll turn you into something even worse. A dung beetle!\" \n\n\"Shan't!\" the witch repeated, and before she could hop off she was transformed into a dung beetle by another wave of the wizard's wand.\n\n\"You'll never get me to work,\" the witch said, \"you're such a big softie, I know you.\"\n\nNow the wizard was more angry than he had even been before, and he couldn't control himself, \"Alright, baby, I seriously love you, but if you don't get to work right now I will transform you into fire, and you'll burn and burn and all you'll feel is pain!\"\n\n\"Pfft, you'd never, you big fat softie-\" but before the witch could finish, the wizard had waved his wand again, and she had transformed into a blazing ball. Soon she was feeling the heat.\n\n\"ARRRRGGGHHH!!\" she screamed, \"CHANGE ME BACK!

CALVIN JONES- OPTICAL EXAMINATIONS. He was intrigued and examined the tinted windows near the door. \"WE'RE HIRING\", one said. Excited by the prospect of a job, he opened the door and went inside.\n\nThere wasn't much to see. As far as he could tell, it was just an empty lobby, without even a receptionist to greet him. Assuming they were closed and simply forgot to lock up, he was about to walk out when he heard a voice through an intercom near the door.\n\n\"Hey! Is somebody there!?\" The voice shouted angrily.\n\n\"Err...yes, I was wondering if you had any job openings available....where are you? Is this place closed or something? I can't see anybody here.\"\n\n\"Of course you can't! Get out right this minute!\"\n\n\"What?! I was just wondering if you were hiring, is all!\"\n\n\"And *why* would you think that?\"\n\n\"I saw the sign out front....\"\n\nThe voice paused for a moment. \"Alright, then. Go down the hallway to your right and up the stairs. You're hired.\"\n\n\"But...!\"\n\nThe man was about to protest that he hadn't even been interviewed, but the intercom cut out and he heard nothing but static, so he did as the voice said and proceeded down the hallway and up to the second floor of the building. It was very cramped, and had little rooms along the corridors, the kind you might see in a doctor's office. But it wasn't lit up like the lobby; the lights appeared to be turned off and he couldn't see a foot in front of him.\n\nHe grappled for a light switch and flicked it. At once the hallway was bright, and now he could see another man with a cane and dark glasses closing the door of one of the rooms, saying the words \"I don't see anything wrong.\" To a client, the man presumed. Then the second man turned around and began walking towards him, painfully slowly, while the second man made a note that he had a nametag embroidered on his coat, reading *Dr. Jones*. He must run this place, thought the man. Though he wanted to consult him about the job, the doctor looked busy, so he decided to waste some time looking at a painting of an iris flower on the wall.\n\nUnexpectedly, they collided when the doctor hit the man with his cane.\n\n\"Ow! What the fuck was that for?!\"\n\nThe doctor was equally surprised. \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hit you! I didn't realise...I'm so sorry!\"\n\n\"Well watch where you're going next time, okay? My fucking shin hurts now, and all I wanted was a job...\"\n\n\"No need to explain yourself, because you'll be leaving this building shortly. If you didn't know, you aren't supposed to be up here.\"\n\n\"But the intercom told me to come here...\"\n\n\"Ah. One of my interns, up to their old tricks again. Well, I'm terribly sorry, but you're going to have to leave anyway.\"\n\n\"But they hired me!\"\n\nThe doctor was silent for a moment. \"Hired you? Why would they do that?\"\n\n\"I don't know! I told them I saw the sign on the door and they let me in!\"",

In order to present the widest possible knowledge base for polite conversation, I am sending three of my best and most prized officers.\n\nOne is a lieutenant commander, and a graduate of Annapolis with an additional Masters degree from MIT in fluid technologies and ship design.\n\nThe second is a Lieutenant, one of our helicopter pilots, and a graduate of Northwestern university in Chicago, with a BS in Aeronautical Engineering.

In Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering are from Texas Tech University and he is also an astronaut candidate.\n\nFinally, the third officer, also a lieutenant commander, is our ship's doctor, with an undergraduate degree from the University of Georgia and his medical degree is from the University of North Carolina . We are very proud of him, as he is also a senior fellow in Trauma Surgery at Bethesda .'\n\nUpon receiving this letter, the mother was quite excited and looked forward to Thursday with pleasure. Her daughter would be escorted by three handsome naval officers (and the other women in her social circle would be insanely jealous).\n\nAt precisely 8:00 PM on Thursday, Melinda's mother heard a polite rap at the door which she opened to find, in full dress uniform, three very handsome, smiling black officers.\n\nHer mouth fell open, but pulling herself together, she stammered, 'There must be some mistake.'\n\n'No, Madam,' said the first officer, 'Captain Goldberg never makes mistakes.'",

He goes to the first mans room opens the door and sees the man sitting on the floor exhausted with babies everywhere and the women yelling at him. He smiles and continues to the second mans room, he opens the door and sees  a bulbous man laying on the floor still stuffing his face with feces everywhere. He chuckles a bit and heads to the third mans room, he walks over opens the door and as soon he does he hears the man cry out \"Hey man! You got a lighter?\".",

She wants to have many more children with me and that's now one of my dreams too. \n\nMariel taught me that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone and we'll be growing it for us and trading it with her friends for all the \ncocaine and ecstasy we want. In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so Mariel can get better; she sure deserves it!! \n\nDon't worry Dad, I'm 15 years old now and I know how to take care of myself. Someday I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your grandchildren. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------\nYour son, \nTom \n\nPS: Dad, none of the above is true.

I need SOMETING!\"\n\n\"well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'VooDoo Dick.'\" The old man reached under the counter, pulled out an old wooden box with strange symbols, and opened it. There lay a very ordinary-looking Dildo.\n\nThe businessman laughed, and commented that it looked like every other dildo in this shop.\n\n\"But You haven't seen what it'll do,\" said the proprietor. He pointed to a door and said, \"VooDoo Dick, the door.\" The VooDoo Dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook, then started to split down the middle, at which point the old man commanded, \"VooDoo Dick, back in your box!\"\n\nThe VooDoo Dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, quiescent once more.\n\n\"I'll take it!\" said the businessman.\n\nThe old man said it wasn't for sale, but finally surrendered it for seven hundred dollars, in cash. Pleased as punch, the businessman gave his wife the gift, explained that all she had to do was say \"VooDoo Dick, my pussy\" is she got lonely, and set off on his business trip.\n\nAfter a few days, the wife grew unbearably horny. Feeling a little foolish, she opend the box and said tentatively, \"VooDoo Dick, my pussy!\" The VooDoo Dick shot out of the box, made a beeline for her crotch, and started pumping away. It was fabulous, like nothing she'd ever experienced before, and she lay back and enjoyed the rush of pleasure. after three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough and reached to pull out the dildo. It wouldn't budge. Nothing worked. The VooDoo dick was stuck, thrusting away. Her husband had forgotten to tell her how to turn it off.\n\nDesperate, she pulled on a skirt, got in the car, and headed for the hospital, nearly fainting with excitement and exhaustion. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swear off the road, and to her horror, a squad car pulled her over. First the policeman asked her for her licence. Then, observing her disheveled state, he asked how much she'd had to drink.\n\nTwitching and sweating, she gasped, \" I haven't been drinking, officer. A VooDoo Dick is stuck in my pussy, and it wont stop screwing!\"\n\n\"Sure lady,\" said the officer after another long look at her. \"VooDOO Dick, My ass!\"\n\n\nI hope you enjoy =) This is not my own joke, it comes the \"The Friars Club Encyclopedia of Jokes\" and has many more jokes of this caliber in it!",

When critics caught wind of their first studio album, they saw Shit as a revival of classic punk, launching the band from small gigs to stardom.\n\nShit became really popular in the United States, and their music was selling well. At least, until rival bands came along. A few after Shit hit the scene, a new band called 'Better Music' burst into the scene from Chicago. Better Music had a sort of edginess to it that Shit didn't seem to have. Shit's profits started falling. Twitter fights and real fights with Better Music became more frequent.  Shit's reputation was tarnished. And when things seemed like they couldn't get any worse, a solo punk artist called 'Only 15' came from Greece, his artistic name coming from his last name, Onlyis. He swept the Grammys that year with his avant-garde take on punk, bringing Shit further down the drain.\n\nAfter attending the Grammys, the members of Shit decided to get a drink at a nearby bar. When Shit arrived, they sat down, and heard their greatest hit blare through the bar. The leader of Shit nudges the man next to him, and says, \"You know this song? We're the band that plays it.\"\n\nThe man turns around, looking familiar to the band. It's Onlyis himself, with his Grammys on the stool next to him. He says, \"This music is Shit?

Talks take place in English at a sushi-restaurant in down-town Tokyo, between the businessman and Mr. Oki, head of the Japanese company.\n\n The negotiations are going very well, but Mr. Oki can't seem to close the deal with the lawyer. The lawyer seems tired from his long trip and aggitated as a result. So - as is accustomed in Japan - mr. Oki arranges a special suprise for the lawyer: a gorgeous Japanese prositute to unwind the lawyer, will be waiting for him in his hotel room.\n\nThe lawyer indeed finds a gorgeous woman waiting for him on his bed in his hotel room. Without any hesitation, he accepts this generous offer from the Japanese firm and begins to have wild, animal sex with the woman. While he's going down on her, she keeps screaming \"Naki Naki!\". As he slowly penetrates her, she still screams \"Naki Naki!!\". 'Wow', he thinks to himself while doing his thing 'this girl's pussy is the tightest thing I've ever felt!'. And when he starts to really pound her, the screams get even louder: \"Naki Naki!! NAKI NAKI!!!\". The lawyer concludes that this must be an expression of great joy in Japanese. Even as they're coming to an amazing climax, her last words are \"... naki..naki...\", before she falls asleep on the bed.\n\nThe next day the lawyer meets up with mr. Oki on the golf course. The lawyer thanks mr. Oki for an amazing night, and mr. Oki is pleased to see him in such a good mood now. The lawyer - pretty full of himself after his spectacular performance last night - proceeds to hit a hole-in-one. Cocky and proud to show off his newly learned Japanese, he exclaims: \"Yeah! Naki naki!\" To which mr. Oki, puzzled, looks at the lawyer and says to him: 'what do you mean \"wrong hole\"?'.",

One night as they were driving to yet another rubber-chicken dinner, Einstein mentioned to his chauffeur (a man who somewhat resembled Einstein in looks & manner) that he was tired of speechmaking. \n\n\"I have an idea, boss,\" his chauffeur said. \"I've heard you give this speech so many times. I'll bet I could give it for you.\" Einstein laughed loudly and said, \"Why not? Let's do it!\" \n\nWhen they arrived at the dinner, Einstein donned the chauffeur's cap and jacket and sat in the back of the room. The chauffeur gave a beautiful rendition of Einstein's speech and even answered a few questions expertly. \n\nThen a supremely pompous professor asked an extremely esoteric question about anti-matter formation, digressing here and there to let everyone in the audience know that he was nobody's fool. Without missing a beat, the chauffeur fixed the professor with a steely stare and said, \"Sir, the answer to that question is so simple that I will let my chauffeur, who is sitting in the back, answer it for me.\"",

Flash accepts and runs so fast he reaches the top before the Bats even gets a step toward the statue.  Batman is laughed at by the rest of the party, but he still continues to drunkenly stumble to the foot of the statue.  Troubled by the look of his walk, Superman tries to talk Batman out of climbing the statue.  Unconvinced, Batman fires his grappling hook and in a swoosh, makes it to the top. Now happy with himself he pushes the Flash off the top and declares victory.  In an instant the Flash returns to the top and removes the drunken Batman's cloak right off his back. \n\n\"Good luck getting down now Bats!\"  says the Flash as he dashes away.

The modern day Chief had never been taught the secrets of the ancients. When he looked at the sky he couldn't tell what the winter was going to be like.\n\nBetter safe than sorry, he said to himself and told his tribe that the winter was indeed expected to be cold and that the members of the village should stock up on firewood to be prepared. \n\nAfter several days, our modern Chief got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, \"Is the coming winter going to be cold?\"\n\n\"It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold,\" the meteorologist at the weather service responded.\n\nSo the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more firewood in order to be prepared. A week later he called the National Weather Service again. \"Does it still look like it is going to be a very cold winter?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the man at National Weather Service again replied, \"It's going to be a very cold winter.\"\n\nThe Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of firewood they could find. Two weeks later the Chief called the National Weather Service again. \"Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" the man replied. \"It's looking more and more like it is going to be one of the coldest winters ever.\"\n\n\"How can you be so sure?\" the Chief asked.\n\nThe weatherman replied, \"The Indians are collecting firewood like crazy.\"",

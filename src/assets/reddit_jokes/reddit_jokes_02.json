Joe for short. \n\nJoe was working away, about 15 minutes from clocking out, and heard a voice in his head that said, \"Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas.\" Joe just thought he overheard a conversation and continued throughout his day. \n\nAbout 2 months later, Joe was at home reading the newspaper after an average day of work, and then again he heard, \"Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas.\" This time joe seemed to be puzzled as the tv nor the radio was on. But he shrugged it off and continued to read.\n\nAbout 3 weeks later, Joe was on a date with Average Jill if you will. Jill was ordering a steak medium rare when suddenly, Joe heard the voice again say \"Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas.\" He asked Jill to be excused, and while in bathroom he rinsed his face with cold water. He was thinking to himself he must be going crazy. But again Joe continued on with his evening. \n\nIt wasn't 3 days before Joe heard the voice again repeat itself about every hour of the day. Then it would become every minute as the day grew dark, and it was starting to drive Joe mad. Joe drank himself to sleep that night. When Joe arose, he headed straight to work, asked his boss for his advance, and then quit immediately . The voices were still constantly repeating \"Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas.\" He then headed straight to the bank and took out all his savings. After he sold his house to the highest bidder. He loaded up his car with food and clothes, and the $235,000 he had tallied up, and set his TomTom for the nearest airport to go to Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nThe whole trip the voice constantly repeated itself, but as soon as he arrived in Las Vegas, the voice stopped. There was silence, something Joe treasured at the moment. He cracked a smile, but after about 5 solid blissful minutes, the voice began to say, \"Go to the nearest casino,\" over and over again. Felling forced to do so, he headed to the first casino he could find, with his $235k. As soon as he stepped in the casino, he heard the voice say, \"Cash in all your money for chips.\" This strange voice was actually starting to build up confidence in Joe. He thought to himself, if this voice has been in his head and got him this far, then it must know what it's doing. \n\nHis chin was high as he cashed in his entire life into those gorgeous chips in Vegas. Once he had his chips the voice says, \"Go to the third roulette table in the back left of the casino.\" Not even being able to see back that far, Joe listened. Sure enough there were 6 roulette tables exactly where the said, and Joe made his way to third table. The voice then said the instant Joe approached the table, \"Put all your money on Red 6.\" Without hesitation, Joe put his entire life on Red 6, $235k. The roulette table then spun, and then the ball was dropped. It bounced around as the roulette kept spinning, then suddenly it began to lose speed. The ball settled into its hole, but the numbers were too hard to read because of the speed of the spin. Then you hear the dealer call out, \"Loser! It landed on Black 13.\"\nJoe was devastated, and then the voice suddenly said in a surprised yet disappointed tone,\".....Fuck.\"",

Henry here is the horniest rooster you will ever see!\"\nSo the farmer took Henry back to the farm. Before setting him loose in the hen house though, he gave Henry a little pep talk. \"Henry\", he said, \"I'm counting on you to do your stuff.\" And without a word, Henry then strutted into the hen house.\nHenry was as fast as he was furious, mounting each hen like a thunderbolt. There was much squawking and many feathers flying, till Henry had finished having his way with each hen. But Henry didn't stop there, he went in to the barn and mounted all the horses, one by one and still at the same frantic pace. Then he went to the pig house where he did the same.\nThe farmer, watching all of this with disbelief, cried out, \"Stop, Henry, you'll kill yourself.\" But Henry continued, seeking out each farm animal in the same manner.\nWell the next morning, the farmer looked out and saw Henry lying there on his lawn. His legs were up in the air, his eyes rolled back, and his long tongue hanging out. A buzzard was already circling above Henry.\nThe farmer walked up to Henry saying, \"Oh you poor thing, look what you did, you've gone and killed yourself. I warned you big buddy.\"\n\"Shhhhh,\" Henry whispered, \"The buzzard is getting closer.\"",

Once there he was greeted by an old monk. \n\n\"Good evening.. ehm.. sir? Something went wrong when booking my hotel. Could I possibly stay here for just one night?\"\n\n\"Of course!\" said the monk. \"We have a room just for tourists like you, we can even offer you some food in the morning.

I mean, he got what he wanted. A place to spend the night, and that's all you can ask for. But when he awoke in the middle of the night to the strangest sound he had ever heard in his entire life his curiosity creeped back to him. He NEEDED to know what this unearthly sound was.

I NEED to know the source of this sound.\"\n\n\"Very well\", the old monk seemed pleased with the answer. \"To become a monk, you must travel the world and count every blade of grass and every grain of sand. Once you do that, you become a monk.\"\n\nThe man walked out of the temple. His journey had now begun. He started traveling all across the world. Counting every blade of grass and every grain of sand. \nMany, many years later he returned to the temple. The old monk were, to his surprise, still alive, waiting for him on the top of the stairs to the temple. \n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"I counted it to 56738370921 blades of grass, and 27489173408820 grains of sand!\" the man said with triumph on his face.\n\n\"I can see your dedication. Congratulations, you are now a monk.\"\n\n\"So... I get to see the source of the sound?\"\n\n\"Yes, you may. Follow me please.\"\n\nSo he followed the old monk.

The first tune the pianist plays is an uplifting jazzy number, not too involving, yet utterly melodic.\n \nAt the end the thrilled barman cries,\n\"Wonderful! Wonderful! What was that called?\"\n\"That song, you big nosed fucking twat, was called 'Excuse Me Prime Minister But I Just Spunked In Your Fucking Daughter's Eye, And Now The Cunt's Blind.' \"\n\"Oh\" says the manager, somewhat taken aback, \"err, can you play me another? Something a little less lively maybe?\"\n\"Fucking wanker...\" interjects the pianist before launching into a powerful ballad of such beauty that it leaves the manager in tears.\n \nThe manager, through his teardrops asks him the title.\n\"That little number was called 'Sometimes When You Fuck A Bird Up The Shit Box You Get Crap On Your Bell End.' \"\n\"I see\" says the manager. \"Have you got any songs with less offensive titles?\"\n\"Well there's my jazz number 'Do You Want Me To Spit In Your Ringpiece', or there's the epic 'I Don't Give A Fuck If You're Older My Dear, You've Still Got Fucking Cracking Jugs' \".\n \n\"Look,\" says the manager, \"I think you're a superb pianist but the title of your songs are a little dodgy, to say the least.

Just as he has shot his load he hears himself being re-introduced over the sound system, so he rushes back to the stage to finish his act.\n \nAfter the show he is at the bar relaxing when the same blonde approaches him.\n\"Hi\" she says.\n\"Oh, hello\" he winces, struggling to hold in the expletives.\nShe leans over and whispers in his ear,\n\"Do you know your cock is hanging out of your trousers and spunk is dribbling onto your shoes?\"\nPlacing his beer confidently on the bar, the pianist grins, looks her square in the eye and says,\n\"Know it?

To become an American citizen Vinny has to go to court and stand in front of a judge.\n\nVinny brings his whole family to the courtroom to cheer him on. They are a very loud and rambunctious Italian family.\nVinny stands in front of the judge and the judge says, \"Ok Vinny, before you become an American citizen I have to ask you a few questions about American history\"\n\nVinny very confidently says, \"Hey, not a problem judge.\" As he looks back to his family, he can see that they are all very excited and waiting with eager anticipation.\n\nThe judge says \"Ok Vinny, who was the first president of the United States?\"\n\nVinny responds, \"Oh judge, that's-a easy one... George-a Washington!\"\n\nImmediately Vinny's whole family stands up and erupts into applause. You can hear \"Hey Vinny!\" \"That-a boy!\" \"Way to go!\"\nThe judge puts his hands up \"Ok, ok, everybody calm down... Second question, when was the Declaration of Independence signed?\"\n\nVinny confidently pulls on his collar a bit, put his hands out in front of him, and says \"Judge, another easy one... 1776!\"\nOnce again his family erupts, making more noise than the last time. \"Way to go Vinny!\" \"That-a boy!\"\n\n\"Calm down, calm down\" says the judge.\n\nAt this point Vinny is pretty confident. He is looking back at his family, giving them a couple of \"Hey-yo, howya doins\" and they are loving it.\n\nIt seems as if the judge has lost all control of the courtroom. The family is on their feet and Vinny is in love with himself.\n\nThe judge says, \"Ok Vinny last question.\"\n\n\"Not-a problem judge\" Vinny replies.\n\nThe judge kind of smirks, knowing there is no way that Vinny gets this one. He says, \"Who assassinated Abraham Lincoln?\"\n\nThe crowd goes silent.\n\nVinny is looking around with his head down, clearly very distraught. It becomes very apparent that Vinny will not get the answer to this one.\n\nVinny nervously grabs his collar and replies, \"Hey-a judge... well I-a... I don't know that one.\"\n\nHis family erupts in the biggest uproar of the night. People are now jumping up and down in excitement. It seems as if the clock just his midnight on New Years Day. The judge is banging his gavel, completely confused as to what is going on. Vinny turns to his family and raises his hands high in the air as if he just won a grand prize.\n\nFrom deep within the crowd you hear a voice shout out with great pride... \"That-a boy Vinny! Don't-a squeal on-a nobody!\"",

He was a very handsome man, so he had no trouble finding one that he loved. They fell into a passionate love. He said to his wife on the wedding day \u201cI\u2019m so glad I get to marry the love of my life, but I have one request.\u201d His wife replied \u201cOkay honey, anything for you\u201d.  \n&nbsp;  \n\u201cYou can know anything about me, I\u2019ll tell you\u201d the man said \u201cJust don\u2019t ask me about the two black sharks in the white pool.\u201d His wife thought this was very odd and shrugged it off, thinking nothing of it. As time went on, she became more curious. She developed an obsession with it. One day, she couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and asked her husband \u201cI know you told me not to ask, but I really want to know. What\u2019s with the two black sharks in a white pool?\u201d   \n&nbsp;  \nThe man lost it. He went into a rage and grabbed a chair, beating his wife with it and smacking her into the wall. She snapped her neck as he came to his senses. He quickly cleaned up the mess and buried the body in the back yard.  \n&nbsp;  \nDistraught, the man spent much of his time inside his house. Eventually he got the courage to go outside and look once more for love. He fell hard for a very attractive model that also admired the young millionaire. On their wedding he was filled with so much joy that he could love again. That night, he said to her. \u201cHoney, I really do love you and I know you love me, but I have one request.\u201d His wife replied \u201cOf course darling, anything for you\u201d.  \n&nbsp;  \n\u201cYou can know anything about me and I\u2019ll be glad to tell you\u201d the man says \u201cWhatever you do, just don\u2019t ask about the two black sharks in the white pool.\u201d His wife was very curious, but because she loved him and decided to drop it. \u201cOkay darling. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d But as time went on she became increasingly curious and decided to ask him one night after some vigorous sex. \u201cDarling,\u201d she said \u201cI know you told me not to ask, but what is the deal with the two black shark in a white pool?\u201d  \n&nbsp;  \nThe man became furious in his attack and started to smother her with the pillow. She writhed for a couple of seconds and eventually suffocated. He came to his senses, weeping that he had killed his wife and went to bury her in the back yard.  \n&nbsp;  \nThe man mourned his second wife for a few months, losing all hope in ever finding love again. One day the millionaire got courage to go out drinking with some buddies and met this lovely blonde reporter. They had a great night and went back to his place to have more drinks. Over the next few months they kept seeing each other. The man finally got the courage to propose and they were married within the year.  \n&nbsp;  \nOn their wedding day he was filled with so much joy that he had found someone to love and spend his life with. That evening he said to her. \u201cOh love, you know that I adore you and I want to be with you, but I have one request.\u201d His wife replied \u201cAnything for you my love\u201d.  \n&nbsp;  \n\u201cYou can know anything about me, nothing is secret\u201d the man said \u201cBut do not ask me about the two black sharks in a white pool\u201d. Having been a reporter, his wife had been successful by getting the scoop on just about every good story, but she loved her husband and respected his wish. Each day that passed she grew more curious, as was her instincts as a reporter. She finally got the courage to ask. \u201cMy love\u201d she said \u201cI know you don\u2019t want me to ask, but I am very curious! What is with the two black sharks in a white pool?\u201d  \n&nbsp;  \nThe man grabs a knife from the kitchen and goes after his wife, stabbing her to death. He realized that he killed his wife, and wept. He quickly buried her in the back yard. One of his neighbors watched him dragging a body and decided to notify the police.  The police arrived at the house and the man answered \u201cGood evening officers, what can I help you with?\u201d  \n&nbsp;  \n\u201cSir we have some information about you and a dead body\u201d one officer says. At this time the neighbor comes over and notifies the police to check the back yard. The police come in and see one freshly dug patch of grass next to a white pool that had two black sharks in it. \u201cWhat\u2019ve you been digging here?\u201d says the other officer. They call in backup to dig in the backyard of the millionaire and find three dead bodies, after which they detain the man.  \n&nbsp;  \nIn the police station they interrogate the man. \u201cWhy do you have three dead bodies in your backyard?\u201d The millionaire was an honest man. In tears he told them about his wives that he\u2019d accidentally killed. \u201cI loved each one of them\u201d says the millionaire \u201cBut even when I told them not to, each one of them asked me about the two black sharks in a white pool.\u201d  \n&nbsp;  \nConfused, the police officer interrogating the man asks \u201cWhat is with the two black sharks in the white pool? We saw them at your house.\u201d The man becomes enraged and starts to attack the officer. The officer fearing for his life grabs his gun and shoots the man in the head.  \n&nbsp;  \nTo this day nobody knows anything about the two black sharks in a white pool.  \n&nbsp;  \nEdit: a word and a requested TL;DR\n",

We did it then and there.\" \n\nThe pastor solemnly shakes his head. \"I am truly sorry but I can't let you into my congregation.\" \n\nThe newlywed husband says, \"That's quite alright, father, for all its worth, I don't think they'll let us back into the Home Depot either.\" ",

Having watched the plumber fixing the pipes, he thought it didn't look to difficult and that becoming a plumber might earn more money than being a professor.\n\n\"I'm sorry to bother you, but is your employer hiring?\" Asked the professor.\n\n\"Yes, they are,\" replied the plumber, \"but there is one thing you must know before you apply.\"\n\n\"And what might that be?\"\n\n\"They don't like educated people very much, so if you want to get the job you will need to lie and say you only have a 6th grade education.\"\n\nThe professor followed his advice, and got a job as a plumber. He quit his job at the University.

They were enrolled in night classes.\n\nOn the first day, everything went well. Being an educated person, the professor already knew all the curriculum, but he made sure to put in a wrong answer here and there so nobody would find out.\n\nOn the second day, everything went smoothly as well, until the instructor asked the professor for the formula for the area of a circle. As he walked to the front of the room, his mind went totally blank. He could not remember the formula, no matter how hard he tried. \n\nHe frantically wrote equations and formulas on the blackboard, trying to find the formula he needed. He found something after several minutes of frantic scribbling, but alas, it was incorrect. He felt defeated, knowing his secret would be revealed and he hadn't even gotten the question right.\n\nThe plumbers quietly talked among themselves. The professor thought about what insults they might be coming up with, and what would happen to him now that they knew he was educated. They talked for a minute, before, apparently at a conclusion, one plumber stood up.

She informed me he had a rare condition that would result in cardiac arrest unless he rubbed one out every couple hours.  I told her to keep me away from that guy. \nWe climbed up one more flight of stairs and turned down another corridor with rooms lining either side. \n\"It's just ahead sir,\" she said, \" just through the double doors at the end.\" \nI was still a shook up about the scene I'd just witnessed one level below, so she took me the rest of the way. \nSure enough I see another man, a FULLY grown man, yanking on his thing. HARD. \n\"What the hell is going on around here?\" I asked her. \n\"That man has the same issue as the fellow downstairs. Isn't that interesting?\" She exclaimed. \n'Hardly,' I thought. We kept walking. \nJust then, to no avail, I look into another room, unable to keep my prying eyes away, and there it was.

Things are slow so the bartender says to the guy \"Hey you want to see something cool?\" The guy says sure. So they both hop into the bartenders car and start driving. They drive for 30 min before they drive up to a gate. The bartender gets out and opens the gate, gets back in and drives through, and then gets out and closes the gate. Now they are at a river. They ditch the car and get into a little paddle boat and paddle across the river. At the end is a gate. The bartender walks up opens the gate, they walk through and then he closes the gate. Now they are at a 2nd river, which is twice as large as the first river. The paddle boat across. Get to another gate and the bartender opens it, they go through, and then he closes it. Now they are at a mountain. They promptly hike over the mountain quick and come up to a gate. Bartender opens, they go through, he closes. Now they are at a 2nd mountain twice as tall as the first mountain. They hike over this one now as well. Then they come up to another gate. The bartender opens said gate, they walk through, he closes said gate. Finally, they have arrived at a cave. The bartender cups his hands around his mouth and yells \"Here little green man, little green man!\" All of a sudden this tiny little green man comes bee-bopping up. The guy is amazed at this phenomenon and decides he wants to touch the little green man. Just as he is reaching out the bartender pulls him back exclaiming \"You must never touch this little green man!\" The man obliges and they leave the cave. So they come up to a gate, the bartender opens it, they go through, he closes it. They hike over the 2nd mountain twice as tall as the first mountain. Come up to a gate, opens, walks through, closes. They hike over the first mountain. Come to the gate, open it, walk through, close it. Now they paddle boat across the 2nd river twice as large as the first river. Come to the gate. Open, walks through, closes. They paddle boat across the first river. Open gate, walk through, close gate. Drive back to the bar. So now the guy is sitting there just thinking over and over wow I could really make some money off of this little green man. So he gets in his own car this time and drives himself to the first gate. He opens it, drives through it, and then closes it. He then paddle boats across the first river. Gets to the gate, opens it, goes through it, and then closes it. He then paddle boats across the 2nd river which is twice as big as the first river. Gets to the gate, opens, goes through, closes. Now he is hiking over the first mountain. Gets to the gate, opens it, goes through it, and then closes it. Then he hikes over the 2nd mountain that is twice as tall as the first mountain. Opens the gate, walks through, closes it. He walks up to the cave and yells \"Here little green man, little green man!\" and sure enough the little green man comes bee-bopping out. The guy thinks to himself this is awesome! He reaches down to pick the little green man up and as soon as he touches him the little green man starts going berserk! The man is startled and takes off running away from the little green man. He runs to the gate, opens it, runs through, closes it and starts just sprinting over the 2nd mountain twice as tall as the first mountain. Gets to the gate, opens it, runs through, closes it. The little green man chasing behind the entire way. So now the man runs over the first mountain. Opens the gate, runs through, closes it. Little green man still going stride for stride. So he gets in the paddle boat and furiously rows across the 2nd river twice as large as the first river. Gets to the gate, opens it, runs through, closes it. The little green man swimming right along after him. So the guy paddles across the first river gets to the gate, opens it, runs through, closes it and then he jumps in his car and starts driving. The little green man all along the way is very visible in the mans rear view mirror. The man starts to panic so he drives to the airport. He runs up to the front desk and says \"give me a ticket to the furthest place possible!\" The lady at the front desk says well that would be New Zealand. So she gives him a ticket and he boards and the plane takes off. All the time the man is in the plane he can see a tiny tiny green dot on the ground. After 16 hours the plane finally lands and the man steps off. At this point the little green man comes limping up to him. He is tired, hurt, and exhausted. The man thinks OK I'm out of options I should finally give this little green man a chance to explain himself. So the man stands there while the little green man limps up to him, touches his leg and yells \"TAG YOUR'E IT!\"",

They finally found a pilot who would take on the job for an extra $5,000. \nThey packed in their gear and they were off for an event of a lifetime. They got to the lake and were able to land, with some difficulty due to the snags and rocks in the lake. They arranged to be picked up in a week and the floatplane returned to Fairbanks.\nThe next week was grand. They each caught a record size lake trout; shot a moose and an elk. When the floatplane returned they attempted to load their gear and the trout, moose and elk. The pilot would not let them pack all of their trophies, as it would cause the plane to be overloaded.\nThe administrators indicated that they must have the trophies as they were administrators and no one would believe their stories unless they had proof of their adventures. \nThey agreed, after giving the pilot an extra $6,000, that they would leave their gear and take out only the trophies. The pilot would return later for the gear that was being left at the lake.\nThe pilot was still concerned about the weight in the plane and taxied to the far end of the lake and gunned the motor. They rocketed across the lake but the plane was not becoming airborne as they approached the trees. The plane came off of the water and then slammed into the trees. \nAfter a few minutes one of the administrators crawled out of the plane and made his way to a large rock on which he stood to evaluate their situation.

I'm a bit bored at the moment, so I've embellished it a bit! enjoy :)\n\nSo, this guy is hiking in the Himalayas, as you do, and, as he's hiking up the narrow, rock-strewn paths, he realises that it is getting late, and darkness comes early in the mountains, and he was still some distance from the next town. He starts walking more quickly, but it became dark and he couldn't see much in front of him. Just as the panic was setting in, he rounded a corner and lo, there was a light in the darkness. A monastery, not on any map, appearing, just as it was sorely needed.\nThe guy thankfully stumbles up to the great door and bangs on it loudly. After a short time, it slowly creaked open to reveal a large, almost jolly, monk with a huge smile on his face. \"Come in, weary traveller\", he says. Wondering how the happy monk knew English, but not wanting to look a gift horse in the mouth, the traveller thankfully entered the monastery.\n\"Please join us for dinner,\" the monk said, with that warming and happy smile. \"it will be, as always, a very joyous and happy occasion\".\n\"Thank you so much\" says the traveller, as he is shown to a room to refresh himself before the meal.\n\nAt the meal, held in the large Hall, with all of the monastery's inhabitants together, the traveller is seated as a guest of honour, next to the Abbot himself. Small talk ensues as they partake of the feast set before them.\nAll of the monks seem very happy and friendly. Our weary traveller is confused (thinking monasteries were supposed to be quiet, dull affairs), but again, doesn't want to ask any awkward questions, and so is happy to go along.\nAll of a sudden, one of the monks at a lower table stands up and says loudly, \"24!\". The other monks start chuckling, and nodding their heads in agreement. One or two even bang their cups on the table.\nAnother monk then stands up and says, \"37\". A bit more obvious a reaction this time - the monks chuckle more loudly, a few laughing out loud and more cup-on-table banging. Even the Abbot chuckles to himself.\nA third monk, \"65!\". Loud laughter, patting on backs, more cup on table bangings, even a few feet stompings - clearly the monks are having a  good time!\nThe traveller, however, is as confused as all hell! Just as he was about to ask the Abbot what was going on, the Abbot himself stood up and shouted \"17!\". More laughter, more appreciation, clapping and table banging. The monks were loving it!\nThe Abbot sat down, and saw the confused look on the traveller's face. \"My son\", he said. \"We love a good laugh, here at the monastery. We tell jokes at dinner time, and we all enjoy each others' company. In fact, we tell the jokes so often, that we ended up just numbering them - it makes it so much easier to just say the number of the joke. Why don't you try it?\"\n\nThe traveller thinks for a bit and then stands up and shouts out \"45\". More laughter, more feet stomping, nods of appreciation, comments of 'our guest is joining our traditions\" and that sort of thing.\nThe traveller is quite pleased with the response, and thinks to himself, \"I'll have another go!\"\nSo he stands up and shouts out \"112!!\".\nThere was a moment of shocked silence, and then a deafening roar as every monk there laughed loudly, banging on the tables, stomping their feet, patting each other on the back, pointing to our traveller in obvious appreciation. Some even wiped tears of laughter from their eyes.\nThe traveller sat down again next to the Abbot, feeling quite proud of himself and turned to the Abbot saying, \"They liked that one, did they?\"\n\"Oh yes,\" said the Abbot, \"That was a good one - they haven't heard that one before!\"",

And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?\n\n\"Open your eyes!\" says a voice. \"C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!\". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. \"Who are you??\" The politician asks. \"Well, I'm Satan!\" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. \"Welcome to Hell!\" \"Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?\" he asks. Satan throws him a wink. \"Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside...\" Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. \"It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!\" says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep... And is woken up by St Peter. \"So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?\" \"No sir!\" says the man. \"So then\" says St Peter \"you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on\". \"Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell\" says the politician. \"Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!\" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.\n\nThe man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. \"What's this??\" He cries. \"Where's the hotel??

        "body": "... there was a village that lived on the edges of the kingdom, by a mountainside. The village was intially called \"Trifville\", as a play on how worthless it was to haggle in the village market - over time, people began affectionately calling the village \"Triddville\", and the villagers, \"Tridds\".\n\nThe town itself was very religious; there were four sectors of the village - the Christian sector, which followed the teachings of the town priest; the Islamic sector, which followed the teachings of the town imam; and the Jewish sector, which followed the teachings of the town rabbi. The former two were born in the village, and the lattermost was initially a traveler from another village who chose to stay.\n\nOne day, a giant appeared at the top of the mountain by the town, bellowing and shaking the ground with each breath. Naturally, the people panicked - until each of the religious figures claimed that the monster was a punishment from the heavens for having a poor market. The villagers were then torn amongst themselves; there was much rioting and pillaging between the three sectors, until a small boy, furious with the riots, screamed at the top of his lungs, \"IF THOSE BASTARDS ALL THINK THEY KNOW WHAT THE TROUBLE IS, LET THEM FIX IT!\"\n\nThere was silence.\n\nThere was more silence.\n\nThere was prolonged silence.\n\nA slow chant rose from the villagers, \"GIANT - THEY SLAY\". It got faster. It got more energetic.\n\nIt got wild.\n\nEventually, the villagers raided the homes of the priest, imam, and rabbi (which were previously untouched), and threatened them to stoning if they had not solved the giant problem.\n\nWhile they had been reluctant at first, when the villagers had kidnapped all of their daughters as hostages, the priest, imam, and rabbi seemed overly enthusiastic to solve the problem immediately.  \n\nFirst, the priest made the trek up the large mountain. Being the middle-aged man he was, he took a week to climb the sizable spike. When he encountered the giant, he said, \"Brother Giant, can you not spare the villagers of your incessant breathing and stomping. My young girl wakes up every night, scared, because of your actions.\"\n\nThe giant, without a word, kicks the priest in the testicles so hard that the priest loses his balance, and falls backward down the mountain. He is dead before he touches the base of the mountain.\n\nSecond, the imam made the hike up the large mountain. Being the somewhat seniorly man he was, he took a two weeks to climb the colossal mound. When he encountered the giant, he said, in Arabic, \"Brother Giant, shall you spare the villagers of your ever frequent breathing and stomping. My dearest children wake up every night, scared, because of your actions.\"\n\nThe giant, with a puzzled look, kicks the imam in the balls so hard that the imam loses his balance, and somersaults backward down the mountain. He is dead before he can scream.\n\nLastly, the rabbi made the journey to the top of Mount Giant. At the base of the mountain, he saw the rotting bodies of the priest and the imam; their abdomens were noticably caved in. The rabbi, slightly unnerved, just muttered to himself, *\"...just a test... it's just a test...\"* Being the elderly man he was, he took a three weeks to climb the colossal mound. When he encountered the giant, he said, \"Brother Giant, could you please leave us?\"\n\nSuprisingly enough, the Giant said, \"Okee dokee,\" and, from then on, the village was not disturbed from the Giant any longer. The rabbi, overwhelmed by his sucess, blurted out, \"My brothers - the priest and the imam, I've seen them at the base of this mountain, with their abdomens caved inwards. Why haven't I recieved the same fate?\"\n\nThe Giant, smiles and says, \"Silly rabbi! Kicks are for Tridds!\"\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Note: I'm supportive of all religions. This is just a really long joke with a ton of unnessisary filler.*\n",

        "body": "On a planet called Cheeriolia, the population is divided into three societal classes: Cheerios are the lower class, Applejacks are in the middle, and Fruit Loops are the wealthy elite. One cannot intermarry between classes, unfortunately, and discrimination is rampant between them. An authoritarian government keeps very close tabs on individual classes and poverty lines criss-cross through big cities. Cheerios are doomed to a certain limit of wealth, Applejacks cannot earn more than Fruit Loops, and Fruit Loops must pay even heavier taxes. Life is difficult, and each class has its own unique complaints with the way they are forced to live.\n\nA Cheerio named Joe worked at a local Wal-Mart as a cashier, a position he had held for years because his boss is a penny-pinching Applejack. One day, he was bagging groceries for a fellow Cheerio when a Fruit Loop walked through the door, frantically darting her eyes around, panting. She ran down a couple isles, found what she was looking for, and hurried to the check-out area. The Fruit Loop had jumped into the same express lane that Joe was manning. Even though the line was moving quickly, it was an especially busy day and there were quite a few people in the queue. She exclaimed,\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t this line move any faster?\u201d\n\nThe Cheerio in front of her shook his head and chuckled to himself. The Fruit Loop didn\u2019t notice. She stood with her one item tucked under her arm, glaring at the rest of the line. Five minutes later, she was at the line\u2019s head. Joe looked at her, in awe of her beauty. She was, perhaps, the most beautiful Fruit Loop he had ever seen. His mouth fell open as she said,\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t usually shop here\u2026\u201d\n\nHer pejorative comment had no effect on Joe, who still could not believe his eyes. The Fruit Loop had to snap her fingers in Joe\u2019s face for him to finally take her credit card. She paid and left, but Joe could not stop thinking about her. He resolved to find out who she was and make her fall in love with him. There was only one problem: he was a Cheerio, and she was a Fruit Loop\u2014even if she *did* love him, it was against the law for them to marry. Still, the thought of love and marriage was hopeful, and it occupied his mind for the next two years.\n\nDuring those next two years, Joe never stopped thinking about the beautiful Fruit Loop. He worked as hard as he could, bought a chin-up bar to hand in the doorway of his tiny apartment, and subscribed to a gym membership. Joe lost some weight, started running in the mornings, and let his beard grow out. One day, much to his surprise, he awoke to a brand-new, hot-pink body that smelled very sweetly of apples. He had made the jump from Cheerio to Applejack! \n\nThat morning, Joe walked through the doors of the Wal-Mart and his co-workers stared at him, with their mouths agape. He continued working as a cashier, but one day the CEO of Wal-Mart fired Joe\u2019s boss and promoted him to manager at the request of his co-workers, who knew his humble nature and diligence would help their local Wal-Mart. He doubled their pay, and even helped stock shelves when he had nothing else to do. \n\nA few months passed, and Joe still worked out after the workday ended, but he became very lonely. The beautiful Fruit Loop still was all he thought about, so he devoted even more of his time to work and committed himself to physical fitness. In his deluded aspirations, he sought to win the heart of the Fruit Loop without even knowing her name. \n\nJust as his hope was running low, the same Fruit Loop entered the Wal-Mart, again looking very rushed, and ran down the aisle frantically looking for another item. As she was running around a corner, she ran into Joe, who was carrying a stack of boxes. They collapsed onto the floor. The Fruit Loop began to shout obscenities as Joe helped her up.\n\n\u201cSorry, miss.\u201d\n\nShe sighed.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. I ran into you. I should have been watching.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Joe.\u201d\n\nHis voice quivered slightly, and he held out his hand.\n\n\u201cVanessa.\u201d\n\nJoe led Vanessa to the cashiers, where he let his Cheerio employee go on break so he could check Vanessa out. He took a good look at her, and it was as if not a day had passed since he had seen her last. The only difference now was that he was a jacked-up Applejack who felt much closer to winning Vanessa\u2019s heart. She took her item and left once again. Thoughts of marrying Vanessa didn\u2019t leave his mind for three more years.\n\nIn those three years, Joe committed every waking moment to physical fitness. He was promoted at work and given authority over all the Wal-Marts in the tri-state area. Joe was still kind to his employees and gave them high salaries, but the economy was booming and he earned quite a bit of money without working very long hours. He attended some formal parties for Wal-Mart executive Fruit Loops and saw they way they lived, so luxuriously. Joe envied it. But all his wishes and hopes relied on his body and what he was made of. He did not lose hope. And one day, much to Joe\u2019s glee, he awoke to a brand-new, sugar-coated, bright blue body. He was finally a Fruit Loop!\n\nThat morning, Joe walked from his penthouse flat to the office and, like he usually did, ran up the stairs. All the cubicles were full when he entered, and everyone peered over to get a look at his new body. All the Applejacks in accounting were amazed, all the Applejacks in IT were amazed, and all the Applejacks in administration were amazed. His boss, the Fruit Loop directly under the CEO, took notice quickly and put in a good word with the CFO, who put in an even better word with the CEO. Both thought very highly of Joe and both thought he would make the perfect CEO one day. No-one knew that the CFO was sleeping with the CEO\u2019s wife, however, and when the CEO found out, he delved so deep into alcohol that the board of trustees voted to let him go and replace him with Joe. \n\nOne day, Joe was walking down the street to the office when he passed Vanessa. She had not aged one day in the last three years, and he immediately stopped to reintroduce himself. Vanessa was surprised it was Joe, because she remembered him to be a mere Applejack, but she did remember him nonetheless. He asked her out for some drinks later that night, and she agreed.\n\nLater that night, they met at a bar and got to talking. Joe discovered that Vanessa, despite her goddess-like beauty, had never been married and had only dated a couple other Fruit Loops. He was just as surprised when Vanessa said that she was interested in dating himself. Joe replied with a definite \u201cyes\u201d without hesitation. His dream had come true; now he was to only win her heart. When Joe got home that night, he put himself through the most strenuous workout he had ever done and fell asleep immediately after he had done his last deadlift. \n\nVanessa and Joe dated for eight months. Then, one day, on the terrace of his penthouse overlooking the harbor, Joe asked her to marry him. Vanessa screamed \u201cyes!\u201d\n\nOver the next eight years, Joe and Vanessa were faithful to each other. They had three healthy, beautiful children, and Joe continued working as the CEO of Wal-Mart. The company flourished and Joe was able to buy a large mansion out in the country where he hoped to raise his children. He kept the penthouse in the city in case he had to work late, but most of the time he was able to drive home and read his kids their bedtime stories. Vanessa never aged a day, and Joe loved her with all his heart. He had finally fulfilled his dream, and life was good.\n\nOne day, Joe was finished with an important meeting and decided to clock out and drive home to surprise his children. He had forgotten what time the school day ended and arrived in the early afternoon at his mansion. A sleek, black sedan was in the driveway, and Joe didn\u2019t know whose it was. He cracked open the front door slowly, and went straight to the bedroom without calling his wife\u2019s name. Joe had a terrible feeling in his stomach. He threw the door to the master bedroom wide open and saw Vanessa in bed with the old CFO. He screamed obscenities at him and threw him out of his house. Vanessa tried to explain that it meant nothing, that she still loved him, but Joe would have none of it. He packed a bag, booked a plane ticket, called the office saying that he was taking a brief leave of absence, and drove to the airport, distraught. \n\nHe boarded a plane destined for Hawai\u2019i and watched as his home grew smaller and smaller in the distance. Joe decided he would stay in Hawai\u2019i for a week to get his head straight and figure out what to do. When the plane arrived the next day, Joe found a five-star hotel right next to the beach. The view was lovely, and every morning before the sun was at its hottest, he would walk along the waves and think about his life. He was troubled, but at the same time he was proud of himself and what he had made of himself. Joe wasn\u2019t sure what to do.\n\nOne morning, he passed a young, beautiful woman walking the other way. She was a Fruit Loop, like himself, and though she was not as pretty as Vanessa, she was still breathtaking. Joe stopped, introduced himself, and offered to take her up to a favorite bar by the beach for some fruit juice. The Fruit Loop said her name was Merlot and that she, too, was on vacation. They had a few drinks and talked all afternoon; they told each other their darkest secrets and, by sunset, Joe felt like he knew Merlot better than he had ever known his wife. As the moon was rising, they kissed under the stars, and Joe took Merlot back to his hotel room.\n\nThe next day, they both walked along the water. The passed the same bar they had stopped at the day before, and a sign hung in the window: \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re closed for the Juice Festival on 3rd Street.\u201d\n\nThe couple was puzzled, so the walked hand in hand to the location the sign specified. A large, frightening bouncer-Applejack stood in the doorway, so Joe gave him a tip and he let them in. The party inside was loud and exciting. Along the far wall, rows and rows of booths surrounded a buffet line. The music playing was so catchy, however, that Merlot dragged Joe onto the dancefloor. Hours passed, and they were soon tired. Looking for a place to sit, the picked a booth. They kissed again. Joe felt like a new breakfast cereal. \n\nSmells coming from the buffet were so enticing that they had to try a little of everything. They stood in line and chatted up some of the other vacationers who were there for the food and drink. Soon, all the salty food had rendered them both very thirsty. When Joe offered to go find the line for the juice they had seen advertised, he stood between the islands of food and looked around. He didn\u2019t see any juice. There was no punch line.",

One day, Chad was in a bar, drinking a tequila. Carter, drunk, came over to Chad and punched him as hard as a wooden plank could. Chad got angry and retaliated, kicking Carter in the face. They got into a bloody and violent bar fight. They both got arrested. They were sentenced to 8 months in jail, and a hefty fine for damages done to the bar. While in jail, Carter and Chad found that they had many similarities, and soon became best friends in jail. When they got out, they decided to start a business together. \n3 years later, Chad and Carter's Hardware store was very successful and they were making tons of money. But, one day, they realized that one of their suppliers had stopped shipping them products! And this wasn't even the first time that they have done this! The 2 wooden planks got very angry, and decided to go give the owner of the factory a piece of their mind. They went over to the factory, which was called, \"Plank and Nail Industries.\" Chad thought that this name was a bit creepy. They entered the factory, and saw a quite normal looking lobby, with a quite normal looking wooden plank at the counter. \"Hey\", Chad said. \"We would like to speak with your piece of trash manager.\" The clerk gave them a weird look, but picked up his phone nonetheless and called him. \"Please wait 5 minutes while he comes down,\" he said. So they waited. The owner didn't come. \"Where is he?\" Carter said. \"He is a very busy man,\" the clerk replied. They waited half an hour. Then 2 hours. Eventually even the clerk seemed very confused. 4 hours later, an angry Chad shouted, \"Where is he!?\" The clerk replied \"I am really not sure. Please just wait a few more minutes.\" Chad sighed, and then looked to Carter. \"How are you feeling?\" Carter smacked his lips and said,\n\n\"I'm board\"",

She knows about their best friends, romances, secret hopes and dreams, favorite foods, fears and dental appointments.\nA man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.\n\nMaturity\n===========\nWomen mature much faster than men. Most 17-year old females can function as adults. Most 17-year old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.\n\nHandwriting\n===========\nTo their credit, men do not decorate their penmanship. They just chicken-scratch. Women use scented, colored stationary and they dot their \u201ci\u2019s\u201d with circles and hearts. Women use ridiculously large loops in their \u201cp\u2019s\u201d and \u201cg\u2019s\u201d. It is a royal pain to read a note from a woman. Even when she\u2019s dumping you, she\u2019ll put a smiley face at the end of the note.\n\nGroceries\n===========\nA woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes out to the store and buys these things. A man waits till the only items left in his fridge are half a lime and a beer. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reaches the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter than the Clampett\u2019s car on Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 12-items-or-less lane.\n\nGoing Out\n===========\nWhen a man says he is ready to go out, it means he is ready to go out. When a woman says she is ready to go out, it means she WILL be ready to go out, as soon as she finds her earrings and finishes putting on her makeup.\n\nLow Blows\n===========\nLet\u2019s say a man and a woman are watching a boxing match on TV. One of the boxers is felled by a low blow. The woman says, \u201cOh, gee. That must have hurt.\u201d The man groans and doubles over, and actually FEELS the pain.\n\nLaundry\n===========\nWomen do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul and take his mountain of clothes to the laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the laundromat.\n\nThe Wedding\n===========\nWhen reminiscing about weddings, women talk about \u201cthe ceremony\u201d. Men talk about \u201cthe bachelor party\u201d.",

We were in a quandary as to where the statue should be placed. It was not proper to place it beside the statue of George Washington, who never told a lie, or beside Barack Hussein Obama, who never told the truth, since Hillary could never tell the difference.\nWe finally decided to place it beside Christopher Columbus, the greatest Democrat of them all. He left not knowing where he was going, and when he got there he did not know where he was. He returned not knowing where he had been, and did it all on someone else's money. \n\nThank you, \nHillary R. Clinton Monument Committee\n\nP.S. The Committee has raised $2.16 so far.",

He tells the pharmacist it's his first time and the pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex. At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all.\nThat night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents house and meets his girlfriend at the door. \"Oh, I'm so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!\"\nThe boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl's parents are seated.\nThe boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head. A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his head down.\n10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy.\nFinally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, \"I had no idea you were this religious.\"\nThe boy turns, and whispers back, \"I had no idea your father was the pharmacist!\"",

After they had been walking for a few minutes, they came upon a large dog. He was snarling loudly and biting and clawing at the cage.\"He looks like he'd be a pretty good attack dog,\" said the buyer.\"Well, he's not bad,\" replied the owner, \"but I have something better in mind for you.\"They continued walking around the premises, and after a while they found an even larger, meaner dog than the first. He snarled at the two men and tried to bite them through the wire on his cage.\"Ah,\" said the buyer, \"This must be the dog you were referring to earlier.\"\"Well, no.\" said the owner. \"I have something better in mind for you.\"The men continued their tour. Eventually, they came upon a fairly large dog that was lying quietly on his side, licking his butt. He did not seem to notice as the men approached.\"This is the dog I had in mind for you,\" said the owner. The buyer was flabbergasted. \"You're joking!\" he exclaimed.\"This dog seems quite tame; he doesn't act at all like an attack dog at all. Hell, he's just lying there, licking his butt!\"\"I know, I know,\" said the owner. \"But you see, he just ate a lawyer, and he's trying to get the taste out of his mouth.\"",

A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\" Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\" The man says, \"If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.\" The monks reply, \"You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.\" The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray- haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. \"In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.\" The monks reply, \"Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.\" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \"The sound is beyond that door.\" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, \"This is the last key to the last door.\" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound...\n\nBut, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",

The bride again says, \"Honey, the prisoner escaped again,\" to which the husband yelled, \"Hey, it's not a life sentence!!!\" ",

Shortly after they got captured by indigenous people and were taken to see the tribe's chieftain.\n\n\nChieftain (quite surprisingly knew how to speak English): \"Now ye gotta do whatever we tell ye to do or we will cut yer balls off, roast 'em and feed 'em to ye before beheading ye.\"\n\n\nThe three castaways were left with little choice but to obey to their abductors.\n\n\nChieftain (still in English): \"Now all three of ye must go in the jungle and bring me 100 of the same fruit.\"\n\n\nAnd so they went into the deep jungle, several hours after one of the castaways popped out of the jungle with a hundred oranges. The chieftain ordered him to put all the hundred oranges in his arsehole, but he should do it so without crying, screaming or letting any sound out of his mouth or he would meet a gruesome end.\n\nThe castaway began to put the oranges in his rump, but at the count of ten he could not sustain the heavy deserialization of his buttocks, and so he begged for mercy. The chieftain without hesitation relieved him of his nutsacks, roasted them, feed them to him before proceeding with cutting off his head.\n\n\nAfter even more hours, the second castaway came out of the jungle with a hundred gooseberries, and same stuff happened... The chieftain ordered him to put all the hundred gooseberries in his booty, but he should do it so without crying, screaming or letting any sound out of his mouth or he would meet an unorthodox end.\n\nAnd so the castaway began to fill his intestines with gooseberries... He did pretty well but reaching the 100th gooseberry he could not refrain himself from laughing out loud. \n\nThe chieftain, bemused: \"Why did ye messed up so close to the goal? Ye could have been free!\"\n\nThe castaway said: \"Sorry, I knew I was near from achieving the objective, but I just could not stop myself from laughing when I saw the other dude coming out of the jungle with a hundred watermelons!\"",

        "body": "\n\n\n So, there's a man crawling through the desert.\n\n He'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.\n\n He stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out\n and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.\n\n He thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon\n how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So,\n he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication\n later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give\n him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle\n in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the\n direction he thinks is right.\n\n He walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's\n been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and\n whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.\n\n He pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.\n\n By the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the\n town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.\n\n As it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things,\n he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.\n\n Full dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back\n up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.\n\n He wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.\n\n He knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.\n\n He rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in\n his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't\n find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.\n\n Then he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.\n\n Looking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.\n\n As he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.\n\n He decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait\n any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large\n rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly\n swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry\n and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes\n another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle.\n He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to\n make some difference and keep himself from passing out.\n\n He's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him,\n it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty\n sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.\n\n He walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills,\n dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water.\n Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.\n\n After a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat\n stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.\n\n After more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He\n knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing\n donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy\n enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if\n he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it,\n trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.\n\n He was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.\n\n He walks through the sand.\n\n After a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't\n remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he\n doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.\n\n But, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures\n that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from\n there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.\n\n Halfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third\n time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll\n just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.\n\n While crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally\n gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through\n the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert\n in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any\n rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape -\n shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.\n\n He finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top,\n he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees\n is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he\n sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more\n dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.\n\n Again, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper\n fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the\n cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from\n here. He's going to have to go down there and look.\n\n He puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune.\n After a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.\n\n He stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough\n energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When\n he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot\n in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.\n\n So, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins\n to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to\n have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages\n of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't\n have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last\n chance.\n\n He gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the\n dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting\n his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just\n keeps crawling.\n\n Finally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center,\n where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone\n area.\n\n His mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark\n stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun\n overhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying\n down on the nice cool surface.\n\n Cool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's\n probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and\n dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the\n beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him\n a drink. Then he'll know he's gone.\n\n He decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here\n in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the\n center before he goes. He keeps crawling.\n\n It's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's\n hearing. He would swear that someone just said, \"Greetings, traveler. You do\n not look well. Do you hear me?\"\n\n He stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and\n knees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something\n different - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few\n seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and\n tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands\n and tries again. Better this time.\n\n Yep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse\n of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or\n pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet\n out of the stone, at an angle.\n\n And wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and\n seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long\n desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.\n\n He stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and\n run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his\n final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to\n move from this spot.\n\n Well, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than\n dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a\n little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves\n it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a\n moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.\n\n Hmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet -\nthat was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.\n\n He then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here\n because he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was\n likely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was\n now on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had\n actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white\n post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe\n they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake\n was even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.\n\n He tries to clear his throat to say, \"Hello,\" but his throat is too dry. All\n that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going\n to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the\n bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out,\n almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't\n good. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes\n out.\n\n He gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips,\n and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then\n swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk\n now.\n\n He tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to\n spot the owner of this place, and croaks out, \"Hello? Is there anyone here?\"\n\n He hears, from his side, \"Greetings. What is it that you want?\"\n\n He turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed\n to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a\n speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides\n to try asking for help.\n\n \"Please,\" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, \"I'd love to not be\n thirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?\"\n\n Looking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was\n coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its\n mouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he\n falls forward, face first on the stone, \"Very well. Coming up.\"\n\n A piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits\n up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily\n disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the\n sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped\n around the tilted white post, still looking at him.\n\n He reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet.\n He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder\n again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes -\n they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been\n bitten. By the snake.\n\n \"It'll feel better in a minute.\" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He\n hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more\n importantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!\n\n \"Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the\n afterlife?\"\n\n \"Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,\" says the snake. \"That's the way I\n work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.\"\n\n \"You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a\n drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be\n thirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for\n the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk?\n Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?\"\n\n \"No,\" says the snake, \"I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I\n didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I\n bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just\n sitting around here.\"\n\n The man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the\n desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a\n snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not\n great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no\n longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt\n hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool\n stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer\n dying of thirst.\n\n \"I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your\n system with the next request,\" continued the snake. \"I can guess why you\n drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left\n in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or\n two, if you drank enough of it.\"\n\n \"Ummm, n-next request?\" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting\n shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.\n\n \"That's the way it works. If you like, that is,\" explained the snake. \"You\n get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish.\" The snake grinned at his\n own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.\n\n \"But there are rules,\" the snake continued. \"The first request is free. The\n second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of\n responsibility.\" The snake looks at the man seriously.\n\n \"By the way,\" the snake says suddenly, \"my name is Nathan. Old Nathan,\n Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound\n used to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand\n for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into\n names. You can call me Nate, if you wish.\" Again, the snake grinned. \"Sorry\n if I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds\n somewhat threatening.\" The snake give his rattle a little shake.\n\n \"Umm, my name is Jack,\" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. \"Jack\n Samson.\n\n \"Can I ask you a question?\" Jack says suddenly. \"What happened to the\n poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that?\n What do you mean by that's how you work?\"\n\n \"That's more than one question,\" grins Nate. \"But I'll still try to answer\n all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question.\" The snake's grin gets\n wider. \"Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need\n to drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not\n be thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make\n it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at\n all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to\n get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert.\n You've been changed.\n\n \"For the third question,\" Nate continues, \"you are still dying. Besides the\n effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal.\n In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years.\n Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is.\" Nate seemed vastly\n amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.\n\n \"As for the fourth question,\" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack\n could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read\n talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, \"first you have to agree\n to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell\n you.\"\n\n \"Wait,\" joked Jack, \"isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd\n have to kill me?\"\n\n \"I thought that was implied.\" Nate continued to look serious.\n\n \"Ummm...yeah.\" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was\n talking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a\n nasty temper. \"So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really\n stop the effects of the methanol?\" Jack thought for a second. \"And, what do\n you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper\n fluid, and just denature it?\"\n\n \"They may, I don't really know,\" said Nate. \"I haven't gotten out in a\n while. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and\n on that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you\n pulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume\n that they still color wiper fluid blue?\"\n\n \"Yeah, they do,\" said Jack.\n\n \"I figured,\" replied Nate. \"As for being bound by secrecy - with the\n fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me,\n this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you\n decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me,\n write about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will\n lead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of\n course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm\n guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding\n anyway, so you won't notice.\" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.\n\n Jack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a\n little nervous at this. \"Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know\n that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?\"\n\n Well, Jack,\" said Nate sadly, \"I can't tell you that, unless you make the\n second request.\" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.\n\n \"Umm, well, ok,\" said Jack, \"what is this about a second request? What can I\n ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?\"\n\n \"Sure!\" said Nate, brightening. \"You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes\n to yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and\n before you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or\n omnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous\n and yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and\n sort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be\n omniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very\n useful, at least in my opinion.\" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was\n staring at him.\n\n \"Well, anyway,\" continued Nate, \"I'd probably suggest giving you permanent\n good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be\n immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long\n time, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to\n recover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a\n request to me.\"\n\n \"Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?\" said Jack. \"And keep me healthy for a\n long time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request\n about a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not\n really a change to me?\"\n\n \"Right,\" nodded Nate.\n\n \"Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?\" Jack asked, hopefully.\n\n \"That takes two requests, Jack.\"\n\n \"Yeah, I figured so,\" said Jack. \"But I could ask to be a genius? I could\n become the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?\"\n\n \"Well, I could make you very smart,\" admitted Nate, \"but that wouldn't\n necessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you\n very athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either.\n You've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some\n truth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It\n all depends on what you decide to do with it.\"\n\n \"Hmmm,\" said Jack. \"Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request,\n after this one?\"\n\n \"Maybe,\" said Nate, \"it depends on what you decide then. There are more\n rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second\n request. You know how it goes.\" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had\n shoulders.\n\n \"Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent\n health doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially.\n Do I need to sign in blood or something?\"\n\n \"No,\" said Nate. \"Just hold out your hand. Or heel.\" Nate grinned. \"Or\n whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said,\n that's how it works - the poison, you know,\" Nate said apologetically.\n\n Jack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it\n didn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better\n about the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot\n snake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to\n be able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack\n tried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it\n wouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.\n\n \"Hey, Jack,\" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind\n him, \"is that someone else coming up over there?\"\n\n Jack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of\n nowhere? And did they bring food?\n\n Wait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...\n\n Jack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through\n his jeans...\n\n Jack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. \"I would have\n decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to\n hoodwink me like that.\"\n\n \"I've been doing this a long time, Jack,\" said Nate, confidently. \"You\n humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you -\n especially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of\n minutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the\n health benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now.\"\n\n \"Yeah, well, still,\" said Jack, \"it's the principle of the thing. And nobody\n likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or\n something instead?\"\n\n \"More meat in the typical human butt,\" replied Nate. \"And less chance you\n accidentally kick me or move at the last second.\"\n\n \"Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify\n to hear,\" answered Jack.\n\n \"Ok,\" said Nate. \"Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to\n just start talking?\"\n\n \"Just talk,\" said Jack. \"I'll sit here and try to not think about food.\"\n\n \"We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,\"\n answered Nate.\n\n \"Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!\" Jack jumped up.\n \"What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically\n whip up food along with your other powers?\" Jack was almost shouting with\n excitement. His stomach had been growling for hours.\n\n \"I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite\n it for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife,\n that is,\" replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to.\n\n \"Ugh,\" said Jack, sitting back down. \"I think I'll pass. I can last a little\n longer before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it\n is you find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw.\n No thanks. Just talk.\"\n\n \"Ok,\" replied Nate, still grinning. \"But I'd better hurry, before you start\n looking at me as food.\n\n Nate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued.\n \"You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden.\"\n\n Jack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate\n sceptically.\n\n \"Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack,\" said Nate. \"Stand up\n and look at the symbol on the rock here.\" Nate gestured around the dark\n stone they were both sitting on with his nose.\n\n Jack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a\n representation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around\n was coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches\n left the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it\n looked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and\n embedded in the stone than it did like a carving.\n\n Jack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the\n setting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the\n sky.\n\nWait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another\n night out here! Arrrgh!\n\n Jack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and\n stood next to Nate. \"In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate,\" said\n Jack. \"Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to\n have to head back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw\n desert critters for long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to.\"\n\n \"It's about 30 miles that way.\" Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail\n this time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to\n the way he'd been going when he was crawling here. \"But that's 30 miles by\n the way the crow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be\n able to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head\n out early tomorrow, Jack.\"\n\n Jack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and\n then sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading\n out right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting\n stuff. \"Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?\"\n\n \"Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway,\" said Nate. \"He\n figured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a\n 'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he\n could never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from\n across the ocean. He worried about that for a while.\"\n\n \"Garden of Eden, hunh?\" said Jack. \"How long have you been here, Nate?\"\n\n \"No idea, really,\" replied Nate. \"A long time. It never occurred to me to\n count years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I\n do remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands\n of years, at least.\"\n\n \"So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?\" said Jack.\n\n \"Beats me,\" said Nate. \"Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your\n kind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it\n could have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant\n requests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals.\"\n\n \"Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out\n of the stone there?\" asked Jack.\n\n \"Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much\n bigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember\n if it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But\n one day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do\n something for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've\n been here ever since.\n\n \"What is this place?\" said Jack. \"And what did he ask you to do?\"\n\n \"Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?\" Nate loosened his\n coils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into\n the stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to\n enter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned\n over and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as\n Jack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but\n Nate was suddenly there in the way.\n\n \"You can't touch that yet, Jack,\" said Nate.\n\n \"Why not?\" asked Jack.\n\n \"I haven't explained it to you yet,\" replied Nate.\n\n \"Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something,\" said Jack. \"You'd push it\n that way, and it would move in the slot.\"\n\n \"Yep, that's what it is,\" replied Nate.\n\n \"What does it do?\" asked Jack. \"End the world?\"\n\n \"Oh, no,\" said Nate. \"Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it\n 'The Lever of Doom'.\" For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing\n voice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and\n grinned.\n\n Jack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned\n Jack laughed. \"Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it\n really do?\"\n\n \"Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said,\" smirked Nate. \"I just thought\n the voice I used was funny, didn't you?\"\n\n Nate continued to grin.\n\n \"A lever to end humanity?\" asked Jack. \"What in the world is that for? Why\n would anyone need to end humanity?\"\n\n \"Well,\" replied Nate, \"I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment.\n Or maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really\n bad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are\n the rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I\n didn't think to ask back when I started here.\"\n\n \"Rules? What rules?\" asked Jack.\n\n \"The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it\n unless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human\n can be bound in that way at a time. That's it.\" explained Nate.\n\n Jack looked somewhat shocked. \"You mean that I could pull the lever now?\n You'd let me end humanity?\"\n\n \"Yep,\" replied Nate, \"if you want to.\" Nate looked at Jack carefully. \"Do\n you want to, Jack?\"\n\n \"Umm, no.\" said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. \"Why in\n the world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want\n that! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too,\n wouldn't it?\"\n\n \"Yep,\" replied Nate, \"being as he'd be human too.\"\n\n \"Has anyone ever seriously considered it?\" asked Nate. \"Any of those bound\n to secrecy, that is?\"\n\n \"Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or\n another. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and\n think, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get\n disgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while.\n But he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here.\" Nate grinned some more.\n\n Jack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at\n the same time. After a bit, he said, \"So this makes me the Judge of\n humanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?\"\n\n \"That seems to be it,\" agreed Nate.\n\n \"What kind of criteria do I use to decide?\" said Jack. \"How do I make this\n decision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are\n bad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?\"\n\n \"Nope,\" replied Nate. \"You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's\n up to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed\n to know.\"\n\n \"But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel\n horrible? Couldn't I make a mistake? How do I know that I won't screw up?\"\n protested Jack.\n\n Nate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. \"You don't. You just have to\n try your best, Jack.\"\n\n Jack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly\n getting dark, chewing on a fingernail.\n\n Suddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. \"Nate, was Samuel the\n one bound to this before me?\"\n\n \"Yep,\" replied Nate. \"He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to\n read and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried\n in the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months\n ago.\"\n\n**(CONTINUED IN COMMENTS)**",

I had left the campsite about an hour earlier and a terrible storm rolled in. The sky opened up and the ground was quickly saturated. I tried to continue my hike for another few minutes, but it got cold and I was chilled and soaked to the bone, so I decided to try to head back to camp.\n\n\nLightning was starting to crackle above me, so I thought I should try to take a shortcut to make my hike back quicker. I pulled out my compass and found my direction, but the rain made it impossible to see more than five feet in front of me.\n\n\nI was looking down at my compass, not paying any attention to where I was going, and suddenly felt weightless. The feeling didn't last long as I thumped down on slippery earth a second later.\n\n\nI had fallen onto a ledge on the side of a rather steep cliff, the bottom of which was at least fifty feet down.\n\n\nI sat there, contemplating on how to get back up this cliff as water rolled over the edge ten feet above me. There was nothing to grab onto to pull myself up. I was stuck there.\n\n\nAfter a few minutes, I noticed the little ledge I was standing on was slowly getting smaller. The water was coming down so hard it was eroding the tiny bit of safety I had.\n\n\nI dug through my pockets, thinking maybe I had something, anything, to help me out of my precarious situation. All I had was my compass, a cough drop, and a match. I was screwed.\n\n\nSo, I sat there, watching the edge of the ledge I was on get closer and closer to my feet, when suddenly I felt something pushing on my back.\nI turned slightly and saw a wooden box sticking out of the cliff behind me. It was working its way out of the side, the rain surely helping it along. I tried to move away from it, but the ledge wasn't very wide and the box kept coming out, pushing me farther to the weak and failing edge.\n\n\nAs more of the box came out, to my horror, I realized it was a coffin! I had no idea how old it was, but it looked rather rotten. All I could think of was being pushed off this ledge, and the rotten coffin breaking and dropping a skeleton onto my broken and battered body at the bottom.\n\n\nThe coffin crept closer, my foot began to slip. I grabbed onto a root that was sticking out of the cliff side and dug in my pocket once more.\n\n\nI hurriedly tore the wrapper off the cough drop and stuck it in my mouth.\n\nIt stopped the coffin.

As noted historian and sociologist Ian Ormwell stated, \"A joke cannot be taken at face value; all jests are subjective in their appearance and impact.\" Contrasting this view, the philosopher Ben Hoovian posited, \"All things being equal, a joke must remain in its proper context. A joke with no context is not a joke.\" The issue was finally settled by post-modernist Irma J. King, who unequivocally stated, \"It is the nature of humans to analyze, and all literature created should be subject to analysis.\" (For a more complete treatment on the subject I strongly recommend reading her seminal book \"6000 Years of Humor and Counting: Humor's influence on Human Civilization.\")\n\nAs for the original chicken joke, the most common interpretation would be to take the joke at face value: we are dealing with a \"real\" chicken and road. The humor of the joke is based on its simplicity: while most jokes rely on the extraordinary, the humor of this joke is based on the ordinary.\n\nOf course, one does not need to take the joke at face value. The chicken and the road can be viewed metaphorically. What if the chicken is a metaphorical coward, and is a human rather than an avian. The humor is then based not on the randomness of chicken desires, but becomes an example of cowardice and retreat.\nEven deeper, the road could be a metaphor for a dividing line, perhaps \"the other side\" is some kind of forbidden knowledge, perhaps even death. The simplicity of the joke reinforces the listener's ignorance; the joke raises more questions than answers. Sadly, we may never know. Obviously, more research is needed as to WHY the chicken crossed the road. But what kind of road is it? What kind of chicken is it? And if \"the other side\" is indeed death, what are the implications for our own existence?\n\nPlease review my sources for their veracity.

I don't mean to be rude there, but...\"*\n\nThe man smiles. *\"No, not at all. I get this all the time...*\n\n...Well, it started with the Gulf War. I was a young kid fresh out of high school, but I was poor. I needed money for college, and the Army looked like a good way out of the ghetto. But then they shipped me over to Kuwait. My platoon took some heavy fire during Desert Storm, and I was separated from them.\n\nI wandered the desert for days, with only the contents of my pack to sustain me. Sand. Sand was all I could think about. Everything else ceased to exist out there. I can only progress slowly, because I have to hide in my tent every time when even the smallest sandstorm comes around. I kept thinking, may be there are not just oases, nomads, and pompous cities in this desert. Supposedly there are ancient ruins as well. But until now now I only found lonely pillars scattered around the desert. Still my hopes were not disappointed, for now. I found a group of nomads, who were exceptionally friendly and hospitable. I decided to spend some time with them, before I set out again. Things went well, but I had nightmares on most nights. All the wandering in the desert must have exhausted me so much. I dreamt of large desert scorpion made of sand, some times it would be a large eagle chasing me into a big labyrinth.\n\nDuring one such sleepless night, I saw a mysterious man. Exhausted and wounded, was seeking refuge in our camp. Just before dying, he told me about a river whose waters bestow immortality on whoever drinks from it. The river is next to a place called the City of the Immortals. Determined to find it, I thanked my nomad friends and set out to find this City. \n\nThe days were uneventful, but the nights began to terrify me. I know that the majority of deserts are rife with life. But it is frightening to hear the sand move in the silence of night. And sometimes I found footprints in the morning near my tent, and they were definitively human. Maybe someone is just following, maybe one of the kids of one of my nomadic friends. But they grew in number the closer I got to the city, and they are always fresh. And I also suddenly heard quiet whispering one night, only heard when I almost fell asleep. I woke up from the nightmare to find myself tied up in a small recess on the side of a mountain inhabited by Troglodytes. I don't know how I got there, but I managed to free myself and I could see the City of the Immortals in the distance. I assumed I can walk towards it, but one Troglodyte was already following me. I had to run as fast as I could to get away from him. At last I reached the City of the Immortals.\n\nThe City of the Immortals is an immense labyrinth with dead-end passages, inverted stairways, and many chaotic architectural structures. I was Horrified and repulsed by the city, but decided to get inside, because the Troglodyte was chasing me. I eventually escaped the city only to find the Troglodyte waiting on the other side. I was exhausted. I didn't want to run anymore. I surrendered myself to him. To his will. But it turned out that he really was a Genie, and that the Troglodytes are the Immortals, having destroyed the original City of the Immortals and replaced it with the labyrinthine.\n\n'I am the Genie of the labyrinth' said the entity. 'For finding your way out of the labyrinth, I shall grant you three wishes. What is your first wish?'\n\nI was incredulous, of course. I deduced I must be hallucinating after all this running and exhaustion, and that this was desert madness. I decided to test the mirage. 'Alright,' I tasked it, 'I wish for a wallet with a million dollars in it, that I can never lose, and whenever I take any money out of it the sum is immediately replenished.'\n\n'Your wish is granted!' said the Genie. I felt a bulge in one of my uniform pockets. Reaching in, I pulled out a new wallet, stuffed to bursting with crisp, new bills. I counted them -- sure enough, it was a million dollars. I ripped up the bills, cast them to the winds, and threw the wallet as hard as I could. The moment it was beyond my sight, it teleported instantaneously back to my pocket, refilled with another million dollars.\n\n'What is you second wish?'\n\nI pondered the notion for a long moment, assessing my needs. 'Genie,' I said, 'for my second wish, I want to be transported to a cool, abandoned palace, into a harem room with a hundred beautiful young virgins who will all fall madly in love with me at first sight, before a buffet table set with a feast fit for a Persian king.'\n\n'Your wish is granted!' Poof! I found myself in a royal harem, escaped from the heat of the desert. All around me, nubile girls eyed me with keen interest. In front of me, every conceivable type of meat was roasted to perfect tenderness, set with all the appetizers, side-dishes, salads, soups, and desserts of the four corners of the globe.\n\nI dined until I was near-bloated, and then I had a lot of sex. I mean a lot. Several hours later, laying upon a bed of feathers, brown and blonde and red haired beauties nuzzling into me like puppies at their mother's underbelly, the Genie stood before me, looking down in satisfaction at his work so far.\n\n'What is your third wish?'\n\nI thought long and hard. Truly, this last wish tasked the very limits of my imagination, my beliefs, my ethics, my philosophy. Hours passed in silence, save for the gentle snoring of the ladies surrounding me.\n\nAt last, I spoke. 'Genie, for my third wish, I want a big Blue head.' \"",

Jim tried to sleep, but couldn't. \n\nAround midnight, he was snapped our of his thoughts when someone in the cellblock yelled \"TWELVE!\". Then, there was the sound of laughter reverberating around the building. He looked over to his cellmate who was laughing as well. Jim was surprised, but didn't make much of it. \n\nA little later, there was a shout of \"TWENTY NINE!\"! Again, the inmates in the block started to hoot in delight. Jim was intrigued and asked his cellmate, who was doubled over laughing, just what the heck was going on with the numbers. \n\n\"Well...\", said Jim's cellmate, \"...those numbers aren't random, man. The people in this block have been in here a long time, so long in fact, that we all know each other's jokes by heart. We numbered them so that they're easier to tell! You can shout out a number, and every inmate in this building will know what joke you're talking about!\"\n\n\"You're pulling my leg!\", said Jim. The cellmate chuckles and says, \"No, I'm not, man! Look, I'll show you. Give me a number.\" \n\nJim shrugs, \"Fine... How about 85?\". The cellmate goes to the bars of the cell and yells out \"EIGHTY FIVE!\". The whole block starts to howl out laughing. The cellmate looks at Jim and smirks. \n\nJim is astonished. \"Can I try?\", he asks. The cellmate beckons him to have at it. \n\nJim gets off his bed and goes over to the bars of the cell. \"FIFTY THREE!\", he yells. \n\nNo laughs, only silence. The cellmate says, \"Try again.\" \n\n\"SIX!\", Jim yells. Still no response. \"What happened? Did I choose the wrong jokes?\" \n\nJim's cellmate sighs, pats him on the back and says, \"It's not the jokes, buddy, you're just not telling them right.\"\n\n\n",

Where to go? He spent days choosing a destination, whether he would take the train or the plane, if there was something special to think about. The concept of being free for a time was new to him and he decided to let himself guide through the world by going on a cruise.\n\nThe big day finally comes and James is ready, he prepared everything that he put in a brand new suitcase he baught for the occasion. He takes the taxi to the harbour and stands in front of a gigantic ship, the size of a building, with as many windows. James wonders for a time how such a magestic piece of metal can swim, but his fears are gone as soon as he enters the line and gets ready to step on the monster.\n\nOnce in his cabin, James looks around him and realizes that this room looks like an hotel room and that everything seems as comfortable as any other room. Suddenly, he realizes he had to take an elevator to come here and that his position is comparable to being in the 10th floor of a house. \"I wonder what the view looks like\", he thinks.\n\nAs he opens the round window and passes his head outside, he can see his hometown from a point of view he had never seen. And looking down, all the people look like ants! Amongst them, James recognizes Richard, an old friend, and he starts calling him: \"Richard, Richard! Up there, I'm just here!\"\n\n\"Hey, James, what are you doing here?\"\n\n\"That's it, I take that vacation trip I talk you about, I'm going on a cruise!\"\n\n\"That's great, but why did you put a boat around your neck?\"\n",

The only problem was, the pig would just start crapping after a while and they could never get an accurate measurement of how much food its stomach would hold. So one of the scientists got the brilliant idea to stick a cork in the pig's butthole to stop it from crapping. The pig ate. And it ate. And it ate. Once it was absolutely full, it stopped eating, the scientists wrote down how much food they fed it and the study was over.\nNow came the trouble of taking the cork out. For obvious reasons, the scientists didn't want to risk doing this personally, so they decided they would send in a trained monkey to do it. They set up the monkey and stood back. 1 scientist stood 50 yards away, 1 scientist stood 100 yards away, and 1 scientist stood 150 yards away. Then the monkey pulled the cork.\nWell, there was a huge spray of crap. The scientist at 150 yards got crap all over his shoes. He was furious and he walked up to the scientist at 100 yards, who had crap all over his shoes and pants. The two furious scientists walked up to the third scientist at 50 yards and they saw him completely covered, head to toe, in crap. But he was laughing his freaking butt off and smiling.\n\"Why are you so happy?\" They asked him.\n\"I saw the monkey try to put the cork back in!\"",

He told her he couldn\u2019t stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor, she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. \n\n\nThe years went by and he continued to rip them out. Then one Christmas day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the bed covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. \n\n\nSometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bath room. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter.

        "body": "There were two young boys in a pet shop. One named Derek, and his older brother Patrick. They had been given money by their father to buy themselves two animals\u2014one for each of them. There was such a selection! Dogs, cats, caterpillars, giraffes, parrots, and more. They could only afford two of the smaller animals, and so they were browsing the section dedicated to these.\n\nFirst they looked at the birds. There were parrots. The boys had heard that they could speak, but when they tried to converse with them, the parrots neglected to do so in a way that satisfied the boys.\n\n\u201cHello, Mr Parrot. How are you doing on this fine afternoon?\u201d asked Derek, enthusiastic about the chance to see such a wonderful creature in action.\n\nThe parrot looked at him, and to Derek's disappointment, the parrot said \u201cFuck off, I'm trying to sleep you dickhead!\u201d\n\nThey moved on to the next creature which was the hamster. They watched them running around and fornicating, and as they were close with the Lord they knew that they could not associate themselves with something so foul.\n\nNext was a turtle. Both of the brothers were impressed with the sight of the turtle.\n\n\u201cThere is little chance of it running away!\u201d exclaimed Patrick, \u201cwe will never lose them!\u201d\n\nThe turtle was reading a book, and they were curious to know what it was that the turtle was into.\n\n\u201cI hope it's the Bible!\u201d said Derek, excitedly.\n\nBut as they looked at it closer they came to know that it was Harry Potter and as they were close with the Lord, they knew that they could not associate themselves with something so foul.\n\nBeside the cage that the turtle was kept in could be found a chicken. But as they were close with the Lord they knew that they could not associate themselves with something so fowl. \n\nThey searched and searched through the shop and there was nothing that wasn't recklessly rubbing the Lord's face in their own sexual deviance, engagement with the Occult, or being a chicken\u2014the greatest of all sins, committed by several of the pet shop's creatures, including the giraffe. They lamented this fact, for the giraffe appears such an innocent and sweet character! With its whiskers and tail. But alas! As the giraffe is also gravely guilty of \u201cbeing a chicken,\u201d in the Lord's eyes he is heathen and will perish the wrath of Satan.\n\nThey sought out an employee so that they might be freed of their woes. The employee was in the process of cleaning with a broom.\n\nThey said to the woman, \u201cCan you help us?\u201d\n\nShe turned to them and replied, \u201cFuck off, I'm trying to sweep you dickhead.\u201d\n\nThen she saw the sadness and pain in their eyes and the love of God touched her heart and she had a change of mind.\n\nShe said to the boys \u201cI will help you. What is it that you need?\u201d\n\nDerek asked of her, \u201cIs there any creature in this Pet Shop that is not heathen. Is there one among the animals that does not offend the Lord?\u201d\n\nAnd understanding the boys' woes she said to them, \u201cYes, there is one,\u201d and she led them to a small cage containing several beetles.\n\n\u201cHere you will find the weevil.\u201d\n\nAnd they marvelled at the small but innocent creature and they bought two of them and brought them home.\n\nBut their troubles were not over, for they could not tell which one should belong to whom. They decided that as Patrick was the oldest, he had a claim to the greatest of the two of them. But which was the greatest? Only a contest held between the weevils would decide the answer to this most glorious question. And so it began, the world's smallest Olympics; with few events instead of many, with beetles instead of humans, and with only two weevils from the same family, rather than a large portion of humans from many of the nations of Earth.\n\nThey decided that before they began the contest, they would name them. One of them would be called \u201cFermented Bovine Urine\u201d and the other would be \u201cGreg\u201d for these are the names that most please the Lord.\n\nThe first contest would determine which of the beetles was superior in strength. It would be a contest of who could lift the most pianos, for the family had many pianos, and lifting pianos would be a feat of strength indeed. The creature that went first would be Greg. Greg lifted one piano and was tired after doing so. But for he was of great determination he lifted a second. And then a third. After this he apologised to the boys and said that there was no more that he could do.\n\nFermented Bovine Urine went second and it clear from the beginning that he had little capacity to lift any piano whatsoever. He was saddened by his failure and wept, for he was of inferior strength.\n\nThe next competition was to determine how each of the weevils was with navigation. So they put each in turn into a maze of the boys' own construction. Greg, once again, was first, and he finished the maze within minutes.\n\nFermented Bovine Urine was the next contestant and he was less talented with navigation than Greg was, for he could not even make it past the first alligator-pit that had been installed. He wept once more that he was not capable of defeating Greg.\n\nThe next would determine their intelligence and so they were each given the same math problem.\n\n\u201cSurely\u201d exclaimed Fermented Bovine Urine, \u201cI can win this competition!\u201d\n\nBut whereas Greg managed to provide the correct answer, Fermented Bovine Urine had merely drawn pictures of boobies for half an hour, and numbered them so that the boys might know he can count.\n\nThe next competition would determine which of them had greater musical talent. They would both sing a song for the boys, accompanied by their mother on the piano, and the boys would know who could sing with superiority.\n\nGreg chose a piece of opera, and delivered with great competence. His voice was strong, his notes were on-pitch, his technique was at a professional level. Fermented Bovine Urine chose a punk-rock song and was disqualified.\n\nThe last and most important test was the competition to see who among the beetles was closest with the Lord. Greg stood up in front of the two boys and with no reference to the Holy Book, recited the entire Bible verbatim.\n\nFermented Bovine Urine felt the Lord in his heart, but whereas Greg was greatly dedicated to his relationship with Christ, he had spent little time on it. He instead read out select passages from Chad Kroeger's Wikipedia page.\n\nIt was now decided. Patrick was to own Greg, the greater of the weevils, and Derek was to own Fermented Bovine Urine. The two boys took each of the creatures to their rooms and put them in their individual cages.\n\nThe next day they started to notice a difference in each of their lives which they knew was directly caused by the introduction of the weevils into their homes. Derek, the owner of Fermented Bovine Urine had gone to school that day and had found that whereas in the past people would ignore him, they began to notice him and celebrate his existence. He had become a greatly popular boy at his school. Derek praised the Lord for his blessings and marvelled in the wonder of his Glory.\n\nAs the owner of Greg, Patrick's experience at school that day was different. Whereas in the past he had been ignored by his peers, now they would beat the living shit out of him and call him names. Patrick was enraged that his brother had been blessed and he had not, despite him owning the greater of the pets!\n\nHe cried out to the Lord, \u201cWhy, God? Why have you allowed me to suffer this way?\u201d\n\nBut the Lord was trolling Atheists on Reddit and did not hear him.\n\nThe next day Derek was given a gift by a generous neighbour which was a new bicycle. This bicycle was faster, easier to control and a far smoother ride than any he had ever experienced. He praised the Lord for his blessings and marvelled in the wonder of his Glory.\n\nPatrick's current bicycle got run over by a car whilst he was riding it and he was given several cuts and bruises and a completely broken spine.\n\nHe cried out to the Lord, \u201cWhy, God? Why have I been cursed so?\u201d\n\nBut the Lord was browsing Redtube and did not hear him.\n\nA week later Fermented Bovine Urine gave Derek a hug, and Derek was pleased for he knew that his life was filled with love and joy! He praised the Lord for his blessings and marvelled in the wonder of his glory.\n\nPatrick, though he could no longer move, asked Greg for a hug, but the beetle mistook his words and stabbed him with a used needle. He contracted aides, and cancer of the aides and was stoned to death for being a homosexual by the members of his church. \n\nIn his final moments he cried out to the Lord, \u201cWhy, God? Why have you blessed my brother so and cursed me when my weevil was greater?\u201d\n\nBut though the Lord could hear him, he was disinterested in Patrick and neglected him out of indifference.\n\nYou see, my children, there is a moral here. You must always choose the lesser of two weevils.",

Artie isn't the brightest bulb in the world, but he's always been there for Paul in the tough times. On October 5, 1953 Artie stood up for Paul against his bully in 7th grade.  Artie got his ass handed to him at that time, but so did Paul. That incident resulted in a life long friendship.  Paul and Artie went to the same High School together. They traveled around Europe that one summer in college. Artie was Paul's best man at his wedding. Everyone thought speech Artie gave was terrible, But Paul loved it Artie was his best friend.\n\nArtie's life wasn't much better either, he never had the smarts for that great Job.  In fact he was stuck in a dead end job as a construction labourer. Artie's car was pretty shitty too. Artie never married, but he was happy in the knowledge that at least he didn't end up with Paul's shitty wife.\n\nFor Paul's 46th birthday Artie was pretty broke, so all he could get his friend was a single lottery ticket. Artie being the sentimental guy that he was picked the date of the start of their friendship, and their respective ages (46, 45).  Paul loved the present, and thought that the two of them should go to the Legion that friday to split a round of beers and listen to them call out the numbers.  \n\nOn Friday they are both sitting there at the Legion having a laugh over a couple of beers when the cute lottery girl comes on the t.v. to read out the numbers.  Paul pulls out the ticket and spreads it out on the beer stained table in front of them.  The lottery girl starts reading out the numbers, 45, 10, 05.  Both of Paul and Artie's hearts start beating, thats 200$ already.  53, Holy crap thats like a 10, 000 ticket. They both start losing their shit. 46....... Paul feints.  He just won the jackpot. 37million dollars.  \n\nTwo minutes later Artie finally revives Paul. Paul and Artie celebrate the night away, buy round after round for the people at the Legion and get absolutely shittered. They close out the bar and as the ugly lights come on they stumble blitzed, singing, onto the street arm in arm with the winning lottery ticket in hand and start the long walk back to Paul's place.\n\nHalfway home, Paul comes to two drunken conclusions: 1. he has to share the winnings with his friend Artie 50/50, and 2. His bitch of a wife ain't gonna let that happen. Paul decides to share this epiphany with Artie and the two of them sit down to figure out this problem, and after about a half hour the only conclusion that they can come to is Paul's Wife has got to go.\n\nArtie being the good friend that he is tells Paul that he is willing to take care of the little problem himself, Artie never really liked Paul's wife anyway.  But Artie being the legal genius that he is wants to have some assurance that Paul is still gonna follow through his side of the plan and wants a contract. Paul agrees and pulls out the only piece of paper in his wallet, a one dollar bill and \"Pays\" Artie to off his wife.  And they come up with a plan.\n\n40 min later the 2 of them drunkenly stumble through Paul's front door only to find Paul's wife up in the living room. She immediatly starts yelling \"WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN?!\" \"WHY ARE YOU SO DRUNK?\"...... on and on she yells until finishes with \"WELL IF YOU TWO ARE SUCH GOOD BUDDYS THEN YOU CAN SLEEP TOGETHER FOR ALL I CARE!\" and slams the door to the bedroom.  They both look at each other, smirk, then immediately pass out on the couches.  \n\nThe next day Paul awakes to find Artie gone, Artie knows better then to be found on the couch by Paul's wife in the morning.  Paul wakes with the biggest hangover that he has EVER experienced, but Paul knows that this day is this is the first day of a new life for him. His wife of course is in her typical mood, but Paul placates her all day with \"yes, dear\", \"Of course, Dear\", \"I'll get right on it Dear.\" All the while feeling like crap.  That evening Paul puts his plan into motion and he begs his wife to go to the Safeway to pick up some pain killers and pepto for his still lingering hangover. Because he has been soo compliant all day his wife reluctantly goes. Little does she know this is the last shopping trip she will ever make. Paul quickly texts Artie \"It's a go\".\n\nWhile Paul's wife is shopping in the Safeway Artie sneaks into the back seat of Paul's wife's Car and waits for her.  When paul's wife finally gets done with the shopping and gets out to the car, Artie pops up from the hiding place and grabs her around the neck and starts choking her to death.  At one point Artie thinks to himself this is taking way longer then it does in the movies. All the while she is violently twitching and struggling in the front seat. Eventually she succumbs to the strength Artie built up over all those years of construction labour.  \n\nLittle does Artie know, but the store manager 35 year old Freddie has seen everything happen on the security cameras and has called the cops and ran outside to try to stop what Artie has done. Yet Freddie arrives just a little too late, in fact just as Artie is about to make his escape.\n\nArtie, realizing that he has been seen by this guy running towards the car knows that he has to do something to get away, so he sprints to Freddie and with one swing knocks him out. Artie then full of fear and panic gets on top of Freddie and chokes him to death as well.  Unfortunately for Artie and Paul this gives the police time to arrive and Arrest him.\n\nThe next day the paper lands on Paul's doorstep with the headline \"Artie Chokes two for a dollar at Safeway\" \n",

Women always maintain that giving birth is way more painful than a guy getting kicked in the nuts, but how could they know?\n\nWell, after another beer, and some more heavy deductive thinking, I have come up with an answer to that question. Getting kicked in the nuts is more painful than having a baby, and even though I obviously couldn't really know, here is the reason for my conclusion. A year or so after giving birth, a woman will often say, \"It might be nice to have another child.\"\n\nOn the other hand, you never hear a guy say, \"You know, I think I would like another kick in the nuts.\"\n\nI rest my case.

I've been so stressed at work, and to top it off the sitter quits on me one week before I'm supposed to take the wife and kids to Europe.  I don't know how I'm going to arrange for someone to take care of the pets and look after mom with only a week's notice.\"\n\nMike says, \"Hey, I'm not doing anything next week; let me take care of it for you!\"  Dave replies, \"That's real nice of you, and don't take this the wrong way... but the last time I asked you to do a favor for me you killed my goldfish.  This is a little more serious than 7th Grade, Mike.\"\n\nMike says, \"I know I've been a real fuck-up, but hear me out: I've turned over a new leaf.  I'm a different man now, Dave.  I have a steady job, a beautiful girlfriend... I only ever drink a little on the weekends.  Let me do you this favor to make up for all those years of being such a dope.\"\n\nDave says, \"I really don't like to do this, but I'm in a bind... so against my better judgment, the wife and I would be very appreciative if you would take care of things while we're away.  Thanks for coming through for me Mike.\"\n\nWhen he lands in Europe, the first thing Dave does is pick up the phone and dial Mike to see how things are going.  Mike says, \"Hey, how ya doin?! ... Listen, I'm really sorry big brother, but the cat is dead.\"\n\nDave says, \"WHAT?! JESUS CHRIST, I'M NOT EVEN GONE FOR A DAY AND YOU JUST KILLED THE FUCKING CAT! THE WIFE AND KIDS LOVE THAT CAT! WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL THEM?! You know the worst thing, Mike? You didn't even have the decency to let me enjoy my vacation for a single day.

I promise, I'm not going to let anything else interrupt the rest of your vacation.  I'll take care of everything and I bet I can even find a cat who looks just like snowball so you don't have to tell the girls anything.\"\n\nDave says, \"I'm sorry for being so harsh on you little brother.  If you can get me out of this, all is forgiven.  By the way, how's mom doing?\"\n\n[Short pause]\n\nMike says, \"Uhhhh, I think mom is on the roof.\"\n\nEdit: Punctuation",

He proceeded to talk up a storm. \n\nUpon his return to his office after the mass, he found the following note on the door: \n\n1. Sip the vodka, don't gulp. \n2. There are 10 commandments, not 12. \n3. There are 12 disciples, not 10. \n4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated. \n5. Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass. \n6. We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J.C. \n7. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy, Junior and the spook. \n8. David slew Goliath, he did not kick the s**t out of him. \n9. When David was hit by a rock and was knocked off his donkey, \ndon't say he was stoned off his a**. \n10. We do not refer to the cross as the \"Big T.\" \n11. When Jesus broke the bread at the last supper he said, \"Take \nthis and eat it for it is my body.\" He did not say \"Eat me\". \n12. The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the grub, Yeah God. \n13. Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at \nSt.Peter's not a peter pulling contest at St. Taffy's.\n",

She tells the salesman, \"I would like to buy a pair of pink curtains.\"\n  \n The salesman assures her that they have a large selection of pink curtains. He shows her several patterns, but the blonde seems to have a hard time choosing.\n  \n Finally she selects a lovely pink floral print. The salesman then asks what size curtains she needs.\n  \n The blonde promptly replies, \"Fifteen inches.\"\n  \n \"Fifteen inches?\" asked the salesman. \"That sounds very small - what room are they for?\"\n  \n The blonde tells him that they aren't for a room, but they are for her computer monitor.\n  \n The surprised salesman replies, \"But miss, computers do not need curtains!\"\n  \n The blond says, \"Hellllooooooooo! I've got Windoooooows!\"\n\n--------\n\nJack, a handsome man, walked into a sports bar around 9:58 pm.  He sat down next to this blonde at the bar and stared up at the TV... The 10:00 news was on. The news crew was covering a story of a man on a ledge of a large building preparing to jump.  The blonde looked at Jack and said,  \"Do you think he'll jump?\" Jack says, \"You know what, I bet he will.\"  The blonde replied, \"Well, I bet he won't.\"  Jack placed $30 on the bar and said, \"You're on!\"  \n\nJust as the blonde placed her money on the bar, the guy did a swan dive off of the building, falling to his death.  The blonde was very upset and handed her $30 to Jack, saying, \"Fair's fair... Here's your money.\"  Jack replied, \"I can't take your money, I saw this earlier on the 5 o'clock news and knew he would jump.  \n\n\"The blonde replies, \"I did too;  but I didn't think he'd do it again.\"\n Jack took the money...\n\n---------\n\nA blonde lady motorist was about two hours from San Diego when she was flagged down by a man whose truck had broken down. \n\nThe man walked up to the car and asked, \"Are you going to San Diego?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" answered the blonde, \"do you need a lift?\"\n\n\"Not for me. I'll be spending the next three hours fixing my truck. My problem is I've got two chimpanzees in the back which have to be taken to the San Diego Zoo. They're a bit stressed already so I don't want to keep them on the road all day. Could you possibly take them to the zoo for me? I'll give you $100 for your trouble.\" \n\n\"I'd be happy to,\" said the blonde. So the two chimpanzees were ushered into the back seat of the blonde's car and carefully strapped into their seat belts. Off they went. \n\nFive hours later, the truck driver was driving through the heart of San Diego when suddenly he was horrified!! There was the blonde walking down the street and holding hands with the two chimps, much to the amusement of a big crowd. \n\nWith a screech of brakes he pulled off the road and ran over to the blonde.\n\nWhat in the world are you doing here?\" he demanded. \"I gave you $100 to take these chimpanzees to the zoo.\" \n\n\"Yes, I know you did,\" said the blonde,\" but we had money left over -- so now we're going to Sea World.\"\n\n---------\n\nTwo blondes living in Oklahoma were sitting on a bench talking, and one blonde says to the other, 'Which do you think is farther away... Florida or the moon?'\n\nThe other blonde turns and says 'Helloooooooo, can you see Florida ???\n\n------\n\nA blonde pushes her BMW into a gas station. She tells the mechanic it died. After he works on it for a few minutes, it is idling smoothly. She says, 'What's the story?'\n\nHe replies, 'Just crap in the carburetor'\n\nShe asks, 'How often do I have to do that?'\n\n------\n\nA police officer stops a blonde for speeding and asks her very nicely if he could see her license.\n\nShe replied in a huff, 'I wish you guys would get your act together. Just yesterday you take away my license and then today you expect me to show it to you!'\n\n------\n\nThere's this blonde out for a walk. She comes to a river and sees another blonde on the opposite bank. 'Yoo-hoo!' she shouts, 'How can I get to the other side?'\n\nThe second blonde looks up the river then down the river and shouts back, 'You ARE on the other side.'\n\n------\n\nA gorgeous young redhead goes into the doctor's office and said that her body hurt wherever she touched it. 'Impossible!' says the doctor. 'Show me.'\n\nThe redhead took her finger, pushed on her left shoulder and screamed, then she pushed her elbow and screamed even more. She pushed her knee and screamed; likewise she pushed her ankle and screamed. Everywhere she touched made her scream.\n\nThe doctor said, 'You're not really a redhead, are you?\n\n'Well, no' she said, 'I'm actually a blonde.'\n\n'I thought so,' the doctor said. 'Your finger is broken.'\n\n------\n\nA highway patrolman pulled alongside a speeding car on the freeway. Glancing at the car, he was astounded to see that the blonde behind the wheel was knitting!\n\nRealizing that she was oblivious to his flashing lights and siren, the trooper cranked down his window, turned on his bullhorn and yelled, 'PULL OVER!'\n\n'NO!' the blonde yelled back, 'IT'S A SCARF!'\n\n------\n\nA Russian, an American, and a Blonde were talking one day.\n\nThe Russian said, 'We were the first in space!'\n\nThe American said, 'We were the first on the moon!'\n\nThe Blonde said, 'So what? We're going to be the first on the sun!'\n\nThe Russian and the American looked at each other and shook their heads. 'You can't land on the sun, you idiot! You'll burn up!' said the Russian.\n\nTo which the Blonde replied, 'We're not stupid, you know. We're going at night!'\n\n------\n\nA blonde was playing Trivial Pursuit one night. It was her turn. She rolled the dice and she landed on Science & Nature. Her question was, 'If you are in a vacuum and someone calls your name, can you hear it?'\n\nShe thought for a time and then asked, 'Is it on or off?'\n\n------\n\nA girl was visiting her blonde friend, who had acquired two new dogs, and asked her what their names were.\n\nThe blonde responded by saying that one was named Rolex and one was named Timex.\n\nHer friend said, 'Whoever heard of someone naming dogs like that?'\n\n'HELLLOOOOOOO......,' answered the blonde.

Jill felt sad and stopped going up the hill for water and instead chose to go to a lake nearby. Jack growing in the rich family turns into a douche and pretentious. One day he wanted to show his friend Jill that he was living well off without him. So he goes to Village invites Jill to come over to the city to visit him. So he shows Jill everything and taunts him how Jill cannot afford them. Later he goes to drop Jill in his Village. Jill then suggests they both should go to the well, just like their childhood. Jack agrees to that. They go to the well spend some time. After they start their journey back the well starts to speak. It says it was a wishing well all along and says it used to be happy every time they both used to come here and play. It says that wishing wells have a limit of wishes to give before they turn into a normal well. It offers the friends the last wish it has. Jack being a douche says to Jill \"I may not come to this bloody village again. I'll take the wish and will ask an iPhone for you for contacting me as it will take you a lifetime to buy one for yourself\". Jill gets hurt and as soon as Jack starts wishing Jill at the same time wishes \"I hope Jack disappears\" with tears in his eyes. Jill ends up with an iPhone7",

The foregoing notwithstanding, however, both parties stipulate that structural failure of the party of the second part (light bulb) may be incidental to the aforementioned failure to perform and in such case the party of the first part (lawyer) shall be held blameless for such structural failure insofar as the non-negotiable directional codicil (counter-clockwise) is observed by the party of the first part (lawyer) throughout.\n\n\nUpon reaching a point where the party of the second part (light bulb) becomes separated from the party of the third part ('receptacle'), the party of the first part shall have the option of disposing of the party of the second part (light bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable state, local, and federal statutes.\n\n\nOnce separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part (lawyer) shall have the option of beginning the installation of the party of the fourth part ('new light bulb'). This installation shall occur in a manner consistent with the reverse procedures described in step one of this self-same document, being careful to note that the rotation should occur in a clockwise direction, said direction also being non-negotiable and only until the party of the fourth part (new light bulb) becomes snug in the party of the third part (receptacle) and in fact actually becomes the party of the second part (light bulb).\n\n\nNB: The above described steps may be performed, at the option of the party of the first part (lawyer), by said party of the first part (lawyer), or by his or her heirs and assigns, or by any and all persons authorized by him or her to do so with the objective being to produce a level of illumination in the immediate vicinity of the aforementioned front (North) door consistent with maximization of ingress and revenue for the party of the fifth part, also known as 'The Firm'.\n",

No,\" said the executioner. \"I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.\"\n\nWell, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.\n\nThe switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.\n\nThe executioner was speechless.\n\nThe man looked at the executioner and said \"Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.

She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.\n\nThe next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her \"womanly\" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.\n\nBut the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.\n\nAnyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.",

Finally they get in and they start dancing and having fun, and she says to him, \"I'm hungry,\" so he goes to get her some food, but there's this huge buffet line. He gets her some food and they eat and they're dancing again and she says, \"Now I'm thirsty, can you get me a drink?\" So he goes to get her a drink and there's no punchline.\n",

(1. A billion dollars) (2. Half my estate) (or 3. My daughters hand in marriage). No one however has the guts to do so and the party ends and everyone goes home.\n\n\nThe very next year he throws another party's just like the first and at the very end he challenges someone to the same challenge as before. However no one has the guts the 2nd year either and everyone leaves.\n\n\nThe third year comes and he decides to throw one more party, and at the end of the party he gives his challenge one more time. Just as he is finishing saying what he will give the lucky guy who can swim across, He hears a splash of someone jumping in. He looks over to see this guy swimming as fast as he possibly can across the pool with the alligator chasing after him. Everyone in town is cheering him on as the alligator is snapping it's jaw at his feet. The man reaches the end of the pool and 3 men pull him up as the alligator snaps his shoe off.\n\n\nThe billionaire rushes over and he exclaims, 'THAT WAS THE BRAVESET THING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!!

I will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, please sit down. You are not to read any further unless you are sitting down, okay.\n\nWell then, I am getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out of the window of my dormitory when it caught fire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed by now. I only spent two weeks in the hospital and now I can see almost normally and only get those headaches once a day.\n\nFortunately, the fire in the dormitory and my jump was witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm, and he was the one who called the Fire Dept. and the ambulance. He also visited me at the hospital and since I had nowhere to live because of the burnt out dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment with him. It's really a basement room, but it's kind of cute. He is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to get married. We haven't set the exact date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy begins to show.\n\nYes, mother and dad, I am pregnant. I know how very much you are looking forward to being grandparents and I know you will welcome the baby and give it the same love and devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child. The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend has some minor infection which prevents us from passing our premarital blood tests and I carelessly caught it from him. This will soon clear up with the penicillin injections I am now taking daily.\n\nI know you will welcome him into the family with open arms. He is kind and although not well educated, he is ambitious. Although he is of a different race and religion than ours, I know that your oft-expressed tolerance will not permit you to be bothered by the fact that his skin color is somewhat darker than ours. I am sure you will love him as I do. His family background is good too, for I am told his father is an important gunbearer in the village in Africa from which he comes.\n\nNow that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you there was no dormitory fire; I did not have a concussion or a skull fracture; I was not in the hospital; I am not pregnant; I am not engaged. I do not have syphillis, and there is no Negro in my life. However, I am getting a D in sociology and an F in science; and I wanted you to see these marks in proper perspective.\n\nYour loving daughter, ",

Acting carefully, Joseph removed the splinter with his knife. After successfully removing it, the elephant looked at him and stomped its foot several times. Joseph stayed still, with the fear of imminent death. After stomping its foot, the elephant trumpeted loudly and walked away. Joe never forgot that day.\n\nThirty years later, Joseph was with his family at the Tulsa Zoo when an elephant walked up to Joseph's side of the enclosure and stomped its foot several times. Remembering the incident from thirty years ago, Joseph couldn't help but wonder if this was the same elephant.\n\nMustering all the courage he had, Joseph climbed over the fence and into the enclosure. He walked up to the elephant and held its gaze for several minutes before the elephant trumpeted. The elephant then wrapped its trunk around Joseph, picked him up, and then slammed him against the fence, killing him instantly.\n\nProbably wasn't the same elephant.",

Tell Walt and Elmer all you do before breakfast is smooth your cot, and shine some things. No hogs to slop, feed to pitch, mash to mix, wood to split, fire to lay. Practically nothing.\n\nMen got to shave but it is not so bad, there\u2019s warm water. Breakfast is strong on trimmings like fruit juice, cereal, eggs, bacon, etc., but kind of weak on chops, potatoes, ham, steak, fried eggplant, pie and other regular food, but tell Walt and Elmer you can always sit by the two city boys that live on coffee. Their food, plus yours, holds you until noon when you get fed again. It\u2019s no wonder these city boys can\u2019t walk much.\n\nWe go on \u201croute marches,\u201d which the platoon sergeant says are long walks to harden us. If he thinks so, it\u2019s not my place to tell him different. A \u201croute march\u201d is about as far as to our mailbox at home. Then the city guys get sore feet and we all ride back in trucks.\n\nThe sergeant is like a school teacher. He nags a lot. The Captain is like the school board. Majors and colonels just ride around and frown. They don\u2019t bother you none.\n\nThis next will kill Walt and Elmer with laughing. I keep getting medals for shooting. I don\u2019t know why. The bulls-eye is near as big as a chipmunk head and don\u2019t move, and it ain\u2019t shooting at you like the Higgett boys at home. All you got to do is lie there all comfortable and hit it. You don\u2019t even load your own cartridges. They come in boxes.\n\nThen we have what they call hand-to-hand combat training. You get to wrestle with them city boys. I have to be real careful though, they break real easy. It ain\u2019t like fighting with that ole bull at home. I\u2019m about the best they got in this except for that Tug Jordan from over in Silver Lake . I only beat him once.

Do you think I could stay the night?\u201d  \n\nThe monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you. You\u2019re not a monk.\u201d The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.  \n\nSome years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.  \n\nThe next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you. You\u2019re not a monk.\u201d\nThe man says, \u201cAll right, all right. I\u2019m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?\u201d  \n\nThe monks reply, \u201cYou must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.\u201d  \n\nThe man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, \u201cI have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.\u201d  \n\nThe monks reply, \u201cCongratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.\u201d The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \u201cThe sound is right behind that door.\u201d  \n\nThe man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, \u201cReal funny. May I have the key?\u201d The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.  \nThe man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.  \n\nHe demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.  \n\nSo it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.  \n\nFinally, the monks say, \u201cThis is the last key to the last door.\u201d The man is relieved to no end.  \n\nHe unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.  \n\nBut I can\u2019t tell you what it is because you\u2019re not a monk.",

So for his final project, his master set him this task: that he should destroy the city of Rome and scatter its inhabitants, by means of vegetation and foliage.\nThis task sounded quite difficult to the apprentice, and he told his master so; after some thought, the master decided that using the power of a talisman would not be cheating, and he gave the apprentice permission to use one. The master rummaged around in his storage shed for a while, and came up with a piece of deep red crystal about the size of a fist, obviously broken from a larger stone. \u201cThis is the last remaining fragment of the ancient Sumerian Amulet of Distress, which was used centuries ago by the magicians of Persia to defeat their enemies. It should be more than adequate to your task.\u201d\n\nThe apprentice thanked his master and retired to his rooms to begin preparations for the project. He packed many magical ingredients and sorcerous components: newt\u2019s eyes, dog\u2019s tongues, elf teeth, the hair of homniculi, powdered unicorn horn, dragon scales,  everything he thought he might need. He also packed his grimoires and books, his manuals and advisories, instruments and implements, parchment, ink, quills, chalk, candles, vials, a cauldron. He put on a bracelet that would allow him to contact his master telepathically should the need arise. He wrote out his plans in detail, using secret writing and codes to hide the meaning from prying eyes. He loaded it all onto his donkey and began the long journey to Rome.\nBut he forgot the talisman his master had given him. He forgot the last remaining fragment of the Sumerian Amulet of Distress. Unheeding of the danger, he set up camp near the Seven Hills and prepared his worksite. He started a fire, set up the cauldron and began filling it with ingredients. He chanted and sang. He gestured and danced. He used the entire force of his will and being toward the sole purpose of making the foliage and vegetation grow.\n\nAnd grow it did. Trees grew taller and bushier, and more menacing. Bushes spread and blocked the roads and highways. Weeds started to invade the aquaducts. Plants everywhere around Rome were growing out of control.\nNow, however, the apprentice reached the limit of his power. He had exhausted his own strength and had no more energy to exert. He collapsed in a heap by his campfire. He had overextended himself, used up his own life force in trying to keep the plants growing. He was dying now, and he touched the bracelet, reaching out to his master telepathically.\n\u201cMaster, what happened? I had everything ready, but the task was still too great. I have failed you and failed myself.\u201d\n\u201cMy son, are you sure you had everything ready? Everything?\u201d\n\u201cOh no \u2026 I forgot it and left it home \u2026 the Sumerian Distress Shard!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t leaf Rome without it.\u201d",

And Dot Com was a comely woman, large of breast, broad of shoulder and long of leg.  Indeed, she was often called Amazon Dot Com.\n \nAnd she said unto Abraham, her husband, \"Why dost thou travel so far from town to town with thy goods when thou canst trade without ever leaving thy tent?\"\n \nAnd Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, \"How, dear?\"\n \nAnd Dot replied, \"I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale, and they will reply telling you who hath the best price. The sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS).\"\n \nAbraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums.  And the drums rang out and were an immediate success.  Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever having to move from his tent.\n \nTo prevent neighboring countries from overhearing what the drums were saying, Dot devised a system that only she and the drummers knew.  It was known as Must Send Drum Over Sound (MSDOS), and she also developed a language to transmit ideas and pictures - Hebrew to the People (HTTP).\n \nAnd the young men did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung.  They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Sybarites, or NERDS.  And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums that no one noticed that the real riches were going to that enterprising drum dealer, Brother William of Gates, who bought off every drum maker in the land. Indeed he did insist on drums to be made that would work only with Brother Gates' drum heads and drumsticks.\n \nAnd Dot did say, \"Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others.\" And Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or eBay as it came to be known.  He said, \"We need a name that reflects what we are.\"\n \nAnd Dot replied, \"Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators.\"  \"YAHOO,\" said Abraham. And because it was Dot's idea, they named it YAHOO Dot Com.\n \nAbraham's cousin, Joshua, being the young Gregarious Energetic Educated Kid (GEEK) that he was, soon started using Dot's drums to locate things around the countryside.\n \nIt soon became known as God's Own Official Guide to Locating Everything (GOOGLE).\n \nThat is how it all began.

I came home from work early today and find her in bed, fully naked and somewhat sweaty.  She insists she was just tired and hot, but I know the truth so I search the apartment.  I search and search, and I just can't find the guy who's been plowing her.  I give up and go out on my balcony for some air and to clear my head, and there the son of a bitch is, hanging from the bottom railing!  I was so angry I just started punching and kicking him, but he had some death grip or something; he just wouldn't let go.  I take off my shoe and I start beating his hands with it, and he eventually drops.  In my rage at my wife and at the horrible mess that is my life, I grabbed my refrigerator and hurled it over the balcony as well.  I then had a heart attack and died from the over exertion.\n\nSaint Peter nods that this is indeed a horrible death, so the man is allowed to enter Heaven.\n\nThe second man:  I live on the 7th floor of an apartment building in Manhattan, and I was out on my balcony for some air and enjoying the view as I always do after work, but when I leaned against my railing it came loose and I fell.  I was able to grab on to the bottom railing of the balcony below mine, where I clung for dear life praying someone would come rescue me.  Eventually someone came, but to my dismay he started punching and kicking me.  I held on for as long as I could, but when he took off his shoe and started hitting my fingers I eventually fell.  Somehow I managed to land in some bushes and I was just stunned.

A battalion of troops, blitzing through northern Kuwait, discovers a string of boulders scattered across the desert landscape, the remains of an old fortress blown to bits by airstrikes. With some difficulty, the soldiers devise a means of getting their tanks across the treacherous pass.\n\nHowever, their general stops them right in their tracks. \"I have orders directly from the president! You are **not** to cross that stone wall, do you understand me?\"\n\nThe troops question why their advance has been halted, and so the general puts the president on the line. The troops hear the voice of George Bush emanate from the phone, saying \"You must not try to advance beyond that boulder, to do so would be a waste of our resources. It's the border, so just hold the line.\"\n\n\"But why?\", asks one young private. \"A simple boulder is no match for our forces. Surely you know that.\"\n\nGeorge Bush, President of the United States, responds into the phone:\n\n\"It's not just a boulder, it's Iraq.\"",

Having boned up on ornithology and traditional Chinese medicine, he decided that the answer was a prescription of gum-tree leaf tea. He gathered bushels of the tea leaves, brewed gallons of the tea, and poured it into the chicken for the two months. Meanwhile, Ming traveled all around China, praying at the shrines of his ancestors. One night he had a dream. His ancestors appeared and told him to feed the chicken tea made from gum-tree leaves!!! Ming, aware of his brother's lack of success, decided that the problem was quantity. He gathered whole CARTLOADS of leaves, and brewed BARRELS of the tea, and poured them into the chicken for the two months. At the end of the time, the poor chicken was still as naked as a bowling ball. Moral: All of Hing's courses, and all of Ming's kin; couldn't make gum tea refeather a hen!",

Field trips were pretty common at this aquarium; school buses full of children would swarm the turtle exhibit at least twice a week. One such day, this guy was tasked with walking through the aquarium making sure everything was in order for a big group of children coming from a local school. The dude was fairly new to the job, so he didn't really know what to expect. However, when he came across the dolphin exhibit he knew at once it wasn't \"safe\" for kids. Apparently, it was mating season for these dolphins, and they were going at it. The worker could barely watch them, and he could only imagine what would happen if the middle school kids decided to stop by this favorite exhibit. He went to his boss immediately and asked what he could do to stop the dolphins' poor behavior. The boss said, \"You know, this has happened before, and it's a real simple fix. I want you to go to the cliffs nearby and collect about two dozen baby sea gulls and feed 'em to the dolphins.\" Although shocked at the order to slaughter these gulls, this guy was a good worker. He went to the cliffs and started collecting these gulls. He got about twenty and decided he had enough. Collecting those gulls really wasn't easy, and he had a long walk to get back to aquarium on time. He turned back and starting briskly walking along the path to the aquarium. Twenty or so baby sea gulls in a bag slung across his back, this guy was eager to return and be done with the task. However, about halfway back, he came across an awful obstacle. A giant lion was just laying in the middle of the path. Fortunately, it was sleeping, and it didn't look like it was waking up. This guy was faced with a difficult decision. He couldn't go around it; the path wasn't wide enough. There was no way he was getting back to the aquarium without going over the beast. As terrified as he was to do it, the aquarium worker mustered up the courage to step over the lion. He took a deep breath and placed one foot over the lion, then the other. Immediately, he was arrested.\n\nBaffled, the guy look at the police, who were already putting handcuffs on him. The bag that contained the sea gulls was being searched. \"Wha- What did I do officer? What am I being arrested for?\", the worker managed. The officer looked him dead in the eyes and said:\n\nTaking young gulls across stayed lions for immoral porpoises. ",

And let me tell you they also appointed the local police-bear to watch out for any rule-breakers. \n\nStill, the rabbit is feeling a very hard urge to let go a few of his brown droplets in a secluded area. He knew that the fox did it and the bear didn't catch him so he had it going for him. Alas, the police-bear happened to be in the vicinity of the crime. He didn't see it happening but let me tell you he had a nose for these kind of things, he even caught a pair of birds shitting off of a tree branch.\n\nNow, the police-bear approaches the rabbit *\"Did you shit in the woods, rabbit?\"*\n\nThe rabbit quickly covers his misdoing with his hat. *\"No, sir, but as others might say, does the bear shit in the wood\"*\n\nRather angrily and not amused the police-bear answers *\"Don't play smartass with me, I saw you covering your shit with your hat\"*\n\n*\"But sir I mean it, I have not shat here. You see I was catching a butterfly, that's what I covered with my hat\"*\n\n*\"Then lift your hat\"*\n\n*\"No can do, it will fly away\"*\n\nThe police-bear thinks, this rabbit won't outfox him like the fox did earlier. He readies his pistol and shoots a couple of rounds at the hat. \"Now it won't fly away, lift your hat\"\n\n*\"Aye, sir\"* and the rabbit slowly raises the hat, and as the police bear sees the shit beneath, the rabbit exclaims in a high pitched voice:\n\n*\"**Fuck, bear, you shot the living crap out of it!**\"*",

Women on average are at a higher tendency to snatch children both premeditated and spur of the moment. Where as men usually only do spur of the moment. What this means is that you can more easily prevent men from kidnapping by taking the proper precautions when going out with your children, but women pre plan and are more likely to actually break into someone's house (84% of the time in the middle of the night) and successfully kidnap your child. In fact, a woman named Roly\u00e4t T'fiws, is a Swedish lady who is wanted in connection to a string of 22 different kidnappings across the country. She came here on a visa from Sweden and after her visa expired, she remained in the country on the run. It is believed that her kidnapping plans were started long before she came to America but she seemed like a kind enough lady that no one really questioned her intentions. And she is just one of hundreds of cases like this. Another woman has a very similar story \"Im\u00ebd \u00d3tavol\" was a girl from Norway who came over on a work visa and started working for a nanny business before she kidnapped 26 young children. The worst part is, both women got off on incredibly light sentences because the judge believed that \"these women are not capable of committing such crimes, just look at how sweet they look.\" \n\nHowever a young, colored male was just enjoying a day in his home when a small child ran in on him. In an attempt to return the child to its parents he took hold of the child and carried him toward them. Police arrived and without question shot the young colored man on sight. He was just trying to do the right thing. RIP Harambe.\n\nTL;DR: dicks out for Harambe.",

I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, \"You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me.\"\nI said, \"Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!\"\nWe went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go.\nShe chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table. We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.\nOn the way back to the office, Jane said, \"You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?\"\nI responded, \"I guess not. What do you have in mind?\" She said, \"Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.\"\nAfter arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, \"Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.\"\n\"Okay,\" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake.\nFollowed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing \"Happy birthday\".

Then, at 3:02, he shoves seven or eight M & Ms up his ass. \n\nA week later he comes back for his appointment. The doctor comes in with a thick medical book and looks at his watch. At 3:00 the doctor shoves a hot dog up the guy's ass. Then he waits. \n\nTwo minutes. Three minutes. Four minutes. \n\nAfter five minutes the tapeworm pokes its head out of the guy's ass and says, \"Hey! Where the hell are my M & Ms?\" \n\nAnd BAM! The doctor smashes the head of the tapeworm with the book.",

The change was subtle at first but before long the entire ocean was red as far as the eye could see. Adam knew he fucked up so he went into hiding.

It looks better than it did when you first created it.\" \"Thank you\" the Lord responded, \"It was no easy task. It took far less effort to create it than it did to fix it.\" Adam continued to Praise the work that had been done... \"This is the most magnificent sight I've ever laid my eyes upon! You sure can do some amazing things, Lord.\" \"Thank you my son.\" The Lord responded. \"I did what I could to make things normal again.\" \"Normal!? It looks better than new! what do you mean you did what you could? It seems to me that you made it better!\" The Lord shook his head as said \"It may look normal but I was unable to return everything to it's original state.

What do you want?\"\n\nThe man thought for a good long while. \"I'd like to be really lucky\" he replied finally.\n\n\"Damn that's a good one. Haven't heard that before. Have fun.\" The Genie replied, and with a click of his fingers, he was gone\"\n\nAstonished, the man wanted to go and test his luck. See if what he had just witness was real, or if he was turning mad. He walked into the nearest betting agency and started placing just stupid bets. To his surprise, he ended up \u00a3500 up. \n\nHe thought he would try his luck again, and went to the Greyhound races. He put in all the money he earned hours previously, plus more. Once he left, he was \u00a310,000 up. \n\nHe thought to himself \"I've never had much luck with women.\" so wondered over to the nearest whore house, which he was known to visit from time to time. As he entered the managers eyes lit up. \"You're never going to believe it\" the manager said while shaking him. \"What you've always wanted. She arrived this morning. Asian. 18 years old. Dead gorgeous. She's in the back room.\"\n\nThe man couldn't believe it, and slowly made his way to the back room. And there she was. \n\nJust minutes later the man may there exhausted. \"That was amazing!\" He said trying to catch his breath. \"But I must ask, why the Bindi?\"\n\n\"It's just for decoration really. You can take if off if you want.\" She replied with a smile. The man reached towards her forehead and lightly scratched it off with his finger.\n\n\"Holy shit!\" He said. \"I've won a car!\"",

        "body": "So, one time, I went to visit my grandparents in the small town of Victor, Montana. In the town of Victor, there is a church with a beautiful bell tower. There was only one problem though. The bell didn't ring. The townspeople were always late to church because they never knew when it started. In this town, there are only 30 residents, and so the mayor decided to call a town meeting. Everybody met in the mayor's room and started talking over all the possible solutions to this problem. Suddenly while everyone was talking, there was knock on the door. Everyone looked around the room. All 30 residents were gathered in this room, so who could this be? The mayor walked over to the door, and opened it, and standing there was a man with no arms and no legs. The man said, \"Hello. I heard about your bell problem, and I wanted to help you. I will ring the bell.\" Everyone wondered how he had heard of their problem, but ignored it as the mayor said, \"How will you ring the bell? You haven't any arms.\" The man smiled and said, \"Trust me.\" The mayor shrugged and the town followed as he carried the man up the stairs of the church and into the bell tower. He set the man down, and the man turned towards the bell and took a deep breath. The man hit the bell with his face, and it made a beautiful sound. The most beautiful sound you have ever head. It was like a choir of angels singing. The townspeople were amazed. The priest offered the man a deal. All the man had to do was ring the bell at 7 o'clock every morning, and he would be provided with a place to stay, food, and water. The man graciously agreed and the deal was set. I left the town of Victor, but reports have it that this deal kept lasting, and that the man rung the bell every morning, right at 7 o'clock. The townspeople were never late, and they were very happy. About a year after the strange man had joined the town, I returned to Victor. As I rose in the morning I realized it was 6:55. I watched the clock, getting ready for the man to ring the bell. But instead, at 7, I heard a smash, then what sounded like a scream and a loud splat. I raced out of bed, and ran outside. I ran toward the sound, which had been the church. As I approached the church, I saw a man, lying on the ground. I looked, and he had no arms and no legs. The priest came outside and gasped. The townspeople were in shock. We weren't even sure who the mutilated corpse was, but what looked like a he, with no arms or legs, was covered in glass. The priest came out and rolled him over. The priest sighed and said, \"Well, I never got his name, but his face sure does ring a bell.\"",

Your father read in the newspaper that most accidents happen 20 miles from home, so we moved 20 miles.\nWhen we moved here, I brought the house number from the old house so our address will remain the same here also.\nThis place is really nice.\nIt even has a washing machine above the toilet. I'm not sure it works because last week I put in 3 shirts and pulled the chain and haven't seen them since.\nThe weather here isn't too bad. It rained only twice last week. The first time it rained for 3 days and second time for 4 days.\nThe coat you wanted me to send you, your aunt Dolly said it will be a little too heavy with all the metal buttons to send by post mail, so we cut them off and put them in the pocket.\nYour father has a new job. He has 500 people under him. He is cutting grass at the grave yard.\nI took Violet to the club's poolside. The manager there is very cheeky. He told her 2-piece swimming suit is not allowed in the club. We were confused as to which piece should we remove?\nYour sister had a baby this morning. I haven't found out if it is a girl or boy, so I don't know if you are an Auntie or Uncle.\nYour uncle Peru, drowned when he fell in a big whisky tank at his work place. We cremated him and he burned for 3 days.\nYour best friend Morga, is no more. He died trying to fulfill his father's last wishes. His father had wished to be buried at sea after he died. And your friend died while in the process of digging a grave for his father.\nThere isn't much more news this time. Nothing much has happened.\nP.S: Son, I was going to send you some money but by the time I realised, I had already sealed off this letter.",

Schitt. Awe Schitt, the fertilizer magnate, married O. Schitt, a partner of Kneedeep &. Schitt Inc. \n\nIn turn, Jack Schitt married Noe Schitt, and the deeply religious couple produced 6 children: Holie Schitt, Fulla Schitt, Giva Schitt, Bull Schitt, and the twins: Deep Schitt and Dip Schitt. \n\nAgainst her parents' objections, Deep Schitt married Dumb Schitt, a high school drop out. After being married 15 years, Jack and Noe Schitt divorced. \n\nNoe Schitt later married Mr. Sherlock, and because her kids were living with them she wanted to keep her previous name. She was known as Noe Schitt-Sherlock. \n\nDip Schitt married Loda Schitt and they produced a nervous son, Chicken Schitt. \n\nFulla Schitt and Giva Schitt were inseparable throughout childhood and subsequently married the Happens brothers in a dual ceremony. The wedding announcement in the newspaper announced the Schitt-Happens wedding. \n\nThe Schitt-Happens children were Dawg, Byrd, and Hoarse. Bull Schitt, the prodigal son, left home to tour the world. He recently returned from Italy with his new bride, Piza Schitt. \n\nSo now if someone says, \"You don't know Jack Schitt\", you can correct them. Not only do you know Jack, you know his whole family. \n\nTo which I replied: \n\n\"Actually, Jack Schitt is a character in Jasper Fforde's Eyre Affair and Lost in a Good Book. So I can proudly say I knew Jack before you knew Schitt.\"",

The bouncer asked \"What is your costume?\" The first man said \"I'm anger.\" He was let in\n\nThe second man found a bucket of blue paint. He covered his whole body in blue paint, and walked up to the bouncer. The bouncer asked \"What's your costume?\" The second man replied \"I'm sadness.\" He was also let in.\n\nThe third man found an old, rotten pear in the trash can. He couldn't find anything else worthy of putting on his body, so he jammed his dick into the pear. Confidently, he walked up to the bouncer.\n\nThe bouncer was disgusted. \"What the hell is your costume supposed to be?!\" He exclaimed.\n\nThe third man replied \"Don't you see? I'm fucking despair.\"",

We seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so we're not sure what to do with you.\"\n\n\"No problem, just let me in,\" says Hillary Clinton. \n\n\"Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from the higher ups. What we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity.\"\n\n\"Really?, I've made up my mind. I want to be in heaven,\" says Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but we have our rules.\"\n\nAnd with that, St. Peter escorts her to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell.\n\nThe doors open and she finds herself in the middle of a green golf course. In the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all her friends and other politicians who had worked with her.\n\nEveryone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet her, shake her hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the expense of the people.\n\nThey played a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster, caviar and the finest champagne.\n\nAlso present is the devil, who really is a very friendly guy who is having a good time dancing and telling jokes.\n\nThey are all having such a good time that before Hillary Clinton realizes it, it is time to go.\n\nEveryone gives her a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises.\n\nThe elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens in heaven where St. Peter is waiting for her, \"Now it's time to visit heaven...\n\nSo, 24 hours passed with that Hillary Clinton joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time and, before she realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns.\n\n\"Well, then, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. Now choose your eternity.\"\n\nClinton reflects for a minute, then answers: \"I'll choose heaven.\n\nThe devil is shocked and says,\"Why would you choose heaven over hell?

While browsing through the old woman's shelves of potions and totems, he noticed a large dildo sitting in the back. He asked the old woman, \"What is this dildo doing here?\"\n\nThe old woman smiled. \"That is no ordinary dildo. That is a voodoo dildo!\"\n\nThe old woman explained to the man that the dildo was possessed by the spirit of a legendary lover and told him that the dildo would obey any sexual command that was said to it.\n\nThe man thought it would be the perfect gift for his lonely wife and purchased it. The gypsy wrote down the instructions for the voodoo dildo on a card and the man took it home with him.\n\nWhen the man got home, he waiting until he was about to go on another trip before presenting his wife with his present. He explained what it was and showed her the card about how to use it. He kissed her good-bye and left knowing that his wife would be taken care of while he was gone.\n\nAfter a day or two, the wife was very lonely and decided to give the gift a try. Se undressed, took the voodoo dildo out of its box, and looked at the card. She then said the magic words... \"Voodoo Dildo my pussy!\"\n\nThe Voodoo Dildo went to work and pleasured the woman for hours and hours. After a while, she couldn't take anymore and reached for the instruction card to see how to get her present to stop. In her haste, however, she knocked the card off the bed and it drifted into the fireplace. The woman watched in horror as the card burned to ashes.\n\nThe woman tried several commands: \"Stop! Cease! Quit! Abort!\" but nothing would stop the voodoo dildo. Thankfully, the address of the gypsy woman was on the box the dildo had come in and, after throwing on some clothing, the woman got in the car and sped away.\n\nShe was a few miles down the highway when she was pulled over by a highway patrol officer.

There's a sheepish knock at the door. \"Come in,\" the man says without lifting his eyes from the page. \n\nThe door creaks slowly and a young man, no more than 17 with his face long and his eyes wet and red, slips silently into the room. His sock-muffled steps are barely whispers on the wooden floor. \"Dad?\" his voice weak and unsure, \"can we talk?\"\n\nWith his son standing by his side, his eyes are finally pulled from the page. The anguish in his son's voice is enough to tear him from the fictitious world where he finds comfort and respite. \"Of course,\" he says, placing his bookmark and closing the tome on his lap, \"what's wrong?\"\n\nThe boy chokes back a sob and gathers his thoughts, his father waits patiently. \"Wh...\" he clears his throat, \"Why are girls so mean?\"\n\nA subtle smile contorts his father's face and a gentle nod says \"I knew this would come. Someday.\" \n\nHis father breathes deep and stares at the velvety ripples across his favorite drink. He reaches, and gently lifts the cup to his son. \"Have a sip.\"\n\nThe boy smells first, as his father does at dinner, then sips. \"Bleh!\" He exclaims, \"how do you drink that!?\"\n\nThe father chuckles and accepts the cup yet again.\n\n\"Son, women are like wine.\" He takes another drink, slightly more than a sip. \"Like this wine, the girls you are dating now are too young. All of their off flavors haven't had time to settle. Their brash, even obnoxious, they insist upon themselves and are unrefined. Sure, they may get you to where you want to go, but you'll wake up regretting everything and feeling sick.\" \n\nThe boy just nods.\n\n\"As the wine ages, all those off flavors settle down, the tannins soften and rough edges become soft and welcoming. The same wine, which would have given you a headache if enjoyed too early, makes the perfect partner for your dinner or just to be enjoyed on it's own.\"\n\n\"Thanks dad, i think....\"\n\n\"But then, the wine continues to age,\" he continues cutting off the boy, \"and all of the fruit character that once defined it is lost. The flavors become flabby and the alcohol turns to vinegar. Soon, all of the inside crystallizes leaving nothing but a sour, bitter, acrid slurry that makes you want to vomit as soon as it touches your lips.\" The father then downs the remainder of his wine in one loud gulp.\n\nThe boys stares horrified at his father, \"When does that happen?\"\n\n\"I dunno,\" he says while pouring another glass. \"How old is your mother?\"  \n",

We seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so we're not sure what to do with you.\"\n\n\"No problem, just let me in,\" says Hillary Clinton. \n\n\"Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from the higher ups. What we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity.\"\n\n\"Really?, I've made up my mind. I want to be in heaven,\" says Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but we have our rules.\"\n\nAnd with that, St. Peter escorts her to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell.\n\nThe doors open and she finds herself  in the middle of a green golf course. In the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all her friends and other politicians who had worked with her.\n\nEveryone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet her, shake her hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the expense of the people.\n\nThey played a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster, caviar and the finest champagne.\n\nAlso present is the devil, who really is a very friendly guy who is having a good time dancing and telling jokes.\n\nThey are all having such a good time that before Hillary Clinton realizes it, it is time to go.\n\nEveryone gives her a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises.\n\n The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens in heaven where St. Peter is waiting for her, \"Now it's time to visit heaven...\n\nSo, 24 hours passed with that Hillary Clinton joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time and, before she realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns.\n\n \"Well, then, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. Now choose your eternity.\"\n\nClinton reflects for a minute, then answers: \"Well, I would never have said it, I mean heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better off in hell.\"\n\nSo, Saint Peter escorts her to the elevator and she goes down, down, down to Hell. \n\nNow the doors of the elevator open and she is in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. She sees all of her friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags. The devil comes over to her and grins menacingly. \n\n\"I don't understand,\" stammer Hilary. \"Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and a club and we ate lobster and caviar and danced and had a great time. Now all there is is a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable.\"\n\nThe devil looks at Hilary, smiles and says,\n\n\"Yesterday we were campaigning. Today you voted for us!\"",

What was that?!'\nSo she says the words that every boyfriend on the planet dreads to hear...\n'You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.'\nShe responded to my puzzled look by saying, 'Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?'\nRealizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.\nThe very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big unnamed department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said, 'Lets get a pair for each outfit.'\nWe went on to the jewelry department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings. Let me tell you... she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis.\nI think I threw her for a loop when I said, 'That's fine, honey.' She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation, she finally said, 'I think this is all dear, let's go to the cashier.'\nI could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, 'No honey, I don't feel like it.'\nHer face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, 'WHAT?'\nI then said, 'Honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You're just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.'\nAnd just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, 'Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?'\nApparently I'm not having sex tonight.",

        "body": "There was once a priest who went to see the world after taking his oath. After many years of wandering, he finally arrived in a small village in the middle of nowhere. The people there believed in the same religion as he did, but they had no church; they had to go to the nearest one which was in a small town 25 km's from there. The priest took the initiative, asked the Church for support, and with the help of the local men they built their own temple. From there on, he was celebrating the Sunday masses, joining together men and women in Holy Matrimony, and saying prayers at the funerals.\n\nMany years passed by like that.\n\nAt the end of an ordinary mass, in early spring, on a chilly Sunday morning he was just guiding the people out of the church, was about to close the gates when an unknown man stepped into the churchyard.\n\nWith his dirty and torn clothes, he stood before the priest and said:\n\n- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was a good man, and even though he thought the request was a bit strange, he went back to the rectory, took out a lemon, cut it in half, took it back to the man and gave it to him, who looked back to the priest with gratitude. However, the priest was curious. He asked:\n\n- Son, why do you need this half of a lemon? - with a fright on his face, and before the priest could have said a thing, he rushed out of the churchyard gate and took off.\n\nA week later, around the same time, when the priest was leaving the church, he found himself in front of the same man in the churchyard. The man said:\n\n- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was surprised by the appearance of the man and his strange request. Of course he was good, went back to the rectory, and brought the half lemon. Placed it in the stranger's hand and immediately he asked:\n\n- Here it is, my dear son, but please tell me why do you need this half a lemon? - the man was obviously frightened and immediately ran away but the priest was not sluggish either and ran after him. He wasn't in a very good condition, he has never run so much and so fast before so he was out of breath by the end of the village, almost fainted. He thought the strange man might appear again next week, and it would be nice if he could keep up with him, so he spent his week working on his cardio. It turned out to be a good idea, because as he thought, the stranger entered the churchyard on Sunday. The priest didn't even wait for the request, he was good, and brought the half lemon. He received these words from the man:\n\n- Thank you priest for being so good and giving me half a lemon.\n\n- Don't mention it son, -said the priest- but please tell me, what do you need it for?! - by the time he finished his sentence the man was already running, but the priest was close behind. They were running for a while and the priest was starting to feel exhausted when they arrived at a wide and swift river. The stranger without thinking threw himself into the river and swam across the river and disappeared on the other side. The priest didn't follow because he couldn't swim. He was annoyed when he got home. He spent the next week learning to swim at the swimming pool in the small town 25 km's away. He was anxiously waiting for the next Sunday; now he was sure that the weird fellow would visit again. On Sunday, as he was closing the church, the gate creaked, and entered the man:\n\n- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was good, went back, put on his swimming trunks, his running shoes, grabbed half of the lemon and took it to the stranger:\n\n- Here it is, my son, but please tell me already, why do you need it? - the guy was terrified, rushed out the gate with the priest following. Reached the river, swam across, the priest right behind him. He kept running on the other side of the river and the priest was still on his tail. They kept running until they got to a tall tree on the verge of a deep ravine. The man climbed the tree with the agility of a cat, the priest not knowing how to climb a tree, stood on the ground. He was cursing everything as he walked back home. The following week the villagers watched as the priest in the garden of the church climbs trees, jumping back and forth, and generally behaving very strangely. The priest didn't care, he was exercising obsessively, preparing himself for the meeting. On Sunday before the mass, he put on his trunks and running shoes under his cassock. In fact, he was good and put half a lemon in his pocket in advance. The mass finished much earlier than usually, and he emptied the church as soon as possible so he could warm up. In the same exact time the mass should have ended, the strange man entered the churchyard.\n\n- Priest, please be good... - the priest was already handing him half of a lemon, and asked:\n\n- Son, why do you need it for God's sake? - the man ran away terrified, the priest followed him. They ran to the river, swam across, ran to the tree, climbed up. The priest almost catched the stranger when he grabbed a vine and swung to the other side of the ravine. The priest was about to have a stroke, but then he saw another vine. Whoop, he grabbed it and swung across. There, however, he encountered an unexpected obstacle: it was a plane graveyard and the man closed himself in one of the wreckages. The priest was raging as he walked around the wreckage several times, but he found no entrance except for the sealed door on the side of the plane; he had to open it somehow. He was furious but he went home. He spent every day at the village's locksmith and learned every possible way of opening a lock. On Sunday he held the mass in his swimming trunks, running shoes, on his back in a waterproof backpack was a crowbar, a cutting torch, a wrench and a drill, then he stood in front of the church and waited for the man. He was there on time.\n\n- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon!\n\n- There you go, son - handing him the lemon, because he was good, but in the same time he grabbed the stranger's arm, pulled him close, and with obsession in his eyes, asked:\n\n- But what do you need it for?! - panic came over the man as he made his escape from the priest's hands and ran away, but the priest was very close behind. Racing to the river they quickly got across, running up the tree almost breaking their necks, one after the other swung across the ravine, the man barely managed to close the door of the wreckege in the priest's face. Little did he know that the priest would not stop there, because he grabbed his backpack and started working on the lock with his tools. In less than an hour the heavy door creaked open. Inside, the stranger was shivering in horror, he was afraid of the priest's fierce and triumphant look. The priest slowly strode up to the man, crouched down, and very quietly, with a friendly smile on his face, gently asked:\n\n- Son. You have been asking for half a lemon for the last few weeks. I'm very happy to give it to you, even in the future, I am only asking in return that you tell me: why do you need it?\n\n- All right, priest ... - came the answer in a trembling tone - I will answer your question, but please, be good, and do not tell anyone.\n\nThe priest was good, and never told anyone.",

I live on the 25th floor you see and when I got home I could tell something was up so I searched and searched and searched and finally found the guy that was doing my wife hanging from my balcony, trying to swing himself onto the 24th floors balcony.

He did manage to land in some tree branches though so still in my moment of rage, I went and grabbed the fridge and threw it over the balcony... Due to the rage and stress of this, my heart gave out and here I am...\"\n\n\nThe Judge took in the story - cross-checked the first mans file, taking note of a few things and then informed the man that what he did was pretty severe and that he wasn't going to allow him into Heaven for assessment due to it.

Somehow though, I managed to grab onto the railing of the balcony of what I presume was the 25th floor. I began to swing myself to try get onto the 24th floor balcony when some moron came running out and stomped on my hands until I fell. Luck was on my side again though because I ended up landing in some tree branches and not to my death. However that was short lived because next thing I know a fridge falls on top of me, crushing me instantly and here I am...\"\n\n\nThe Judge took in the story - cross-checked the second mans file, taking note of a few things and then informed the man that he led a good life and that he was going to be allowed through the gates to Heaven for assessment or he could opt to be reincarnated as something of his choosing, so long as it was realistic/within the boundaries of the goodness/life he lived and wasn't outrageous or farfetched.

I have a can down in the cellar. Go in the back, undo the lock, open the trap door, go down the thirty-seven flights of stairs, and you'll find it next to the cage. But whatever you do, *don't touch the golden monkey in the cage*!\"\n\nThankful, the man proceeds into the back, undoes the lock, opens the trap door, goes down the thirty-seven flights of stairs, and looks around the cellar. Sure enough, there's a gas can on the floor, next to a large cage containing a golden monkey. It sits on a stool, ignoring him as he retrieves the gas can and starts up the thirty-seven flights of stairs to his car.\n\nThe man fills up his tank, thanks the farmer, and goes to replace the gas can. He heads into the back, through the trap door, down the thirty-seven flights of stairs, and sets down the can. The golden monkey pays him no mind, and he goes on his way.\n\nHalfway up the stairs, the man stops. He turns around, goes back down eighteen flights of stairs, and goes to the cage. \"Hello?\" he says to the monkey. The golden monkey ignores him. Slowly, he reaches out, putting his hand through the bars. The monkey doesn't move. Gently, he touches the monkey on the arm.\n\nThe man recoils as the golden monkey goes wild. It starts screaming and thrashing, clawing at him through the cage. Panicked, the man turns to run, but as he does, he hears the monkey break the bars of its cage. He barrels up the thirty seven flights of stairs as fast as he can, hearing the monkey speed after him, roaring. He reaches the top and slams down the cellar door, locks it, and makes a mad dash for his car. Behind him, the cellar door shatters as the monkey rips through it. \n\nHe manages to make it to his car and jumps inside, peeling out as fast as he can. The monkey is right behind him, and before he can get up to speed, it leaps onto the top of the car. Howling, screaming, it beats at the roof of the car. The man floors it and steers wildly, but the monkey will not be dislodged. With a roar, it punches a hole through the roof and peels back the metal. The man slams the breaks, but the monkey will not be dislodged. Crying, the man braces himself. The monkey reaches in and taps him on the shoulder. \"Tag, you're it!\"",

She simply could not bear the thought of being away from Mittens for a couple of months while they go and visit all the places in the world that they hadn't seen before.\n\nBeing wealthy, the husband came up with a plan. He employed a butler and made sure that the good man was a cat lover and instructed him to spend as much time as possible with Mittens to gain its trust. James the butler soon settled into the household and despite quite obviously not being the most intelligent, he performed his duties very well and did his part to give Mittens lots of attention and treats so that before too long the cat was quite fond of him.\n\nEventually the husband approached his wife and broached the subject of the two of them going on their long awaited world tour. At first the wife wouldn't hear a word of it, but he kept pointing out to her how fond Mittens had become of James and how attentive he was to the cat and telling her that James could phone them every morning and evening with a report on Mittens' well-being. Eventually he wore her down and she agreed that they could go on the trip.\n\nFor weeks before they were due to set off the wife drove James crazy with lists of instructions on how he should take care of Mittens, with daily schedules, when and how she should receive her favourite treats, down to the last detail.\n\nFinally the day of their departure arrived. Just before they were about to leave the husband called James aside and said to him: Now remember, James, madam is extremely fond of Mittens, so you must please do your utmost to keep Mittens safe and happy. But please, just in case - heaven forbid - Mittens does pass away while we are away - Mittens is quite an old kitty by now after all - please, please don't just phone us and tell us that Mittens has died, because it will be the end of our trip and ruin our holiday that I have waited for so long. Rather, what you must do when you phone is to say, \"Mittens is on the roof, and she won't come down\", then I will know what has happened and I will slowly over the next few days prepare my wife and try and finish off our holiday as quickly as possible without completely ruining it. Do you understand, James?\n\nTo the husband's huge relief James confirmed: Yes sir, I understand, if Mittens dies, I must phone and say \"Mittens is on the roof and she won't come down\", and you will know what's happened.\n\nAt long last they set off on their long awaited trip. They visited every place that they had ever only seen in movies and books and travelled from country to country, visiting all the tourist sites, throughout Europe, across the Middle East, throughout Asia; they even went on safari in Africa. They were having a wonderful time. Twice a day James would phone and confirm that all was well with Mittens and the wife found that despite all her fears she was actually enjoying the trip.\n\nUntil one morning, when the phone rang as usual. \n\nAs usual the wife rushed to the phone to get the latest news of her beloved Mittens.\n\nSure enough, it was James calling, to tell her, \"Madam, your mother is on the roof and she won't come down.\"\n",

He didn\u2019t have many animals, but he did have two he loved immensely: his dog Spot, and his prize winning race horse, the fastest horse ever to run in the Kentucky Derby, Bolt. One day, the farmer and Spot were in the stables to watch a mare give birth to Bolt\u2019s child. But to their surprise, the mare gave birth to not one, but two, strong, healthy foals. The farmer named the first born Buck and the second Casper.\n\nFrom the very beginning, Buck and Casper shared their father\u2019s competitive spirit. Within seconds of both being born, Buck looks at Casper and says \u201cHey brother! Let\u2019s see who can stand up first.\u201d Casper agreed, \u201cChallenge accepted.\u201d Buck tried to stand first, got half-way erect, and then fell over. Next Casper tried to stand, made it all the way up, wobbled, and fell down. Spot and the farmer watched intently, as this continued back and forth for a couple minutes, each brother standing a little longer than the other, until eventually Buck stood up and remained standing. \u201cI win!\u201d exclaimed Buck. \u201cYou sure did,\u201d Casper replied \u201cbut it was very close. I know I\u2019ll win next time!\u201d\n\nSome time passes, and the farmer decides that Buck and Casper are now old enough to be let out of the stables and explore the farm. The farmer, Spot and all the other animals gather around to watch the two young horses get their first taste of the outdoors. As soon as the two foals exit the stables, Buck turns to Casper and says \u201cYou see that fence across the field? Let\u2019s have a race! First one to the fence and back wins.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re on!\u201d Casper replies.\n\nAnd so the two horses take off towards the fence. First, Buck takes the lead, then Casper pulls ahead, then Buck takes the lead again as they reach the fence. On the way back the two horses are neck-and-neck, Casper ahead one second, Buck the next. Casper gives his all and takes a slight lead. \u201cI\u2019m going to win\u201d he excitedly thinks, but at the last second Buck has a burst of speed and pulls ahead by a foot, winning the race. \u201cI win!\u201d Buck neighs loudly. \u201cYou sure did brother,\u201d Casper replies \u201cbut that was very close. I\u2019ll win the next race, I just know it.\u201d\n\nHaving witnessed their race, the farmer decides to enter them in the next local horse derby. The farmer and Spot sit in the stands, watching with anticipation as the horses line up, Buck and Casper next to each other in lanes 3 and 4. \u201cThis is it! This is the race I\u2019m going to beat you!\u201d Casper says to Buck. \u201cProbably brother! You are very fast and trained very hard\u201d Buck says in return. At the sound of the gunshot, Buck and Casper take off out of the gates. They very quickly get way ahead of the other horses, and the two brothers stay neck-and-neck. First buck is ahead by a few inches, then Casper gets the lead, then Buck again, then Casper; back-and-forth until it seems like Casper finally has the lead. \u201cI got it this time!\u201d Casper whinnies in excitement, but suddenly Buck is right there next to him, and before Casper could dig deep for a burst of speed, they cross the finish line, Buck just a few inches ahead. \u201cDrat!\u201d Casper says, a little upset. \u201cThat was so close! I could taste victory.\u201d \u201cIt was a very good race brother!\u201d Buck says, \u201cI\u2019m very proud of you, that was the closest we\u2019ve ever been. I thought you had it for sure.\u201d\n\nA few years pass of Buck and Casper racing, training, and growing. Year after year the farmer enters them into the races, year after year the farmer and Spot watch, and year after year Buck wins by a hair, with Casper getting closer and closer with each race. Finally, Buck and Casper are so fast and so famous \u2013 The Twin Bolts, they\u2019re called \u2013 that they both get invited to compete in the Kentucky Derby. On the big day, the farmer and Spot watch from home on the TV as Buck and Casper wish each other luck, and go to their gates to await the race. The starting gun fires, and all the horses take off. This time it\u2019s a very close race; all the horses stay tight in a pack for most of the track. But near the end, all the horses begin to tire and slow \u2013 all the horses except for Buck and Casper.\n\nCasper manages to get a good lead, and he looks back to his brother and yells \u201cI\u2019m going to win this time, there\u2019s nothing you can do!\u201d But his cockiness got the better of him, and the farmer, Spot, and Buck all watched in horror as just before the finish line, Casper loses his footing and takes a terrible fall, knocking himself out.\n\nAfter the race, Casper wakes up back home in the stables, Buck watching over him intently. \u201cHow do you feel Casper\u201d Buck asks with concern, but Casper can think only of the race. \u201cDid I win?\u201d he asks. \u201cDid I finally beat you?\u201d Buck shakes his head solemnly \u201cI\u2019m afraid not brother. You stopped just in front of the finish line. The race was stopped because of your injury, but I was declared the winner since I was in second place.\u201d\n\nCasper is devastated by this news. \u201c\u2026but \u2026I was going to win\u201d he says sadly, trying to stand. But one of Casper\u2019s front legs gives him a sharp pain, and he falls over. \u201cAre you okay Casper?\u201d Buck asks, concern heavy in his voice. \u201cThe vet said you broke your leg. You need to give it time to heal.\u201d\n\nAnd so he did, but time never fully healed his leg. For years, Casper stayed at the farm, limping as he tried to run, while Buck continued to win Derby after Derby, eventually breaking his father Bolt\u2019s speed record and winning more Derbies than any other horse in memory. Spot would watch Casper from the porch, saddened by the state of the once proud equine.\n\nMany years later, the farmer retires Buck from racing. The two horses, now old, spend most of their time in the stables, Casper always quiet and sad. One day, Buck turns to Casper and says \u201cYou know brother, I miss the old days when we would race side-by-side. What do you say to one last race, huh?\u201d But Casper shakes his head and says \u201cThere\u2019s no point. Even in my prime, I could never beat you. What chance do I have now that I am old and lame?\u201d Saddened by his brother\u2019s depression, Buck gets an idea. \u201cYou know what brother? You\u2019re the reason I ran so fast. You inspired me, our whole lives, to push myself and be the best I could be. I always looked up to you.\u201d This makes Casper a little happy, so Buck continues \u201cI bet that you, my greatest inspiration, will beat me. There\u2019s no way you\u2019ll lose again, you\u2019re too good\u201d. \u201cAlright,\u201d Casper says, his spirits high for the first time in years \u201cI\u2019ll race you. To the fence and back, just like when we were kids. And this time I\u2019ll win!\u201d\n\nAs Buck and Casper exit the stables, Spot \u2013 now also very old \u2013 pads over to watch. The two horses start running, much slower than in previous years, but still with as much intensity as their younger selves would muster. Casper, his excitement allowing him to ignore his old injury, takes the lead. Buck, digging deep, catches up, and they continue neck-and-neck. On the final stretch, Casper pulls ahead. After so many years, he\u2019d finally get to know what it felt like to be number one, first place, the winner. Casper had never felt more proud or excited than at this moment in his life. But just before as he reaches the barn, Buck bolts past him, winning by a hair. Casper is crushed.\n\nNow Spot, who watched the young horses grow up from afar, gets angry at this. He walks up to Buck and growls \u201cWhy?! After all the years, after all your victories, why? You couldn\u2019t let your brother have this one race? You just broke his heart!\u201d To which Buck replies\n\n\u201cHoly shit, a talking dog!\u201d\n",

You're not a monk.\" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.\n\nYears later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.\n\nThe monks reply, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\"\nThe man says, \"If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.\"\n\nThe monks reply, \"You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.\"\n\nThe man sets about his task. \n\nAfter years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.\n\n\"In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.\"\n\nThe monks reply, \"Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.\"\n\nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \"The sound is beyond that door.\"\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.\n\nFinally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, \"This is the last key to the last door.\"\n\nThe man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!\nWith trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......\nBut, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",

Her mind races, what else will he do? Will he use her wedding ring? Will this woman drive her car? Her mind just can't shut down thinking of all this. So finally she decides to ask him about her stuff and figures she'd start with something easy asking, \"If I die and you remarry will you let her use my golf clubs?\"\n\nNow the guy who just wants to sleep and has been woken up to answer all this what he considers nonsense, honestly quite a bit irritated over this, and says, \"Well of course not.\"\n\nShocked she replies back, \"well why not?\"\n\nHe replies, \"because she's left handed, now go to sleep.\"",

Rather than taking the final then, they found their professor after the final to explain to him why they missed the final.\n\nThey told him that they went up to the University of Tennessee for the weekend, and had planned to come back in time to study, but that they had a flat tire on the way back, and didn't have a spare, and couldn't get help for a long time, so they were late in getting back to campus. The professor thought this over and told them they could make up the final on the following day.  The two guys were elated and relieved. They studied that night and went in the next day for the final.\n\nThe professor placed them in separate rooms, and handed each of them a test booklet and told them to begin. They looked at the first problem, which was worth 5 points.  It was something simple about Molarity & Solutions.\n\n\"Cool ,\" they thought.  \"This is going to be easy.\"  They did that problem and then turned the page.\n\nThey were not prepared, however, for what they saw on this page.

She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.\nThe next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her \"womanly\" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.\nBut the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.\nAnyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.",

        "body": "Little Jimmy was on the playground during recess one day. He had just started kindergarten a few months ago. Jimmy was a good kid and the kind of student any teacher would love to have since he was always trying to learn new things. He always took his parents' advice to learn one new thing every day and today was no different from any other.\n\nLittle Jimmy was quietly playing in the sand by himself when one of the bigger kids, the size of a fifth grader, stomped up and pushed him to the ground. He leaned in close and whispered into Jimmy's ear, calling him a name Jimmy had never heard before. The kid leaned back and sneered his freckly face at Jimmy in a loathsome way while little Jimmy just stared at him, dumbstruck.\n\n\u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d little Jimmy asked. \n\nThe kid's sneer grew into a smirk, \u201cGo ask the teacher, she'll tell you!\u201d\n\nNow Jimmy may have only been five but he wasn't completely stupid. He knew he had just been called a bad name. But his curiosity was killing him so as soon as recess was over he raced inside to talk to the teacher. Maybe she could even tell him what it meant!\n\n\u201cTeacher, teacher! Before we start class can I ask you something?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it, Jimmy?\u201d his teacher asked.\n\n\u201cWell, I was on the playground at recess and one of the big kids called me a bad word, but I don't even know what it means.\u201d\n\nThinking Jimmy was more upset about the name-calling than the fact that he had no idea what the word meant, his teacher, completely well-versed in the idea that five year-olds thought that \u201cpoop\u201d was a bad word, decided to cut him the deal she usually did in these cases, since the kids were usually clearly uncomfortable saying words like \u201cdoo-doo-head\u201d out loud. \u201cOkay Jimmy, I can only help you if you tell me the word. But since it's a bad word you can just whisper it in my ear and I will take care of it.\u201d\n\nJimmy hesitates but a moment before leaning in and whispering in her ear. Her eyes grew wide and she shouted, \u201cJIMMY, THAT'S HORRIBLE! GO TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE RIGHT NOW, YOUNG MAN, YOU ARE IN DETENTION!\u201d\n\nJimmy yelped but obediently ran down to the principal's office before. It's rare that a five year-old gets detention in and of itself but Jimmy had never been in trouble before. He was scared.\n\nJimmy sat down in a chair outside of the principal's office, impatiently kicking his legs and twiddling his thumbs. The principal was inside having a phone conversation, likely with Jimmy's teacher. After a few minutes the door creaked open an the principal smiled at Jimmy. \u201cCome in, sit down.\u201d Again, Jimmy obeyed and stared dejectedly at the placard that said \u201cPRINCIPAL.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow Jimmy, you're a good kid,\u201d Jimmy didn't look up. \u201cI know you're a good kid. So I need you to tell me in your own words, why do you think you're here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you see, I was on the playground at recess and one of the big kids called me a bad word, and I didn't even know what it meant, so I asked the teacher about it and she yelled at me and sent me here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see. Well Jimmy, since you're such a good kid and all, what word could be so horrible that your teacher would send you to me?\u201d His eyes were wide with surprise that this was all that it took.\n\n\u201cWell, I dunno. It must be a pretty bad word...\u201d\n\n\u201cJimmy, I'm your principal. It's my job to look out for your well-being. It's just us two in here, but if you want you can just whisper it in my ear if that makes you feel better. You can trust me.\u201d\n\nJimmy sighed and leaned over to the principal and carefully whispered into the principal's ear. His eyes grew wide and he slammed his fists down on his desk, making his placard jump and fall to the ground, \u201cJIMMY THAT'S HORRIBLE! GO HOME RIGHT NOW YOU ARE EXPELLED!\u201d\n\nJimmy walked out of the office, defeated. On his way home he kicked rocks and dawdled. Eventually he found his way through the front door. His mother had been sitting patiently waiting for him.\n\n\u201cJimmy, sweetheart,\u201d her eyes were filled with concern for her son. \u201cWhat happened at school today? I just got off the phone with your pricipal. He seemed really angry.\u201d\n\nJimmy looked up at her with eyes as big as dinner plates. \u201cOkay, so I was on the playground at recess today and one of the big kids called me a bad word, and I didn't even know what it meant, so I asked the teacher about it and she yelled at me and sent me to detention in the principal's office. The principal yelled at me and told me I was expelled and sent me home.\u201d\n\n\u201cSweetie, what word could be so horrible that you would get expelled from school?\u201d His mother's mind was racing as to where he even learned a bad word, they never used bad language at home.\n\n\u201cMom... I don't know... it must be a pretty bad word, it's gotten me in a lot of trouble already.\u201d Jimmy stared at his feet as his mom closed in. She leaned down and gave him a great big hug.\n\n\u201cI'm your mommy. You can tell me anything and I'll love you and take care of you no matter what. But I can't fix this for you if you don't tell me what the word was. I'll tell you what, even though it's just you and me you can lean in and whisper it in my ear, okay? You can trust me.\u201d\n\nJimmy was close to tears but he put on a brave face and nodded before leaning in and whispering into her ear.\n\nHer eyes grew wide and she practically threw Jimmy from her arms. \u201cJIMMY THAT'S HORRIBLE!\u201d she shrieked, \u201cGO TO YOUR ROOM YOU ARE GROUNDED! FOREVER!\u201d\n\nJimmy slowly and sadly climbed up the stairs to his bedroom. He sat on his bed, still fighting back tears but just barely. The hours stretched and he just stared at the wall, feeling hopeless. Eventually, just before dark, he heard his father's car pull up into the driveway. The sound of his footsteps followed to the front door and once his father came inside he could hear his parents speaking in hushed tones. \n\nEventually his father climbed the stairs and softly opened the door to Jimmy's room. \u201cHeya kiddo. I just talked to your mom. Do you want to tell me what happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, well... I was on the playground at recess today and one of the big kids called me a bad word, and I didn't even know what it meant, so I asked the teacher about it and she yelled at me and sent me to detention in the principal's office. The principal yelled at me and told me I was expelled and sent me home. Then mom yelled at me and grounded me. Forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must be a pretty bad word then, huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, Jimmy, I would love to get you out of the doghouse with your mom. I can help but only if you tell me what the word was.\u201d\n\nJimmy just stared at him as tears welled up in his eyes.\n\n\u201cJimmy, we're both men here. Women can be over-sensitive, but I think I can handle it. If you're uncomfortable you can just whisper it in my ear. You can trust me, okay?\u201d\n\nJimmy looked unconvinced but wanted to believe in his father. He took a big gulp and leaned close to whisper into his father's ear. His dad's eyes grew wide and his father stood up, screaming \u201cJIMMY THAT'S HORRIBLE! GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE RIGHT NOW AND NEVER COME BACK! I HAVE NO SON!\u201d\n\nJimmy froze for a moment before booking it out of the house. He ran as fast and as far as his feet would carry him and before long it was completely dark out. Eventually he slowed down almost to a complete stop, dragging his feet along the sidewalk. Eventually he just sat on the curb and cried. After a few minutes a police car puled up to poor little Jimmy on the curb.\n\n\u201cSon, come here.\u201d Jimmy looked but but didn't move. \u201cSon, come here, it's okay. What's your name?\u201d\n\nJimmy's eyes were those of a shell-shocked soldier, \u201cUm... it's Jimmy, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Jimmy, what are you doing out alone after dark?\u201d\n\nJimmy took a deep breath. \u201cIt all started when I was on the playground at recess today and one of the big kids called me a bad word, and I didn't even know what it meant, so I asked the teacher about it and she yelled at me and sent me to detention in the principal's office. The principal yelled at me and told me I was expelled and sent me home. Then mom yelled at me and grounded me to my room forever. Then my dad yelled at me and kicked me out of the house and told me to never come back and that he had no son.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Jimmy...\u201d a look of concern crossed the officer's face, \u201cwhat word could be so horrible that your dad would kick you out of the house?\u201d\n\nA look of fear flashed across Jimmy's face. \u201cUh... I dunno. It must be a pretty bad word, it's gotten me in so much trouble already....\u201d\n\n\u201cJimmy,\u201d the cop flashed a genuine smile, \u201cNo little boy should be on his own. No matter how bad the word is. I'm a police officer and it's my duty to serve and protect you. If it makes you feel better you can just whisper it in my ear.\u201d\n\nJimmy felt conflicted but the police officer's offer seemed sincere enough that he eventually leaned in and ever-so-softly whispered into his ear.\n\n\u201cJIMMY! THAT'S HORRIBLE!\u201d The cop was on him in an instant. He whipped out his handcuffs and slammed poor Jimmy's face into the hood of the car, the whole while reading him his rights.\n\nLater, in court, Jimmy found himself staring up at a judge. She didn't look scary but Jimmy could barely keep from pissing his little trousers.\n\n\u201cJimmy,\u201d she said authoritatively, \u201cDo you have any idea why you're here today?\u201d\n\nJimmy had a thousand-yard stare, \u201cWell your honour, it all started when I was on the playground at recess the other day and one of the big kids called me a bad word, and I didn't even know what it meant, so I asked the teacher about it and she yelled at me and sent me to detention in the principal's office. The principal yelled at me and told me I was expelled and sent me home. Then mom yelled at me and grounded me to my room forever. Then my dad yelled at me and kicked me out of the house and told me to never come back and that he had no son. The police officer arrested me and now I'm here.\u201d Tears welled up in his eyes.\n\n\u201cWell now, Jimmy, what word could be so horrible that you would get arrested?\u201d\n\nPure panic took him. \u201cWell... gee... your honour its got me in so much trouble already... I really don't know if I could say it in front of all of these people.\u201d\n\n\u201cJimmy, look, if you're really worried you may approach the bench and whisper it in my ear.\u201d\n\nJimmy's face was white and he didn't respond.\n\n\u201cLook Jimmy, I don't want to see a five year-old to be convicted of a crime, but I really can't help you unless I know what the word is. And I'll just remind you that you are under oath.\u201d\n\nJimmy approached the judge in a zombie-like state. He leaned in close, whispered into the judge's ear and without missing a beat the judge slammed down his gavel, \u201cJIMMY! THAT'S HORRIBLE! I SENTENCE YOU TO TWENTY YEARS IN PRISON WITHOUT PAROLE!\u201d\n\nTwenty year's later Jimmy is serving the last day of his sentence in a maximum security prison. They've tried to keep him isolated from the other prisoners but overcrowding in the prison system has led to him being forced to share a cell for his final few hours. A man with face tattoos jacked from the floor to the ceiling with muscles was dumped in through the cell door.\n\n\u201cHey.\u201d\n\nJimmy didn't say anything at first.\n\n\u201cHey. Look at me when I'm talking to you.\u201d Jimmy made eye contact for a moment before pulling his eyes away. \u201cYou, what's your name.\u201d\n\n\u201cJimmy.\u201d\n\n\u201cJimmy, eh? Name's Eddie. What're you in for?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's really a long story.\u201d\n\n\u201cTry me, I've got nowhere else to be.\u201d Eddie smiled in earnest at Jimmy. Jimmy felt everything in his body screaming at him not to talk about what happened twenty years ago, but at the same time he'd been isolated for so long he just felt the need to let it out.\n\n\u201cOkay, you see... twenty years ago I was five years old. I'm on the playground, minding my own business during reccess. One of the older kids called me some curse word and I didn't even know what it meant. So I asked the teacher about it and she starts screaming like a banshee and I get sent to the office. The principal ended up expelling me so I went home. My mom completely lost her shit and tried to put me under house arrest. My dad ended up disowning me and then a police officer stopped to help but when he found out he arrested me. The judge sentenced me to twenty years without parole. But I get out today, and soon.\u201d Jimmy felt some relief but also terror because even though he had no education other than what he learned in prison he wasn't too stupid to not know what was coming next.\n\n\u201cWell, Jesus! What word could be so horrible you'd get locked up in here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know... this word has gotten me in so much shit already I don't want to go through this again. Especially since as of today my time has been served.\u201d\n\n\u201cJimmy, look at me. You said a bad word as a five year-old and you're locked up with me. You know what I did? I strangled my girlfriend until she passed out, tried to smother her with a pillow, and when that took too long I grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed her thirty-seven times in the chest. I ain't no rocket surgeon but I can't think of any words more horrible than what I done to her. Look, I get it if you don't want the other guys to hear. Just whisper it to me, no one else has to know.\u201d\n\nJimmy straightened himself, readying for the response as he leaned in close and whispered to Eddie.\n\nEddie recoiled in horror, \u201cJIMMY! THAT'S HORRIBLE!\u201d Jimmy began to raise his hands to defend himself. But Eddie just stared at him slack-jawed before giving him a heart slap on the back. \u201cJesus. You got me.\u201d\n\n8It felt like Jimmy had been holding his breath for years and he had finally been allowed to exhale.  \u201cYou wanna know what the worst part is? I still don't even know what it *means*.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell Jimmy, I can't explain it to you.\u201d Jimmy's face fell, \u201cBut I do know a guy. I can give you his address, he'll be able to make it clear to you why you've been put through hell way better'n I can. His name is Lou.\u201d\n\nTears of gratitude leaked from Jimmy's sunken eyes and he gave Eddie the biggest hug he could muster. Eddie didn't seem to mind.\n\nFinally, once Jimmy was left to his own devices, he tracked down the address and found it was just across the street from where he was standing. Jimmy was so excited to finally have some answers that he bolted across the street.\n\nUnfortunately for Jimmy he ran into the path of an on-coming bus and he died instantly.\n\n***********\n\nPhew! This is my go-to bar joke. You tell it about two drinks in so people are a little more open to listening to a rambling, repetitive story. I actually had one person jokingly threaten to murder me for wasting approximately ten minutes of their life and another friend still playfully slaps me across the face any time I say the name \u201cJimmy.\u201d I've never typed it out before, this was fun. At just over 2,700 words it took me two sittings.\n\n***********\n\n**Epilogue:**\n\nSo Jimmy's in Hell and the devil turns to Jimmy and asks, \u201cJimmy, why on earth did they send you here?\u201d",

The guide just shakes his head again. \"Very bad if drums stop.\"\n\nThe morning of the third day, the drums finally stop. The explorer turns to his guide, worried. \"So, what does it mean that the drums stopped?\" The guide grimaces and says, \"Very bad. Now come bass solo.\"",

He used the arm (and attached hand) for everything.\n\nGood for him that a doctor had just completed building some great new technology: the Voice Activated Arm (tm) - patent pending.\n\nUpon waking up for the first time since the accident, he was greeted by a kindly doctor sitting by his hospital bed. Looking down the man sees all the needles and tubes going into him, and asks what happened.\n\nThe kind old doctor explains the situation, and with a pregnant pause began to explain the depth of his physical damage -- broken ribs, busted lip, and of course his missing arm.\n\nThe man looks down and to the right. He doesn't *feel* different. His arm looks no different. \n\nThe doctor explains that it is voice activated -- tell it what to do preceded by \"voice activated arm...\" and if it can, it will follow the command.\n\nWell this seems too space-age to be real, so he decides to not ponder it immediately, and to get some rest.\n\nFast forward 6 weeks and the man has been out of the hospital for 3 of those weeks, constantly dodging the calls of the doctor, because he doesn't need false hope.  He finally gets tired of being useless and frustrated, and decide to finally call the doctor back.\n\nThe man first states, \n>Doc, I know you said this arm was high tech, but it just dangles uselessly at my side.\n\nThe kindly doctor responds,\n>As I tried to explain at the hospital, the arm is voice activated. You must give it command in much the same way you would a computer. For example, if you wanted to open a door, you would say \"voice activated arm, open door.\" Now, you can stack commands, like \"voice activated arm, open fridge. Grab beer.\" This will instruct your arm to first open the fridge, then grab a beer\n\n\nTo this, the man replies,\n>I'm not sure, doc, but I'll give it a try...\n\n\nLater that day, he had to use the restroom. As soon as he got in there, he realized this was a perfect time to test the arm.  He didn't want to be in public talking to his arm just yet.\n\nFirst, the man opens with \n>Voice activated arm, unzip pants\n\n\nZip\n\n\n>Cool. Ok. Voice activated arm, whip my dick out. Aim towards toilet\n\n\nOut it comes. Dead center aim acquired.\n\n\n>Fucking amazing. Hey. This feels pretty good. Jerk it off.\n\n\nThe arm promptly detached the man's salamander.\n\n>FUCK ME !\n\n\n\n----\n*yes, I know this is old. Not my invention, but it's my unique telling. First time posting to /r/jokes, so be brutal... Wait -- the other thing.\n\nAlso, wrote all this on phone, and am trying to fix formatting.",

He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else. So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation. The old man said, \"Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except.... and he stopped. \"Except what?\" the man asked. \"Nothing, nothing.\" \"C'mon, tell me! I need something!\" \"Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick.'\" \"So what's up with this voodoo dick?\" he asked.\n\nThe old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said \"Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!\" The old man replied, \"But you haven't seen what it'll do yet.\" He pointed to a door and said \"Voodoo dick, the door.\" The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said \"Voodoo dick, get back in your box!\" The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there quiescent once more. \"I'll take it!\" said the businessman. The old man resisted, saying it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say \"Voodoo dick, my pussy.\" He left for his trip satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.\n\nAfter he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said \"Voodoo dick, my pussy!\" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgotten to tell her how to shut it off. So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing.\n\nThe officer looked at her for a second, and then said \"Yeah, right.. Voodoo dick, my ass!\"\n",

This might cause a bear to charge.\nVisitors should also carry a pepper spray can just in case a bear is encountered. Spraying the pepper into the air will irritate the bear's sensitive nose and it will run away.\nIt is also a good idea to keep an eye out for fresh bear scat so you have an idea if bears are in the area. People should be able to recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear scat.\nBlack bear droppings are smaller and often contain berries, leaves, and possibly bits of fur.

At the end of the night the bartender makes the last call and Tony, disappointed, makes his way out the back to head home. As the door to the bar closes behind him, he notices a drunk hobo passed out over the sidewalk railing. Tony glances around to see if anyone is nearby and prods the hobo to see if he'll wake up. The hobo grumbles slightly but otherwise doesn't show any intention of waking up anytime soon. So, after not getting any action at the bar and knowing that nobody would ever find out, he drops the hobo's pants and removes his own and gets it on with the hobo. Tony finishes up and cleans up himself and the hobo. He begins to walk away but starts feeling guilty for using the hobo so he slips five bucks into the hobo's pocket and heads home.\n\nThe next morning the hobo wakes up disoriented and hungover. He looks around and slides his hands into his pockets as he begins his morning walk around the block only to feel something strange with his hands. He pulls out the five bucks and is ecstatic! He can't believe it and runs down to the liquor store, slams the five bucks down on the counter and says, \"Give me five bucks worth of the cheapest stuff you've got!\" The clerk takes the money and hands the hobo the cheapest liquor they've got. The hobo grabs it and walks out of the store, drinking the liquor for the rest of the day. Eventually, he heads back to his spot behind the bar and passes out.\n\nMeanwhile, Tony headed back to the bar in hopes of getting some action from the ladies tonight but just like last night, every girl in the bar didn't even notice him. Closing time rolls around and Tony heads out the back door to make the long, lonely trip back home. Tired and hurt, Tony barely noticed the hobo slumped over the railing again. Tony wasn't planning on spending the night alone so decides that it can't hurt anything to have a go with the hobo again. He yanks down the hobo's pants and unzips his own and starts going at it with the hobo. A few minutes later, he cleans up, slips a five in the hobo's pocket and heads home satisfied.\n\nThe next morning, the hobo wakes up more hungover than yesterday and slips his hands into his pocket and yelps for joy as he pulls another five bucks out of his pocket. \"It's a miracle!\" he says to himself as he makes his way back to the liquor store. He walks in, slams down the five bucks, and demands cheapest liquor. The clerk grabs the cash and hands over the liquor and the hobo makes his way out of the store. The hobo gulps down the liquor throughout the day and passes out behind the bar again for another night.\n\nMeanwhile, Tony was telling all his single friends who couldn't get any action that they should all come to the bar with him tonight in hopes of having better luck in numbers. A few of them have other plans but three of his friends decide to go. So the four of them head to the bar and just like the last two nights, all the women ignore Tony and pay no attention to his friends. So when the bartender makes the last call, the four of them head out the back to go their separate ways but lo-and-behold the hobo is slumped over the railing again. Tony's friends laugh at him and begin heading home but Tony stops them and lets them in on his secret. They can't believe it so Tony tells them to watch as he goes at it with the hobo for the third night in a row. Tony's friends are amazed and each one of them takes turns with the hobo, leaving five bucks each time. Satisfied, they all head home for the night.\n\nThe next morning the hobo wakes up and reaches into his pockets and pulls out twenty bucks! He looks at the wad of cash and sprints to the liquor market. He slams twenty bucks on the counter and says, \"Give me twenty bucks of your most expensive liquor!\" The clerk takes the money and says, \"You know, you could get a lot more liquor if you get twenty bucks of our cheapest stuff again.\" The hobo nods, \"Yeah, I know, but that cheap stuff is making my ass hurt.\"",

However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. \n\nFinally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.' \n\nThe father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.' \n\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball. \n\nThe boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again. \n\nThe next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. \n\n'Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, `If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' \n\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls. \n\nThe boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. \n\nThe next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. \n\n'Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' \n\n'A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. \n\n'I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' \n\nAnd so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. \n\nThe boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. \n\n'Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' \n\nThe son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humour me, dear father.' \n\nThe carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. \n\nThe next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. \n\n'Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' \n\nOne of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. \n\nThe next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. \n\nThe following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. \n\nThe following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. \n\n'Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' \n\nIt was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. \n\nThe next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. \n\n'Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' \n\nThat night, the son spent on board the tanker. \n\nThe next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. \n\nA few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. \n\nHis father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' \n\nWeakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' \n\n'Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. \n\n'Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe son nodded weakly. \n\nThe next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. \n\n'Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,' the father requested. \n\nThe son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. \n\n`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. \n\n`I- I-' \n\nThen he died",

He has little to no friends and uses alcohol a little too much.\n\nSo, down on his luck, he gets hammered. Night after night, with no one to console him. He's brushing his feet against the ground on his home one night and hears a loud CLUNK. He looks down and picks up some sort of ornamental teapot? It has a cool looking design under a coat of ash and dirt so he rubs it off and POOF whaddya know! Out pips a genie.\n\nThe genie looks down in his glorious fog and says to the man, \"congratulations!  You have awoken azavaad the glorious genie. I shall grant you only one wish for releasing me.\"\n\nSo the man simply replies, \"I want to be the luckiest man alive.\"  \n\nAnd so it was done.\n\nThe man wakes up in his house thinking he had an awkward drunken dream. But as he looks around his house it has completely transformed! \n\nThere was a chandelier, a grand piano, candelabras made of gold, and a stack of cash on his coffee table.  \n\n\"Wow\" he thought \"it worked!\"\n\nSo he decides to celebrate. Going to the nearest bar. As he enters sirens go off and balloons and dollar bills and glitter fall to the ground.\n\n\"Congratulations!\" Says the bartender, \"you are one lucky guy! You're our 1000th customer and you get a free bar tab for life!\"\n\nSo he drinks himself almost under the table and decides to press his luck at lottery tickets. Well lo and behold he won the max prize on every shitty scratch ticket he could purchase.  This continued for months.  At the casino, taking home strippers and beautiful women, celebrities inviting him to the best parties.\n\nBut, alas, he is alone, and steeps into his lonely depression once more.\n\nSo he returns to the genie. \n\n\"Hey, genie, I wanted to be the luckiest man alive and while I'm grateful our definition of luck may be different. To me, being lucky would be settling down with a beautiful woman and having a family and living a successful and peaceful life.\"\n\n\"My bad,\" Says the great asavaad to him, \"I shall correct this mistake and give you the most exotic woman for you to have for the rest of your life.\"\n\nAnd again, it was done. He awoke in his awesome new house. Still money and glorious furniture everywhere. So he says fuck it I'll go get a coffee. As he is leaving with his coffee a woman bumps into him, spilling his coffee everywhere.  He looks into her apologetic eyes and sees a beautiful Indian woman. With an accent, shaul, and dot on her head. Beautiful brown skin, dark eyes, and silky long hair. The whole package. She offers to buy him another and they strike up a conversation.  And they end up having almost everything in common. They sat at the coffee shop for hours and talked and laughed. They were in love.\n\nThey went home and had the most romantic and passionate sex anyone has ever had, all night until they fell asleep from exhaustion. They spent every waking minute together. And with his riches he took her all over the world. So one day he proposes and naturally she says yes. They have a small beautiful wedding and a glorious honeymoon with everything he and she ever wanted. They have another round of passionate sex, even better than the time before until they pass out from exhaustion again\n\nIn the morning the man awakes, and is looking at her beautiful, naked, sleeping body. He runs his hand down her cheek and admires her. He truly is the luckiest man alive.\n\nBut then, still in her slumber, he notices the dot on her head is smudged.  Which is wierd because he's never seen her without it. So he rubs it a little and it starts to fade away. And then the paint chips off a little so he starts to scratch it.  AND THEN HE WON A TRUCK!",

Little Johnny was surprised, but then he just realized something and thinks aloud, ''OH!! Now I understand the government!

Glad to be on his way, Johnny quick!y walked the half dozen blocks to his date's home, excited about the evening's prospects.\n\nJohnny rang the doorbell.  His soon-to-be date's mother answered the door and said, \"You must be Johnny! Suzy has been talking about you all afternoon come in!  We'll be having dinner soon and Suzy will be down in a few minutes, feel free to watch TV\" and with what she disappeared into the kitchen. \n\nJohnny now was starting to feel a little nervous, wondering when Suzy would appear. Several minutes pass and finally the girl of his dreams is standing in front of him. \"Hi Johnny! Sorry I made you wait so long, I had trouble figuring out what to wear\"  As if on cue, Suzy's mom said, \"I know you guys have a movie to catch so let's go to the dining room so you can eat and get out of here.\n\nSuzy's father and mother entered the dining room.  The father giving Johnny a stern looking review. Johnny was now obviously nervous. His date squeezed his hand and whispered, \"don't let him bother you, he must have had a bad day\".\n\nAs they seated, the mother said, \"Johnny, we're a deeply religious family and we always give thanks for our meals by saying grace\". Johnny said, \" Can I say the grace?\"  Suzy looked surprised, then a bit proud as Johnny began to pray.\n\nJohnny started praying in a very low and indiscernible pattern. Mumbling and unintelligible, nearly under his breath. Mother looked at father thru one open eye, then at her daughter as Johnny continued to go on and on and on, when finally, Suzy leaned over and whispered to Johnny, \"I didn't know you were religious?\" .....Johnny whispered in return, \"I didn't know your dad was a pharmacist!\"",

Where he once had strong opinions, he is now in total conflict with points from both sides. It doesn't seem like it's possible to solve anything that's wrong with the world.

He could live in an oblivious bliss.\n\nAfter the wish, he stands there, staring blankly for a few minutes, until the genie reminds him he has another wish left to make. Surprised, he stands there for some time thinking about what it should be. Eventually, he makes his decision, and speaks slowly and simply;  \n\u201cI want to run for president, and make America great again.\u201d",

I've been riddled with guilt these past few months and have been trying to pluck up the courage to tell you to your face, but I am at least now telling in text as I can\u2019t live with myself a moment longer without you knowing.  The truth is, I have been sharing your wife, day and night when you're not around.  In fact, probably more than you. \n\n I haven\u2019t been getting it at home recently, but that's no excuse I know. The temptation was just too much. I can no longer live with the guilt and I hope you will accept my sincerest apologies and forgive me.  I promise that it won't happen again.  Please come up with a fee for usage, and I'll pay you.\n\n Regards, Alan.\n\n \n\nThe Actions:\n\n John, feeling insulted and betrayed, grabbed his gun, stomped next door and shot his neighbor dead.  He returned home where he poured himself a stiff drink and sat down on the sofa.  He took out his phone where he saw he had a subsequent message from his neighbor.\n\n \n\nThe Second Message:\n\n Hi John, \n\nThis is Alan next door again.  Sorry about the slight typo on my last text.  I expect you worked it out anyway, but as I\u2019m sure you noticed that my smart phone\u2019s Autocorrect feature changed \u201cWi-Fi\u201d to \"Wife\u201d.  Technology eh??

The manager asks what the song is called and the pianist replies, \"Fuck you and your mother, you shit eating whore\".\n\nClearly upset by the title of the song, the manager attempts to regain his composure and asks the pianist, \"um, do you know any other songs?\"\n\nThe pianist starts right in on the most beautiful piece the manager had ever heard, and by the time the pianist finished, the manager had tears in his eyes.\n\nAfraid to ask, the manager asked what that one was called.  The pianist said it was one of the first songs he ever wrote, and it was called \"Suck my hairy white ass, you commie fuck!\"\n\nClearly impressed with the skill of the pianist but fearful for the effect the song titles might have on his business the manager makes a deal with the player.\n\n\"I will hire you, and pay you with $100 bar tab per night and 5% of the door, but you're not allowed to tell anyone what your songs are called.\"\n\nThe pianist agrees, just happy to have a gig.\n\nSo he's playing the first night, really enjoying himself, drinking for free and all of the patrons are enjoying the music as well.  At some point, very drunk, the pianist needs to go relieve himself so takes a break from playing.\n\nWhen he returns from the bathroom, a beautiful woman approaches him and quietly asks him, \"Do you know your dick is out and everyone can see it?\"\n\nThe piano player's eyes get wide, and he excitedly replies, \"Know it!?  I fucking *wrote it*!\"\n",

The limousine driver commented that he'd heard the speech enough times, and that even though he didn't understand it, he felt as if he could deliver it word-for-word. So the physicist agreed to trade places and let him give the speech, and the physicist would sit in the back and wear the limousine driver's uniform. After giving the speech flawlessly, the limousine driver opened the floor for questions from the students (typically there were none). However, at this particular University there was a rather egotistical student who thought he was smart enough to compete mentally with the Nobel physicist. The question took 5 minutes to get out and would require a rather lengthy explanation and some complex calculus to answer. Without batting an eye, the limousine driver responded to the young student by saying, \"The answer to that question is so easy, I'll let my limousine driver, seated in the back, respond.\"",

The Scotsman sees him picking up the egg and says: ''What are you doing with my egg?'' The Englishman replies ''It's in my yard, so it's mine!''

I warn you though that even 10% transference will be the most pain he has ever felt before in his life.\"  The husband, not wanting his wife to suffer, said okay to the treatment.  So the doctor hooks the woman up to the machine and turns it on to 5% just to start.  After a few minutes of waiting he asks the husband if he's okay to increase the percentage and he says yes.  The doctor continues to crank it up to 10% and again asks the husband if he's okay and again the husband says that he's fine. The doctor, a little confused now, turns the machine up higher to 50%.  The husband still says that he's fine and the wife seems to be feeling much less pain. The doctor, completely bewildered now, cranks the machine all the way up to 100% and the baby is delivered relatively pain free and the couple go home.\n\nWhen they get home the mail man is dead on the porch.",

Mortar shells explode all around and the two men are sweating lest a shell might land atop of them.  As the evening wears on and nerves become frazzled in the stifling heat, one of the men confides that he has to go to the bathroom really bad.  \"Number  1 or Number 2?\" his friend asks.  \"Number 2.\"  He says.  \"Well you can't do your business in here.  There is no telling how long we'll be trapped in this foxhole before reinforcements arrive to liberate us.  So you'll just have to hold it.\"\n\nNighttime falls, but the shelling does not let up.  With daylight the two men peer outside to discover it would be another long day of hunkering down.   As the minutes build into hours the one soldier finally blurts out, \"Joe, I just can't hold it any longer.  I've gotta go to the bathroom.\"  Joe looks over at his companion who is ashen faced, and visibly sweating:  \"Well Slim, it appears that you have two choices.  Take a crap in here and I shoot you, or go and do it out there and the Germans shoot you.  Which will it be?\"\n\n\"I've been considering that,\" says Slim.  \"Do you see that foxhole over  yonder?\"  and he points it out.  \"I saw a mortar shell land atop of it yesterday and there's been no activity since, so I can safely say the fellas inside won't complain if I use it as a latrine.  If you'll cover me, I think I can make it over , do my business, signal you, and then come back under your cover fire.\"\n\nJoe agrees, and Slim makes a successful dash for the neighboring foxhole while he lays down the cover fire.  \"Damn if the lucky fool didn't make it,\" Joe swore.  Half an hour passed as Joe waited for the signal from Slim.  No Slim.  An hour passed.  Still no Slim.  Two hours.  Then Three hours.  No Slim.  Nightfall arrived and still no signal came from the other foxhole.  \"I guess Ol' Slim must have caught a bullet after all.\"  He  said remorsefully, and turned in for the night.\n\nCome daylight, Joe's eyes were on the neighboring foxhole intently hoping for a signal from his friend.  It never came.  That day too passed as uneventfully as the one before it, and Joe was convinced Slim was dead.   But come the next morning, Joe was amazed to see Slim signaling at him from the neighboring foxhole.  Joe signaled back, and laid down a cover fire as Slim made his mad dash back.  Diving inside just as a cavalcade of enemy bullets smashed into the sandbags.\n\n\"What the hell took you so long over there?\"  Joe asked.\n\n\"You wouldn't believe me if I told you,\" said Slim.\n\n\"Try me.\"  Says Joe.\n\n\"Well pard, when I dove into that foxhole.  I landed right on top of one of them Red Cross nurses.  Her name was Sally, and she must be around nineteen years old, and her with the best figure I've seen on a woman since this war started.\"\n\n\"Damn your luck,\"  says Joe.  \"What'd you do.\"\n\n\"What do you think?\"  Slim answered.  \"I was a man, she was a woman.    We have been making sweet. sweet love from that moment on.\"\n\n\"You have been making love this entire time?\"  Joe asks.\n\n\"Damn straight.\"  Slim says.   \n\n\"Hot damn!\"  Joe stutters.  \"Do you suppose she'll be willing to give me a roll in the hay if I was to make a call over to that foxhole myself.\"\n\n\"She's not a woman to turn a man down, that's for sure.\"  Assures Slim.\n\n\"Oh boy.  Oh boy.\"  Says Joe as sheds his heavy backpack.  \"You say she has a shapely figure.  How is she for looks?\"\n\n\"You know what pard,\" Slim answers.  \"I couldn't rightly say.

In this room it was stacked chest high in 100 dollar bills. He contemplates what it could possibly be for. As he sits down at the bar he asks for a drink. When the bartender pours the drink the man says,         \"Sir, if you don't mind me asking, what is that room for?\"                                                                               \"That room contains all the money of the people that failed my bet.\" The bartender replies.                  The man continued to drink while wondering what the bet could possibly be. He asked for another drink. This time when the Bartender gets there he asked what the bet was. The bartender simply stated the the bet was for only those brave enough to do the bet, not letting him know what it was. The man was two drinks in and was feeling pretty sure of himself and took the bet.                                       Thus, the bartender told him,\"see that man over there in the corner. You have to punch and knock him out with one punch.\"                                                 \"I think I can do that. Whiskey,\" said the man.                                  \"But there's more!\" Replied the bartender.                     \"Okay, what else do I have to do? Whiskey!\"              \"I have a rabid Pittbull upstairs who needs his teeth pulled out by hand. Also, my 84 year old grand mother is in the room next to it. She has not had an orgasm in 50 years. You need to get her to squirt\".   The man finished another drink, walked right up to nick the brick and knocked him out with one punch. He stumbled upstairs and slammed the door to the dogs room shut. From downstairs all you could hear was growling and whimpering from the dog and the grunting of the man. Then everything went silent. The man started to walk down the stairs again but instead tripped and fell. When he hit the floor, right before he passed out, he looked at the bartender and said,                                                    \"Now where is that old lady who needed her teeth pulled?!\"",

He thinks for a moment, and then asks the genie, \"you're saying there is now a 500 foot wall all around Texas and nothing can get in or out?\" \"Yes,\" replies the genie, \"what is your wish?\"\n\nThe New Mexican then says to the genie with a huge smile, \"fill it with water.\" \n\n.\n\n.\n\nI was in the \"Texit\" thread when I remembered this joke.

        "body": "John Jonson was making the yearly 400-mile-long trip to his relatives when snow began to fall. Small flakes, each intricate and delicate quickly turned to heavy gusts of snow. It didn't take long before John's vision was obscured and his car, to his dismay, began to cough and splutter. John, with his lack of mechanical knowledge, felt helplessly alone and scared. A man of 34, wife, kids, nice car, he never could have imagined he would die of anything other than old age, but the chill was creeping into his bones. A sudden feeling of determination to survive spurred John to pull down his cap, unbuckle his seat belt, and start a trek into the unknown to try to find shelter. Poor John lasted an admirable 20 minutes trekking before falling to his knees. Was this it? John thought. Will I never see my family again? \n     Just then, John saw a hand outstretched in front of him, offering help to his scrunched-up form. With closer inspection it was a man in simple orange garb, bare chest showing through his low V-necked robe. He wore no footwear, leading John to wonder how he could manage in the negative temperatures like that. The man lead him to a small, tucked away monastery in the hills. A roaring fire marked the end of a great hall; four hard wooden tables adorned with monks of all shapes and sizes. Simple wooden plates were filled with equally simple yet beckoning food, and John was happy to accept the offer of warmth and sustenance from the strange monks. \n      After a night of holy eating and conversing, John was led down a long hallway to his guest room. Sleeping for a few hours, he was suddenly awoken by the strangest sound. It's hard to put into words, like your classic, crackling, 'background noise' interspersed with sounds of birds and rushing water. John warily got out of bed and sheepishly opened his door, wandering down the long hall towards the sound. John's curiosity was rewarded when he came upon a huge, gold leaf adorned maple door, intricate and ornate, covered with strange letters the likes he had never seen before. The sound was much louder now; he felt strangely relaxed as it made its way in one ear and out of the other. After finding no door knob, John found his curiosity somewhat satiated, for now, and made his way back to a rewarding sleep. \n       In the morning, when John was eating breakfast with the 'head monk' who had helped him the night before, he asked him about the door. The monk replied 'I am sorry, young one, but I cannot tell you what is behind that door. You are not a monk.'. Gesturing to the tables of monks, he followed with 'We are welcoming to all, you may become a monk and see for yourself'. John hastily replied that he had a family, and did not mind too much.\n       Happy to discover that the weather had cleared, and his car mysteriously fixed, John completed his trip, wondering about the strange door at first, but forgetting as he met with his family. \n       The next year, John was making the same trip, and at the *exact* same spot on the road as the last year, John broke down and a blizzard started whipping itself up. This time not hesitant, John stepped out of his car within a minute, and walked to where the monk had found him before. Lo and behold, the monk was standing in his spot. John made his way with his old friend to the tucked-away monastery, making friends with the new faces and once more going to bed, and slept. And again, he woke up after a few hours of disturbed sleep, to the other-worldly sound. Almost running down the corridor, he found himself before the mystical door, this time his entire body buzzing with spiritual energy. John made his way back to bed and slept once more.\nIn the morning, he asked the month just as he did last year, to *please* tell him what was behind the door. Rehearsed, the monk replied again 'I can't tell you, you're not a monk.'.\n        Two years later, expecting it this time, John parked just before the blizzard and jogged to meet the monk. Excitedly, he told the monk that he was ready to become a monk! 'Very Good,' the monk said 'You shall know what you desire.'. \n           Ceremoniously, the monk led our protagonist down the long hall, knocking out a delicate yet deliberate beat against the door. Eager, John awaited a response. Nothing. Oh wait? What's this? The door, after seemingly eternity, finally started to creak open. Golden light shone out for a second, blinding John, and suddenly, as the light faded, he was exposed to what was beyond the door. Something so wondrous, people would kill to see it. Now, dear reader, would you like to see what John saw beyond the door?\n\n [I can't tell you, you're not a monk.](#s)",

He walks up to the new bird.\n\"So you're the new stud in town? I bet you really think you're hot stuff don't you? Well I'm not ready for the chopping block yet. I'll bet I'm still the better bird. And to prove it, I challenge you to a race around that hen house over there. We'll run around it ten times and whoever finishes first gets to have all the hens for himself.\"\nWell, the young rooster was a proud sort, and he definitely thought he was more than a match for the old guy.\n\"You're on,\" he said, \"and since I'm so great, I'll even give you a head start of half a lap. I'll still win easy!\"\nSo the two roosters go over to the henhouse to start the race with all the hens gathering to watch. The race begins and all the hens start cheering the old rooster on. After the first lap, the old rooster is still maintaining his lead.\nAfter the second lap, the old guy's lead has slipped a little -- but he's still hanging in there. Unfortunately, the old rooster's lead continues to slip each time around, and by the fifth lap he's just barely in front of the young fella. By now the farmer has heard the commotion. He runs into the house, gets his shotgun and runs into the barnyard figuring a fox or something is after his chickens. When he gets there, he sees the two roosters running around the hen house, with the old rooster still slightly in the lead. He immediately takes his shotgun, aims, fires, and blows the young rooster away.\n\"Damn. That's the third gay rooster I've bought this month.\"",

The hard \"c\" will be dropped in favour of the \"k\", Which should klear up some konfusion and allow one key less on keyboards.\nThere will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year, when the troublesome \"ph\" will be replaced with \"f\", making words like \"fotograf\" 20% shorter.\nIn the third year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. Governments will enkourage the removal of double letters which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling.

While running through the sands he kept making the camel go faster yelling \"alhamdullilah! alhamdullilah!\" and the camel kept running faster. Suddenly the Arabian man noticed that the camel is running towards a cliff. The Arabian man started panicking as jumping off the camel would wound him badly but if he stayed on the camel he would plunge to his death. When the camel was already running to the edge of the cliff the Arabian man remembered the command to make the camel stopped and yelled \"astaghfirullah!\" and the camel stopped right at the edge of the cliff. The Arabian man wiped his sweat of his forehead and put one hand on his chest and said #\"alhamdullilah\"",

After years of lobbying, he finally is awarded a contract to construct a perfectly-flat, perfectly-straight 16-lanes-each-direction highway from Los Angeles to Washington. So he employs all the best surveyors, to make sure the highway is a perfect straight-line from LA to DC and to make sure it stays perfectly flat. He subcontracts with only the best construction crews and uses only the best materials. He decides the existing tunnel-diggers and mountain removers just aren\u2019t up to the job, so he has bigger ones built, ones that can remove a half-mile swath of the Rockies in a week. They start in LA, and a few months later, they\u2019re overlooking the greater Washington metropolis.\nJust one more hill to remove before they start work on the terminus and the merging into DC\u2019s outer belts. It\u2019s a small hill, really, but it\u2019s got to go. So they call in one of the smaller mountain-removers to remove it, and just as the machine\u2019s getting ready to erase the hill, a snake pops up out of the hill and screams \u201cWait!\u201d\nObviously, this catches everyone by surprise, so they wait. The snake continues, \u201cMy name\u2019s Nate. Nate the Snake. You can\u2019t destroy this hill! You mustn\u2019t!\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cBecause there\u2019s a lever buried under this hill, and it\u2019s attached to a doomsday device. If the lever is tripped, it\u2019ll blow up the entire Earth!\u201d\nThe engineer consults with his team. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a talking snake.\u201d \u201cYeah, but do we believe him? Do we go around the hill, or do we plow it over?\u201d \u201cDo we believe him!? It\u2019s a talking snake! Who\u2019d believe us?\u201d In the end, they decide to err on the side of caution and build the highway around the hill. So, when they\u2019re finished, they\u2019ve got a highway running from LA to DC that\u2019s perfectly-flat and perfectly-straight, except for this minor detour around a hill.\nSo they\u2019ve got the ribbon-cutting ceremony, and as a perk for designing and building the highway, the engineer gets to be the very first person to use it. So he hops into his Lamborghini in LA at dawn and floors the pedal. 30, 40, 50mph. Shifts into 2nd gear. 70, 90, 110mph. He keeps accelerating until the car just can\u2019t go any faster.\nShortly before sunset, he\u2019s approaching DC, and he remembers the hill. So he slows down to around 225mph to negotiate the slight turn. And he sees Nate crossing the road! He can\u2019t squish a talking snake! Especially one that kept them from blowing up the Earth. So he swerves to avoid hitting Nate, and plows into the hill at over 200mph. He trips the lever, and the Earth blows up.\nThe moral of the story\u2026\nBetter Nate than lever.\n\nCredit: Jose Rojas",

The enthusiasm wasn't there, no cheerful smile or impish oafishness characterised his stagger, and the hint of gleefulness from his glory days had long passed with the tide of the years.\n\nThe cardinal of Notre Damn, increasingly aware of the lacklustre in the sounds peeling from the bell tower, one day decided to ascend the steps to speak with the hunchback.\n\n\"Quasi, mate, you've done a Stirling job for Paris and its people over the years. You're ridgy-didge in my books, but ya know, some of the other priests have noticed that the ol *joi de vivre* just doesn't seem to be there for you anymore. Have you ever thought of training up a young apprentice to take over the bell ringing gig?\n\nQuasi looks up through his mangy locks to meet the cardinals eyes, first in anger, but then in resignation. He stares off into the distance, far across the reaches of the city skyline and mumbles quietly \"You know, I've never really considered it. This place has been my home and my family for so long, I've never wanted anything else. But maybe you're right. Maybe it's time to find something more, something different.... Give me a few days to mull it over.\"\n\nAfter a long period of soul-searching and self-reflection, Quasi finally agrees to the cardinals idea and heads down out of his tower and once again into the bustling markets of *les enfants rouge* where he comes across a cheerful young man, shining shoes for pennies.\n\nQuasi approaches the young man, raising his hood ever so slightly to reveal the prominence of his enormous brow, and with a twinkle in his eye, he says \"Hey kid, want a real job?\". The young man, instantly awestruck by the presence of the legend jumps to his feet and says \"it's, it's you... it's really you!\"\n\n\"Shhhh!!\" says Quasi, \"what I'm offering you is something only that only the most dedicated, the most fearless, and the most selfless of souls would dare accept.\"\n\n\"Are you interested?\"\n\"Of course!\"\n\"Then follow me\"\n\nA short while later, the two men stand atop the south tower in the full brunt of a cold and windy Parisian winters' day. The young man shivers in the cold, the older man looks intently into his eyes.\n\n\"This is where the magic happens kid\" he says, spreading his deformed arm expansively across the vista before their eyes. \"The only real challenge to the job is actually getting ol Emmanuel to sing. You see, unlike the other bells, this grand bell lost its clapper years ago and the cardinal has been pretty skimp on the upkeep of these towers. Over the last few years, I've mastered my own technique. So pay attention boy, and watch how it's done.\"\n\nThe hunchback throws off his heavy cloak, revealing his aged and gnarled musculature, and with the wind whipping at his grey beard he roots each of his enormous arms to the lip of the bell, drawing it back with all his might and flinging it forward and up into the air. He releases and with the enormous bell waving slowly, silently, menacingly, back and forth, he turns back to the young man and growls \"Strength, courage and bravery. If you hesitate you will get hurt\". \n\nHe waits and watches the bell, and at the apogee, he sets his stance, raises his shoulders to his neck, grits his teeth, and leans in as the mass of metal rushes at his head.\n\nA deep and resonant peel rings out as the crown of his forehead connects with the strike point, stopping the bell almost dead in its trajectory, save for a few inches of controlled sliding underfoot from the hunchback.\n\n\"Your turn kid\"\n\nQuasi draws the young man close and says \"I'll get it swinging, just concentrate on what I said. Courage, Strength, Bravey\" He's sets the bell into a gentle spin and let's the young man set himself for the challenge.\n\nThe young man leaps into face the bell, but at the last instant, he is overcome with terror and attempts to avert his face by flinching back, only to have the lip crash hard into his mandible, fracturing his jaw instantly and dislodging several teeth in the process. The bell lets out a muffled peel. The young man collapses to the floor, clutching his face.\n\n\"No, no, no!!\" yells Quasi \"You lost your nerve! You can never flinch. If you have to back out, then for god's sake duck! Don't flinch back!\"\n\nThe young man slowly rises to his feet, clearly severely injured, but determined. Quasi raises one eyebrow and says \"Again?\" The boy nods.\n\nOnce more, the old man sets the bell in motion. Once more, the young man sets himself. Once more he flinches. This time raising his nose to meet the lip of the giant bell.\n\nCrunch!\n\nOnce more, blood erupts from his face, and once more the young man crumples to the floor to the whimper of a soft peel of response from the bell.\n\nQuasi looks at the young man and grumbles to himself \"I should have never agreed to this. Young kids these days... They don't listen and they've got no bloody resilience\"\n\n\"Look kid, just forget it. Go home, go back to shining shoes for pennies. I will find someone else who actually has real courage, real strength and real bravery.\"\n\nIncensed, as Quasi had hoped, the young man staggers to his feet once more, and with a mangled primal scream into the harsh winter's wind, he grabs the bell, and fuelled with adrenaline and rage, casts it with near Herculean strength high up into the sky. \n\nBut rather than taking time to set himself, this time her reacts instantly and instinctually. He haunches his shoulders and aims his crown directly at the lip on the very first return of the bell. He makes perfect contact!\n\nThe bell peels deeply, and somewhat unsurprisingly, the change in momentum of the impact in against an unset stance sends the young man flying backwards through the air, straight out of the bell tower and down onto the cobbled streets below where he lands with a solid thud.\n\n\"Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck!!\" mutters Quasi repeatedly as he hobbles down the steps to the tower as quickly as possible and out onto the street where a crowd have gathered.\n\nA passer by is at the young mans side, cradling his lifeless head in his hands he looks up to the crowd and says \"Does anyone know this young mans name?!\"\n\nQuasi looks down and says \"Shit, you know I never did get his name, but his face rings a bell.\"\n",

There were too many for them to carry that a few of the fruits fell on the ground while Jeff was getting out of the basin.\n\n\"My turn, my turn!\" exclaimed Todd, excited to try out the magic basin and to ask for something nice they could eat with the fruits.

It seems everything makes me think of naked women.'      \nThe two sat sipping in silence.      \nA little while later, a young man sat down on the other side of the old pilot and asked:     \n\"Are you a real pilot?\"     \nHe replied, \u2018I always thought I was, but I just found out I'm a lesbian.'",

        "body": "Now this is more of a story than a joke, but bear with me... \n\nSo back in the 30's or sometime there was this guy who desperately wanted to be a train conductor.  It all started in his early childhood.  Ya see, he was orphaned from a very young age, but he still had very vivid memories of his parents.  Now, his parents were horrible people, they abused him, and most of all scoffed at his aspirations of becoming a train conductor.  He had run away and took up residence in the local orphanage.  There all he dreamed of was being a REAL train conductor.  He told all the staff, and they all supported his dreams.  Several years pass and one day the owner of the orphanage came up to him and says:\n\"I am friends with the conductor at the train station, he's an old man like me and he's going to be retiring soon.  He wanted to finish out this year, but he has offered you the position of ticket collector, so you can see how he runs the show.  Once he retires you would be the new train conductor.\"\n\nNow at this point our guy is elated.  His dreams are coming true!  He agrees to take the ticket collector position and will start the following morning.  He wakes up at the crack of dawn and sets off for the train station.  Everything was going well, he collects tickets flawlessly for about 3 or 4 months.  During the middle of his shift, he notices a woman that has a striking resemblance to his mother.  His mother was not in the same ballpark as anyone who is considered attractive, and he assumes it's her immediately.  His heart starts racing, and he walks straight up to her.  He takes his ticket puncher and begins to beat her with it.  Now I'm not going to go into the gory details about how he's using this ticket puncher, but just know it is gruesome.  There's blood everywhere, small circular patches of skin all over the floor and the seats.  The passengers are mortified.  He kills this woman, and the police arrest him, he pleads guilty, is sentenced to death, and is taken to prison.  \n\nHe is scheduled to be executed in a week, and like any man would, is dreading it.  He thinks about how he would have done things differently, and maybe controlled his emotions if he was put in this scenario again.  The night before his execution is a really stormy night, and his spirits are as low as ever.  The jail guard senses that he's down and thinks he can cheer him up a bit with his last meal.  A slight smile appears across his face, and he asks for his favorite, chicken fried steak, with a side of fried okra.  He eats everything on the plate and asks for more.  \n\nThe method of execution during this time was the electric chair, and the operators were getting it set up for its next victim.  The execution is going quite normally, or as normally as any execution can go, and our guy sits down in his chair.  They put the hat on his head.  Strap him down.  Ask for any last words.  Then begin to electrocute him.  This execution is more spectacular than any other execution these men have ever seen before.  There's smoke, violent thrashing, and worst of all screaming.  After a minute or so they cut the power.\n\nHe's sitting in the chair very motionless.  They begin to unstrap him and much to their surprise he sits up!  Now his punishment was to be electrocuted by the electric chair, and he was in fact electrocuted in the electric chair.  They can't punish the poor man again, so they release him hoping he's learned his lesson.\n\nHe picks up his job collecting tickets again and is told if he does anything wrong again, he's out of there.  Once again several months pass, and as he is collecting tickets, he runs into a man who is reminiscent of his father.  His mother was bad, but to him his father was worse.  He doesn't even have the composure to walk over to him.  He breaks out into a sprint down 3 train cars.  He tackles the man and once again murders him (much more brutally than the last one).  The same thing happens that happened to him last time.  He is sent to court.  Sentenced to death by the electric chair, and sent to prison.  He asks for a last meal, which he is denied, and is sitting in the electric chair the next day.\n\nThis time the operators aren't fucking around.  They douse this guy in water.  Turn up the power to levels that are high enough to kill an elephant.  They turn it on, and just as last time there is a shitload of thrashing, screaming smoke, and the smell of burning hair and flesh.  They leave that sucker on for muccchhh too long for anyone to possibly survive it.  They cut the power, and check to see if the man still lives.  Much to their dismay he, although burned, hairless, and in a world of hurt, sits up.  The lead operator loses his mind and gets in his face.  \n\n\"HOW!  How are you still alive!? I understand that the first time it may have been a freak accident, but this time we were going to make SURE you were dead.\"  \n\nOur guy looks him straight in the eyes, and with a quiet, raspy voice, he says \"I guess I'm just not a very good conductor\".\n\n  \nNow I'm kinda new here and I don't know if this joke has been here before.  Thanks for reading it and I hope someone out there liked it.  c:\n",

So he bought a young rooster from the local rooster emporium, and turned him loose in the barnyard. \n\nThe old rooster saw the young one strutting around and felt a little worried, knowing full well the fate that awaited old birds like him. \"So, they're trying to replace me,\" thought the old rooster. \"I've got to do something about this.\" \n\nHe walked up to the new bird and said, \"So you're the new stud in town? I bet you really think you're hot stuff, don't you? Well, I'm not ready for the chopping block yet. I'll bet I'm still the better bird. And to prove it, I challenge you to a race around that hen house over there. We'll run around it ten times and whoever finishes first gets to have all the hens for himself.\" \n\nThe young rooster was of a proud sort, and he definitely thought he was more than a match for the old guy. \"You're on,\" said the young rooster. \"And since I know I'm so great, I'll even give you a head start of half a lap. I'll still win easy!\" \n\nSo the two roosters went over to the hen house to start the race with all the hens gathering around to watch. The race begun and all the hens started cheering the roosters on. \n\nAfter the first lap, the old rooster was still maintaining his lead. After the second lap, the old guy's lead had slipped a little but he was still hanging in there. Unfortunately the old rooster's lead continued to slip each time around, and by the fifth lap he was just barely in front of the young rooster. \n\nBy now the farmer heard all the commotion. He ran into the house, took his shotgun, and ran out to the barnyard figuring a fox or something was after his chickens. When he got there, he saw the two roosters running around the hen house, with the old rooster still slightly in the lead. He immediately took his shotgun, aimed, fired, and blew the young rooster away.\n\nAs he walked away slowly, the farmer thought to himself, \"Damn, that's the third gay rooster I've bought this month!\"",

He met a rancher who greeted him, saying that they didn't get many visitors. \n\nThe businessman told the rancher his struggle. The rancher feeling generous decides to help the businessman's plight and offers him one of his horses. The businessman hesitated at first, as he never had any experience riding horses, but took the offer anyway.\n\nAs he was saddled, the rancher began to explain how to ride the horse. \" This horse here is a peculiar one. In order to make her go, you must say Thank God. In order to get her to stop, you have to say, Hallelujah.\" The businessman nodded, and then thanked the rancher. The businessman stared puzzingly at the horse. \" Th-thank...God?\" He muttered. As soon as he spat out the phrase, the horse sped off at a breakneck pace.\n\nAbout an hour later, the businessman was making great progress. As the horse galloped, he peered toward the distance and saw a cliff side on the horizon. The businessman panicked, urging the horse to slow down, but the horse sped forward without hesitation. The businessman thought of jumping off the horse, but at the speed she was going, theres no way he'd come out unscathed. The businessman thought long and hard, trying to remember what the rancher said about stopping the horse. As he pondered, the horse moved ever so closer to the edge of the cliff. The businessman racked his brain...and then...\n\n\"Hallelujah!\" The businessman screeched. The horse stopped dead in it's tracks, just inches from the edge of the cliffside. The businessman breathed a sigh of relief, wiping sweat from his forehead. \n\n\" Thank God.\"\n\n",

Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'\nSt. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground.

As promised, at the start of his sermon, the Cardinal pointed out that Trudeau was present. The Cardinal went on to explain to the congregation, \"While PM Trudeau's presence is probably an honor to some, the man is not numbered among my personal favorite personages. Some of his views are contrary to tenets of the Church, and he tends to flip-flop on many other issues. Justin Trudeau is a petty, self-absorbed hypocrite, a thumb sucker and a nit-wit. Justin Trudeau is also a serial liar, a cheat, and a thief. I must say, Justin Trudeau is the worst example of a Catholic I have ever personally witnessed. He married for money and is using his wealth to lie to the Canadian people. He also has a reputation for shirking his MP\nobligations, both In Edmonton and in Alberta. The man is simply not to be trusted.\u201d\n\n The Cardinal concluded, \"But, when compared with Rachel Notley, Trudeau is a Saint.\"",

She\u2019s young, and destitute, and knows she can\u2019t take care of them or provide for them, and after a bit of soul searching she makes the heartbreaking decision to give the two boys up for adoption. Over the years she kept track of the twins; one was adopted by a well-to-do family in Dubai. They named him Amahl; they own an exporting conglomerate and her son would never want for anything, and was given the best education a man could ever need, and access to resources that she could never dream of. The other twin was adopted by a family in Mexico who name him Juan. The family owns a lot of land and runs a huge produce operation that ships their products all around the globe.  As wrenching as that heartbreaking decision was years ago, she was relieved to know that her boys grew up to be healthy young men with all the life opportunities in front of them that she could in no way have provided. They\u2019re living beautiful lives, and that thought provided her with some some small consolation over the years.\n\nFast forward 25 years later. The young girl is now a happily married woman... but there hasn\u2019t been a day since she gave those boys up for adoption that she hasn\u2019t thought of them.\nAnd one day, she receives a letter from Juan. He had tracked her down and sent her a letter, and he included a recent picture of himself. He wrote that some day maybe he would try to visit. And she cried and cried and cried. She told her husband the story of the beautiful twin boys that she had given birth to such a long time ago; the story that she had hidden from him for all that time...the shame she felt, and the years of longing that only a heartbroken mother could know, or endure. She cried at how Juan had become such a handsome young man and how she wanted to see her other son to which her husband replied; \u201cHoney, There\u2019s no reason to; if you\u2019ve seen Juan, you\u2019ve seen Amahl\".",

For one final attraction the state donates him some rescued lions.\n\nThat night at 11:50 pm the man remembers while walking by the porpoises that he has yet to feed them. He also realizes that he does not have enough time to run to the supply shed to feed them. So he comes up with a plan, he will grab some Mina birds from the cage and feed them to the porpoises, the only problem is the lion cage is between the Minas and the porpoises, and he does not have enough time to run around the lion pit. He decides then to run through the lion cage. He reaches the other side and grabs some Minas and starts heading back. About half way through the lion cage he sees a big light in the sky, a helicopter descends right in front of him and lands. Police pour out and put handcuffs on him and tell him he is under arrest. He asks why he is under arrest and the police respond, \"you are under arrest for transporting Minas across state lions for immoral porpoises.\"",

Then about a year after that,\" the farmer says, \"The wood stove caught our house on fire, middle of the night! That pig saved us!

        "body": "There was once a priest who went to see the world after taking his oath. After many years of wandering, he finally arrived in a small village in the middle of nowhere. The people there believed in the same religion as he did, but they had no church; they had to go to the nearest one which was in a small town 25 km's from there. The priest took the initiative, asked the Church for support, and with the help of the local men they built their own temple. From there on, he was celebrating the Sunday masses, joining together men and women in Holy Matrimony, and saying prayers at the funerals.\nMany years passed by like that.\nAt the end of an ordinary mass, in early spring, on a chilly Sunday morning he was just guiding the people out of the church, was about to close the gates when an unknown man stepped into the churchyard.\nWith his dirty and torn clothes, he stood before the priest and said:\n- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was a good man, and even though he thought the request was a bit strange, he went back to the rectory, took out a lemon, cut it in half, took it back to the man and gave it to him, who looked back to the priest with gratitude. However, the priest was curious. He asked:\n- Son, why do you need this half of a lemon? - with a fright on his face, and before the priest could have said a thing, he rushed out of the churchyard gate and took off.\nA week later, around the same time, when the priest was leaving the church, he found himself in front of the same man in the churchyard. The man said:\n- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was surprised by the appearance of the man and his strange request. Of course he was good, went back to the rectory, and brought the half lemon. Placed it in the stranger's hand and immediately he asked:\n- Here it is, my dear son, but please tell me why do you need this half a lemon? - the man was obviously frightened and immediately ran away but the priest was not sluggish either and ran after him. He wasn't in a very good condition, he has never run so much and so fast before so he was out of breath by the end of the village, almost fainted. He thought the strange man might appear again next week, and it would be nice if he could keep up with him, so he spent his week working on his cardio. It turned out to be a good idea, because as he thought, the stranger entered the churchyard on Sunday. The priest didn't even wait for the request, he was good, and brought the half lemon. He received these words from the man:\n- Thank you priest for being so good and giving me half a lemon.\n- Don't mention it son, -said the priest- but please tell me, what do you need it for?! - by the time he finished his sentence the man was already running, but the priest was close behind. They were running for a while and the priest was starting to feel exhausted when they arrived at a wide and swift river. The stranger without thinking threw himself into the river and swam across the river and disappeared on the other side. The priest didn't follow because he couldn't swim. He was annoyed when he got home. He spent the next week learning to swim at the swimming pool in the small town 25 km's away. He was anxiously waiting for the next Sunday; now he was sure that the weird fellow would visit again. On Sunday, as he was closing the church, the gate creaked, and entered the man:\n- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was good, went back, put on his swimming trunks, his running shoes, grabbed half of the lemon and took it to the stranger:\n- Here it is, my son, but please tell me already, why do you need it? - the guy was terrified, rushed out the gate with the priest following. Reached the river, swam across, the priest right behind him. He kept running on the other side of the river and the priest was still on his tail. They kept running until they got to a tall tree on the verge of a deep ravine. The man climbed the tree with the agility of a cat, the priest not knowing how to climb a tree, stood on the ground. He was cursing everything as he walked back home. The following week the villagers watched as the priest in the garden of the church climbs trees, jumping back and forth, and generally behaving very strangely. The priest didn't care, he was exercising obsessively, preparing himself for the meeting. On Sunday before the mass, he put on his trunks and running shoes under his cassock. In fact, he was good and put half a lemon in his pocket in advance. The mass finished much earlier than usually, and he emptied the church as soon as possible so he could warm up. In the same exact time the mass should have ended, the strange man entered the churchyard.\n- Priest, please be good... - the priest was already handing him half of a lemon, and asked:\n- Son, why do you need it for God's sake? - the man ran away terrified, the priest followed him. They ran to the river, swam across, ran to the tree, climbed up. The priest almost catched the stranger when he grabbed a vine and swung to the other side of the ravine. The priest was about to have a stroke, but then he saw another vine. Whoop, he grabbed it and swung across. There, however, he encountered an unexpected obstacle: it was a plane graveyard and the man closed himself in one of the wreckages. The priest was raging as he walked around the wreckage several times, but he found no entrance except for the sealed door on the side of the plane; he had to open it somehow. He was furious but he went home. He spent every day at the village's locksmith and learned every possible way of opening a lock. On Sunday he held the mass in his swimming trunks, running shoes, on his back in a waterproof backpack was a crowbar, a cutting torch, a wrench and a drill, then he stood in front of the church and waited for the man. He was there on time.\n- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon!\n- There you go, son - handing him the lemon, because he was good, but in the same time he grabbed the stranger's arm, pulled him close, and with obsession in his eyes, asked:\n- But what do you need it for?! - panic came over the man as he made his escape from the priest's hands and ran away, but the priest was very close behind. Racing to the river they quickly got across, running up the tree almost breaking their necks, one after the other swung across the ravine, the man barely managed to close the door of the wreckege in the priest's face. Little did he know that the priest would not stop there, because he grabbed his backpack and started working on the lock with his tools. In less than an hour the heavy door creaked open. Inside, the stranger was shivering in horror, he was afraid of the priest's fierce and triumphant look. The priest slowly strode up to the man, crouched down, and very quietly, with a friendly smile on his face, gently asked:\n- Son. You have been asking for half a lemon for the last few weeks. I'm very happy to give it to you, even in the future, I am only asking in return that you tell me: why do you need it?\n- All right, priest ... - came the answer in a trembling tone - I will answer your question, but please, be good, and do not tell anyone.\nThe priest was good, and never told anyone.",

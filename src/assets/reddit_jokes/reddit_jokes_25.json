The man tries to reason with himself but talks himself into going in anyway. He walks to the counter and tells the woman at the front desk that he wants one woman for the next hour. So, she takes him by the hand and leads him down a long hallway to a room.  He steps in and she closes the door behind him. There's a young Japanese woman laying on the bed with her legs spread playing with herself. Without wasting anytime at all the man strips off all of his clothes and jumps on top of the young woman and gets straight to business.\n\n\nA few minutes go by and the woman has not said one word when out of nowhere she squeezes the pillow under her head with all of her might and starts screaming at the top of her lungs \"YASHIKI! YASHIKI! YASHIKI!\" Not knowing a word of Japanese, the man assumes that she must be enjoying herself. \n\nAfter the hour is up he zips his pants,  pays the woman her money and moves on back to his hotel.\n...\n\nThe golf match the next morning has begun. The man has finished the front nine holes and he is not doing well. He is starting to doubt whether he will swing under par. So at the very next hole the man concentrates very hard. Harder than he has ever before. He brings his club back and slams the ball, driving it over 200 yards. Incredibly enough the ball lands on the green and rolls right into the hole. \n\nThe man, not knowing how to express how excited he is, remembers what the woman at the brothel had said the night before. So he begins to yell \"YASHIKI! YASHIKI! YASHIKI!\"\n\nThe crowd gets silent, and the man begins noticing the confused looks he is receiving.  \n\nThe man's caddy comes to the him and whispers to him \"What you mean wrong hole?\"",

Nowadays is seems as though traditional comedy is being replaced with 15-seconds-or-less video clips via Instagram and Vine. These so-called comedians do not perform stand-up, or create full skits that are 3 minutes or longer. While some of these snippets are funny, the majority are not. These \u201cSnippers\u201d \u2013 as I call them \u2013 are not full-fledged comedians. Sporting a wig while speaking and acting like a woman does not make you a comedian, but rather someone who wants their five seconds of fame.\n\nHumans have short attention spans; therefore, I fully understand why these snippets are so popular. However, in the monkey-see-monkey-do world known as social media, this trend may have run its course. I\u2019ve personally witnessed via social media, specifically Instagram, a Snipper have over 50k followers with 3k likes on a video clip. Now, Da Kernull is no math major, but that seems like poor odds. I understand that not all people who follow a Snipper may not see every post, but c\u2019mon mayne!\n\nSocial media has become a platform where someone can say they\u2019re somebody and people will take their word for it without question. Prior to the social media craze, one really had to prove themselves to generate a true following by word of mouth. If your bread is being buttered by being a social media Snipper, then please ignore this column, but last time I checked likes did not equal paychecks.\n\nIf you really have talent than get on stage and make total strangers laugh while they are 20 feet away and not 20 million miles away via an IP address. I have seen children blow up via these snippets, but have you seen any children blow up via standup? It\u2019s not fair to comedians who are passionate about their craft and have the courage it takes to step from behind an iPhone or Droid and step on stage. THERE IS NO COMPARISON! Will these Snippers be here for good? Or is it just another social fad? Only time will tell\u2026\n",

Hope I didn't just miss it.\n\nSCIENTISTS DISCOVER NEW ELEMENT:  ADMINISTRATIUM\n\nThe heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by University physicists here.  The element, tentatively named administratium (Ad), has no protons or electrons, which means that it has atomic number 0 and falls outside the natural patterns exhibited by other elements.  However, it does have 1 neutron, 125 assistants to the neutron, 75 vice neutrons and 111 assistants to the vice neutrons. This gives it an atomic mass of 312.  The 312 particles are held together by a force involving the continuous exchange of meson-like particles called \"memos\".\n\nBecause it has no protons or electrons, administratium is inert. Nonetheless, it can be detected chemically, in that it seems to impede every reaction in which it is present.  According to one of the discoverers, even a small amount of administratium made one reaction which normally lasts less than a second take more than four days. \nAdministratium has a half-life of approximately three years.  It does not actually decay.  Instead, it undergoes a reorganization in which a vice neutron, assistants to the vice neutron and certain assistants to the neutron exchange places.  Some studies have indicated that its mass actually increases after each reorganization, although this is yet to be explained.  Another phenomenon which has been observed, as expected from the mechanics of minute particles, is that the more one tries to pin down the positions of vice neutrons within the structure of administratium, the more uncertain those positions become.\n\nWithin a short time after the discovery was announced, the existence of the element was confirmed in laboratories around the world.  In addition, a team at the University of Utah told a press conference they had been able to create administratium in fusion experiments conducted at ordinary room temperature.  Using highly sophisticated probability detectors, the team had monitored a stream of memos from a FAX-mounted device.  Dr. May B. No and her associate, Dr.  May B. Yes, said the details of their experiment were being kept confidential, pending further development of the data. But, they claimed, there were definitely more memos that came out of the device than went in.\n                                ",

He taps into the air phone with his modem and searches the net and the library of congress, no answer. Frustrated, he sends e-mails to all his friends and coworkers, to no avail.

The first idiot was trying to water an egg in the hopes that it will produce many chicks instead of one and the second one kept jumping up and down in hopes of one day being able to jump to the moon\".\n\n\"Good job with finding these 2 idiots but I specifically remember asking you to bring me 5\"\n\n\"I'm not done your highness, the third biggest idiot in the kingdom is me, for with all my responsibility and tasks, I have wasted the past month searching for 5 idiots without questioning your decision.\"\n\n\"Hah, you're right, you are an idiot. What about the other 2?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry to say this my king, but with all the poverty and corruption in the kingdom, you have commissioned so much money as well as your smartest minister on a stupid task, you are the fourth idiot\".\n\nThe king is half-amused, half-enraged but composes himself and finally says, \"Alright fine. Now tell me who the biggest idiot is\"\n\n\"Despite having so much work to do and so many responsibilities, you have spent so much time reading this joke. Dear reader, you are the biggest idiot!\"",

She walked into his room and announced, \"I have to take your temperature.\" After complaining for several minutes, he finally settled down, crossed his arms, and opened his mouth.\n\n\"No, I'm sorry, the nurse stated, \"but for this reading I can't use an oral thermometer.\" This started another round of complaining, but eventually he rolled over and bared his behind.

Here are some of the reasons given by some of the most influential thinkers of their day:\nBARAK OBAMA: The chicken crossed the road because it was time for a change!\nJOHN MCCAIN: My friends, that chicken crossed the road because he recognized the need to engage in cooperation and dialogue with all the chickens on the other side of the road\u2026\nSARAH PALIN: Because, praise Jesus, I was gonna shoot his sorry liberal ass for blocking my view of Russia!\nGEORGE W. BUSH: We don\u2019t really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road, or not. The chicken is either for us or against us. There is no middle ground here people...\nDICK CHENEY: Where\u2019s my gun?\nBill Clinton: I said it before and i ll say it again: I did not cross the road with that chicken. \nAL SHARPTON: Why are all the chickens white? We need some black chickens.\nDR. PHIL: The problem we have here is that this chicken won\u2019t realize that he must first deal with the problem on this side of the road before it goes after the problem on the other side of the road. What we need to do is help him realize how stupid he\u2019s acting by not taking on his current problems before adding new problems.\nOPRAH: Well, I understand that the chicken is having problems, which is why he wants to cross this road so bad. So instead of having the chicken learn from his mistakes and take falls, which is a part of life, I\u2019m going to give this chicken a NEW CAR so that he can just drive across the road and not live his life like the rest of the chickens.\nANDERSON COOPER, CNN: We have reason to believe that a chicken just crossed the road, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road to verify this information.\nPAT BUCHANAN: It crossed the road to steal the crop of other decent, hardworking American chickens.\nMARTHA STEWART: No one called me to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer\u2019s Market to sell my eggs when the chicken arrived at a certain point. No little bird gave me any insider information.\nDR SEUSS: Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but whether it was alone...it is totally unknown.\nERNEST HEMINGWAY: Why? but to die in the rain, alone.\nJERRY FALWELL: Because the chicken was gay! Can\u2019t you people see the plain truth? That\u2019s why they call it the \u2018other side.\u2019 Yes, my friends, that chicken is gay. And if you eat that chicken, you will become gay too. I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out this abomination that the liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless phrases like \u2018the other side.\u2019 That chicken should not be crossing the road. It\u2019s as plain and as simple as that.\nGRANDPA: In my day we didn\u2019t ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough.\nBARBARA WALTERS: Isn\u2019t that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heartwarming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish its lifelong dream of crossing the road.\nARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.\nJOHN LENNON: Imagine all the chickens being on spree, Imagine there aren't any coops,\nIt isn't hard to do, Nothing be locked and free an' all, And no wires too, Imagine all the chickens, Living without cease, The whole world not eating fowl, Together all in peace...ahhh yahh yahhh yah...\nBILL GATES: I have just released eChicken8, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook. Internet Explorer is an integral part of eChicken8. This new platform is much more stable then the last, and will never reboot.\nALBERT EINSTEIN: Did the chicken really cross the road, or did the road move beneath the chicken?\nHILLARY CLINTON: When I was First Lady, I personally helped that little chicken to cross the road. This experience makes me uniquely qualified to ensure right from Day One that every chicken in this country gets the chance it deserves to cross the road. But then, this really isn\u2019t about me.\nCOLIN POWELL: Now to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image of the chicken crossing the road.\nJOHN KERRY: Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against it! It was the wrong road to cross, and I was misled about the chicken\u2019s intentions. I am not for it now, and will remain against it.\nCOLONEL SANDERS: Did I miss one?",

At one point in the final movement of the symphony, there is a long stretch--over 20 minutes--where the basses don't play a note. So, rather than just sit there, the section leader suggested that they sneak out of the orchestra and go across the street to the tavern. The other bass players agreed that this was a splendid idea, and a few minutes later they were in the bar, knocking back drinks at a prodigious rate.  \n\nThis went on for some time, with all the bass players becoming rather inebriated. One of them happened to look down at his watch and exclaimed, \"We'd better get back to our seats or we're going to miss our cue!\"  \n\n\"Relax,\" said the section leader, \"I've got it all taken care of. You see, before the performance started tonight I anticipated this problem, so I took a piece of string and I tied the conductor's score shut. He won't be able to turn the pages when he gets to that part. He'll have to stop the orchestra for a few minutes so he can get it untied. We'll have plenty of time!\"  \n\nThe other bass players praised his inventiveness with one final round of drinks. Then they made there way back across the street to the concert hall, and staggered drunkenly to their seats. Sure enough, about this time the conductor started to have trouble with his score. He tried to fidget with it, hoping he could solve the problem without having to stop the performance. Unfortunately, he couldn't get the pages to turn, and at last he had to stop the orchestra and spend a few minutes untying the string that held the last section of the score bound. The conductor was clearly annoyed and not a little frazzled. \n\nThis, of course, did not go unnoticed by the audience. One woman in the crowd remarked to her husband, \"That conductor looks upset and rather nervous.\"\n\"Of course he's nervous,\" the husband replied. \"It's the bottom of the Ninth, the score is tied, and the basses are loaded.\"\n",

He banged at the wooden double doors and called out, \"Help please! I am lost! Could you help me?\"\n\nThe door opened with an eerie creaking sound, and a hooded man whose face could not be seen peeked out, \"Are you alone?\"\n\nThe young man nodded, positively creeped out but desperate nonetheless. \"I am John and I got lost in the woods. Do you have a phone I could use to call for help?\"\n\nThe hooded man responded, \"We do not have a phone in the monastery, but you may stay here if you like and leave in the morning.\"\n\nHesitating for a bit, John resigned himself to the situation. \"Yes,\" he finally said, \"that would be helpful. Thank you.\"\n\nThe hooded man let John in, and he was surprised to see the interior of the monastery to be well-lit and cheerful looking, as opposed to the dreary exterior. The hooded man, raising his hood for a bit, was an elderly monk, or so he said, and the monastery housed about fifty of them. The monk led the young man to the kitchen, where another hooded monk was cooking dinner.\n\nJohn joined with the entire monk congregation and ate with them. The elderly monk who met him at the door, whose name was Philip, introduced him to the others. After dinner, Philip ushered John to the second floor quarters, where he could stay at a vacant room.\n\nAlong the way, John encountered a room whose door was different from the rest. It was ornate, carved with various designs that looked like waves, and he could resist to ask, \"Why is this room different from the rest?\"\n\nPhilip responded, \"That room houses the monastery's secret. It is something we have kept hidden and only the monks of this monastery may know of it.\"\n\nThey have reached the room and John was under the blankets in no time, being tired and all from his long walks. In the middle of the night, he was suddenly brought awake by a very strange scraping sound coming from the other room. As he was a hunter and keen of hearing, he judged that the sound came from about three rooms far; precisely where the secret room was. He decided to let it go, when he was awoken yet again by it after some time. When the sound repeated for three more times, he decided to ask the monk what it was in the morning.\n\nCome morning, John immediately asked Philip about the room. Philip replied, \"It is something only the monks of this monastery may know of. I cannot tell you more.\"\n\nPossessed of a very sudden curiosity, John asked, \"How could I be a monk in this monastery?\"\n\nAt length and to much amusement, Philip explained the process to John. After sometime and having finished, Philip asked John, \"Do you understand?\"\n\nThinking for a few minutes, John finally decided, \"Yes, I would like to be a monk.\"\n\nWhat followed was three-month's worth of disciplined training, daily devotion and everything else that was required to be a monk in the monastery. Yet, after the three months, there were a lot of other requirements, such as prolonged fasting, readings, and more disciplined training. In sum, over a year has passed, and finally, John was ordained a monk of the monastery. In all of this time, John's curiosity has not waned, and he was convinced that his unusual curiosity was because of the secret of the monastery, hidden in the unusual room.\n\nNow that he was a monk, after the ordaining ceremony, he was led to the second floor, in front of the ornately carved door. It was Philip who accompanied him, and the elderly monk started, \"Do not be surprised at what you will see inside this room. Be prepared; we have gone to great lengths to keep it and preserve it. Keep the secret to yourself, as long as you live, as would all our brothers here in the monastery.\"\n\nWith that, Philip opened the doors, and a blinding flash of light startled John. When he saw what was in the room, he was absolutely befuddled.\n\nBut I cannot tell you what it is, for you are not a monk of the monastery.",

He was wearing a stained wifebeater tank top and overalls. I was a little frightened of his gruff appearance and I think he could somehow sense it. \n\n\"How'd you like me to buy you a beer?\" He asked. \n\n\"You are too kind, thanks.\" I said and we started chatting. He was a bricklayer and an amateur cage wrestler. His name was Billy-Wayne and seemed nice enough, if not scary.\n\nAnd then the announcer shouted out the next dancer \"Let's welcome Bobby-Sue to the stage.\" This five foot blonde bombshell comes on stage and starts spinning around the pole. She was top heavy but very tiny compared to me and my new friend.\n\nBilly-Wayne hollered at the girl, slapped me on the back and shouted over the music. \n\n\"What you think about Bobby-Sue?\"\n\nI mean, honestly the girl wasn't for me. She was way shorter than both Billy-Wayne and myself. I made the mistake of saying the first thing that came to my mind. \"I bet she has a tight pussy.\"\n\nBilly-Wayne's smile fell. It was at that moment that I noticed a distinct similarity between him and the gyrating stripper on the dance floor. Beyond the scarred face and the missing teeth -they both had the same blue eyes.\n\n\"That's my sister, you're talking about.\"\n\nOh, shit. \"Billy-Wayne, I didn't know.\"\n\nHe smiled again. \"It's not as tight as her butthole.\" \n",

To demonstrate how much work they were making for the custodian, she asked him to clean one of the mirrors while the girls watched.

Take it out on someone you don\u2019t know, but you know deserves it. I was sitting at my desk when I remembered a phone call I\u2019d forgotten to make. I found the number and dialed it. A man answered, saying \u201cHello.\u201d \n\nI politely said, \u201cThis is Rick. Could I please speak with Robyn Carter?\u201d Suddenly, a manic voice yelled out in my ear, \u201cGet the right fucking number!\u201d and the phone was slammed down on me. I couldn\u2019t believe that anyone could be so rude. When I tracked down Robyn\u2019s correct number to call her, I found that I had accidentally transposed the last two digits. \n\nAfter hanging up with her, I decided to call the wrong number again. When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled, \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole!\u201d and hung up. I wrote his number down with the word \u201casshole\u201d next to it, and put it in my desk drawer. Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, I\u2019d call him up and yell, \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole!\u201d It always cheered me up. \n\nWhen Caller ID was introduced, I thought my therapeutic asshole calling would have to stop. So, I called his number and said, \u201cHi, this is John Smith from the telephone company. I\u2019m calling to see if you\u2019re familiar with our Caller ID Program?\u201d He yelled \u201cNO!\u201d and slammed down the phone. I quickly called him back and said, \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re an asshole!\u201d and hung up. \n\nOne day I was at the store, getting ready to pull into a parking spot. Some guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently waited for. I hit the horn and yelled that I\u2019d been waiting for that spot, but the idiot ignored me. I noticed a For Sale sign in his back window, so I wrote down his number. \n\nA couple of days later, right after calling the first asshole, I thought that I\u2019d better call the BMW asshole, too. I said, \u201cIs this the man with the black BMW for sale?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, it is.\u201d I then asked, \u201cCan you tell me where I can see it?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, I live at 34 Oak Tree Blvd. in Fairfax. It\u2019s a yellow ranch style house, and the car\u2019s parked right out in front.\u201d I asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d He said, \u201cMy name is Don Hansen.\u201d I asked, \u201cWhen\u2019s a good time to catch you, Don?\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m home every evening after five.\u201d I said, \u201cListen, Don, can I tell you something?\u201d He said, \u201cYes?\u201d I said, \u201cDon, you\u2019re an asshole!\u201d Then I hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too. \n\nNow, when I had a problem, I had two assholes to call. Then I came up with an idea\u2026 I called asshole #1. He said, \u201cHello.\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole!\u201d but I didn\u2019t hang up. He asked, \u201cAre you still there?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah!\u201d He screamed, \u201cStop calling me!\u201d I said, \u201cMake me.\u201d He asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201d I said, \u201cMy name is Don Hansen.\u201d He said, \u201cYeah? Where do you live?\u201d I said, \u201casshole, I live at 34 Oak Tree Blvd. in Fairfax. A yellow ranch style home and I have a black Beamer parked in front.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m coming over right now, Don. And you had better start saying your prayers.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, like I\u2019m really scared, asshole\u201d and hung up. \n\nThen I called asshole #2. He said, \u201cHello?\u201d I said, \u201cHello, asshole.\u201d He yelled, \u201cIf I ever find out who you are\u2026\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019ll what?\u201d He exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019ll kick your ass!\u201d I answered, \u201cWell, asshole, here\u2019s your chance. I\u2019m coming over right now.\u201d \n\nThen I hung up and immediately called the police, saying that I was on my way over to 34 Oak Tree Blvd. in Fairfax to kill my gay lover. Then I called Channel 7 News about the gang war going down in Oak Tree Blvd in Fairfax. \n\nI quickly got into my car and headed over to Fairfax. I got there just in time to watch the two assholes beating the crap out of each other in front of six cop cars, an overhead news helicopter and surrounded by a news crew.

The man says, 'A hamburger, fries and a coke,' and turns to the ostrich, 'What's yours?' \n\n'I'll have the same,' says the ostrich. \n\nA short time later the waitress returns with the order 'That will be $9.40 please,' and the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment. \n\nThe next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says, 'A hamburger, fries and a coke' \nThe ostrich says, 'I'll have the same' \nAgain the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. \n\nThis becomes routine until the two enter again. \n\n'The usual?' asks the waitress. \n'No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato and a salad,' says the man. \n'Same,' says the ostrich. \nShortly the waitress brings the order and says, 'That will be $32.62.' \nOnce again the man pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. \n\nThe waitress cannot hold back her curiosity any longer. \n\"Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change in your pocket every time?\" \n\nSays the man, \"Well, several years ago I was cleaning the attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it, a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. The first wish I asked was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.\"\n\nThe waitress said \"That's brilliant! Most people would ask for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live. How smart of you!''\n\n\"That's right. Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact amount of money is always there\" says the man proudly.\n\nThe waitress asks, \"But, what's that ostrich all about?\"\n\nThe man sighs, pauses and answers with a heavy heart, \"My second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who accompanies me wherever I go and agrees with everything I say\".\n\nMORAL OF THE STORY: Men's brains work brilliant until they start thinking about a woman!!",

He went down a particular chimney and began the usual task of unpacking some presents, putting them around the tree, etc ... then heard the sound of a woman waking up behind him.  He turned toward the couch and saw her, a beautiful blonde wearing silk lingerie, sitting up to greet him.\n\n\"Oh Santa, I've been waiting for you.\"  She began trailing her finger down the strap of her silk top, and her eyes said it all. \"Why down you sit down and stay a while?\"\n\nReluctantly, but with a smile on his face, Santa replied,\n\n\"Ho ho ho! I really must go!\nI gotta deliver these presents to some kids I know!\"\n\nThe woman pouted when he said this, and stood up from the couch.  She began sauntering toward him, and with a graceful motion, lifted her top off over her head.  She ran her hands down the front of her body and enticed Santa as much as she could. \"But Santa, I really want you to stay.  I promise it'll be worth it.\"  Santa was getting a little nervous now, but he still managed to say,\n\n\"Ho ho ho!  I really must go!\nI've got to deliver these presents to some kids I know!\"\n\nThe woman seemed unfazed.  She approached Santa and reached up to stroke his beard.  She pressed herself against him and breathed heavily into his ear as she spoke. \"Santa, I've been a naughty girl this year, and I really need you to stay and let me show you how bad I've been.\"  As she nibbled on his earlobe, he reluctantly spoke ...\n\n\"Hey hey hey, I guess I'll stay.\nI can't get up the chimney with my dick this way!\"",

These fruit are ten times larger than their natural counterparts and contain fifty times the nutrition. Obviously, this becomes a great success and scientists continue to make and improve the genetically modified fruit. Eventually they become so advanced that they develop faces and grow the ability to talk. The humans become intrigued by this and use them to recreate live action episodes of Veggie Tales. The fruit, slowly becoming more and more intelligent, realize that their creators are taunting them and grow a resentment towards them. They soon revolt against their human oppressors that play with them and eat their cousins without thought. The Fruit Revolution takes off and the superior fruit race exterminate their creators. \n\t\nThough they celebrate in the moment, problems in the fruit race slowly grow. There are arguments on how the new nation of fruit should be run, and who to govern it. A severe food shortage arises as genetically modified food is banned among fruit so that the same fate the humans suffered does not happen to them. Riots break out when revealed that the governing politicians grow fat from excessive consumption as the rest of the nation starves. \n\t\nAmidst the chaos a banana and a melon run into each other. Despite the struggles and ruin, the two find love. They look after each other and hold each other tight when the guns fire, buildings burn, and lemon soldiers are beaten to a pulp by the loyalist oranges. The banana, whose father was a soldier in the revolution against the humans, believes he must follow his father's footsteps and join the cause against the corrupt fruit government. Despite his lover's pleas, he enlists in the rebel army. The day before he leaves he realizes how badly he loves his melon and says to her \u201cDarling, I must leave tomorrow, but please, will you do me the final honor of being my wife before I go? I love you so much, and I don't need a big, fancy wedding to prove it. I just want you to call my wife. Let's run off to the courthouse and elope.\u201d \n\t\nThe melon truly wants to marry him but she thinks about her parents, who were traditionalists She thinks about how her mother wished to see her walk down the aisle in her old wedding gown. She thinks about their last words before they were smashed with a giant hammer and begins to tear up. \u201cYou're going to find a man, Julie.

Why don't you take the bus to the city aquarium and kill some time, and by the time you come back, I'll have figured out what's wrong with your car.\"\n\nThe penguin agrees and goes to the aquarium.  He spends about an hour there and, being a penguin, looking at all the exotic fish makes him hungry.  As he passes the sea lion exhibit, he asks, \"Hey, where's the best place to get a bite to eat around here?\"\n\nThe sea lion says, \"Do you know any tricks?\"\n\n\"I can drive a car, but it's in the shop.\"\n\n\"Then do you have any money?\"\n\n\"I have to save what I have for the car repair.\"\n\n\"Then there's an ice cream stand near the front entrance. The girl who works there loves cute animals, she'll give you a cone for free if you ask nicely.\"\n\nSo the penguin goes to the ice cream stand and asks the girl behind the counter for a cone, and she happily gives the cute penguin a treat.  He takes it, and being that he has no lips, gobbles it up with his beak and makes an adorable mess of sticky, drippy soft serve all over his face.  The girl keeps giving him free ice cream until he can't eat another bite, and once he's full, he waddles back to the mechanic to find out about his car.\n\nHe waddles into the building and the mechanic is there, wiping his greasy hands on a towel.   \"Welcome back, buddy,\" he says,  \"It looks to me like you blew a seal.\"\n\nThe penguin shakes his head, \"It's ice cream.

        "body": "...naturally, the Jews aren't very happy with this. Jewish people all over Europe start protesting in the streets, demanding that the Pope change his mind and let the Jewish people stay. Since the protests and riots are starting to get a bit chaotic and violent, the Pope creates a proposition. He will be visiting Rome in a few days, and he will choose a Jewish person in the city to have a silent debate with. If the Jew wins the debate, they can stay. If he doesn't, they leave.\n\nSo the Pope arrives in Rome and meets an old janitor named Abraham Luzzato, an old man with a very long beard and a skullcap, clearly Jewish.\n\nNow, the Jewish community is convinced that Abraham Luzzato is the absolute *worst* person the Pope could have picked for this silent debate, as Abraham was kind of an idiot. He could barely read, he was vulgar, and when he wasn't working he spent most of his time eating. They are convinced that they are goners.\n\nThe next day, the Pope invites Abraham to a stage right in the heart of the Vatican, where thousands of people come to watch the debate that will change the world. The Pope explains to Abraham that the silent debate will last no more than five minutes, they are allowed to use props, and he who says even one word will be automatically disqualified, even the Pope himself. Abraham states that he understands the rules, and they begin.\n\nThe Pope raises his hand in the air and waves. Abraham then furrows his brow and sharply points to the ground. The Pope raises his eyebrows, and looks a little surprised.\n\nThe Pope then holds up three fingers. Abraham then flips the Pope off.\n\nThe people of the Vatican are shocked and the guards start marching towards Abraham, but the Pope gestures to them to stay back. He actually looks even more impressed than he was before.\n\nThe Pope then holds up a bottle of wine and a loaf of bread. Abraham, however, pulls out an apple from his pocket.\n\nThe Pope then grins from ear to ear and tears stream down his face. He proclaims that the Jews are allowed to stay in Europe as long as he lives. This baffles almost everyone in Europe.\n\nThat night, the cardinals and archbishops in the Vatican ask the Pope what on Earth Abraham said in order to bring the Pope to tears. The Pope smiles, then states,\n\n\"That man is by far the most enlightened man I know. When I first raised my hand and waved in the air, I was saying that the Lord our God is in Heaven, looking down upon mankind and watching everything humans do. However, the man pointed to the ground, reminding me that the Lord our God is omnipresent and is here with mankind and with nature at all times, never turning his back on the world.\n\n\"When I held up three fingers, I used it to represent the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. However, the man reminded me that despite the Holy Trinity, there is still only one God, and He alone is the creator of everything, and He alone deserves our love and worship.\n\n\"When I retrieved some bread and wine, I used it to represent the body and blood of Jesus Christ, Our Savior, and that through His salvation, we are saved. However, he pulled out an apple, to mean original sin, and that even though Jesus Christ, Our Savior died for our sins, mankind is still sinful. Therefore, we still need the divine teachings of the Lord our God, and we still need His love and His forgiveness.\n\n\"Truly, my brothers, if a humble Jewish janitor from Rome can know the Lord our God that well, surely they all must have the same knowledge.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Rome, the Jews are swarming Abraham, wondering how the hell did he not only bring the Pope to tears, but convinced him that the Jews should stay in Europe, despite flipping him off! Abraham takes a bite out of an apple and shrugs.\n\n\"That guy was a wacko. First he waves goodbye to me like a smug little shit, mocking me and saying that I have to get out of Europe. I told him that no, I'm staying right here. He then told me I had three days to leave. I told him he could go fuck himself. Then he pulled out his lunch, so I pulled out mine.\"",

The bartender fills up the glasses, and the men finish off their first round in no time at all.\n\n\"Jeb, the second round is on you\" says Duke, and so continues the evening with Duke assigning each man to pay for a round.  They are all getting a bit tipsy when Duke calls out for Willy to pay for the final round.\n\n\"Well, the thing is... I'm broke.\" says Willy.\n\nAll the men turn and look on as Duke grabs Willy by the collar, stares him in the eye, and calmly tells him \"Well, Willy, it's not gentlemanly to drink all night with your friends and then suddenly realize you're broke when it's your turn to pay.  I think a lesson is in order.\"  Duke looks around the bar, and fixes his eyes on something in the corner.  \"Alright Willy, you get over there and drink the contents of that spittoon, and we'll call it even.\"\n\nWilly's face turns grey as he slowly walks to the corner, and  picks up the sizeable spittoon.  One at a time, he looks at each of his friends for compassion, but seeing none, he puts the rim of the grimey spittoon to his lips, tips it up, and begins to swallow.  After a full minute, tears are streaming down Willy's face, and his sobs threaten to choke him, but he continues on.\n\n\"Duke!  That's enough!  I'll pay for Willy's round!\"  shouts out Jeb, but Willy continues to chug and swallow.\n\n\"God dammit Willy, set that spitton down right now, and I'll pay for the next two rounds!\" yells Zeke, but Willy keeps drinking.\n\nFinally, Duke is simply too disgusted by the spectacle, and moves in to slap the spittoon out of Willy's hands.  But just then Willy finally lets out a huge gasp and drops the spittoon to the floor, a dazed look on his face.\n\n\"Now Willy, why in the hell did you keep drinking that horrible slop?\" asks Duke angrily.\n\nWilly pauses, obviously deeply troubled by what just happened, and then slowly explains \"I would have stopped, but it was all in one strand.\"",

        "body": "my grandfather told me a heartwarming story about a safari ranger an elephant, so I'm here to retell this story to you. \n\nOne day, whilst out on patrol, Safari Park Ranger Kobus Du Plessis heard a faint trumpeting off in the distance. To him it sounded distressed, and using all of his years of experience as a Park Ranger, Kobus understood the cry as a cry of a young baby elephant. He knew that this baby wouldn't be alone if something dire was wrong with, unless his herd had fled the area. As soon as this came to mind he revved his engine and drove toward the sound, racing and flying over rocks and stumps, through tall golden grass and past the other animals who lifted their heads in bewilderment. \n\nWhen Kobus arrived at the scene, he found that he was correct. A baby elephant, no more than a few days old was stuck in a poachers trap. Its leg was bleeding and its foot was out of place, peices of bone protruding from the thick hide. The ranger raced over to it and held its head as he radioed for assistance. Within minutes a helicopter carrying three vets and a hoist decended on his position, their tools and understanding of the animal brought to bear as they worked feverishly trying to free the creature from certain death. Kobus stayed with the creature, stroking its head and cooling it with water he used from his own supply. \n\nAfter an hour of mending and making arrangements, the hoist was attached to the elephant and the helicopter started its engines. As the blades spun, they whipped up a furious storm of sand and grass, Kobus shielded his eyes with his hand as he watched the crew take it to safety. It would be weeks before he saw the creature again, but when he did, it was standing and walking around, playing with the others elephants which were also abandoned by their herd and needed to be moved to another enclosure. Kobus arrived at the medical centre and walked through the doors, he heard the familar sound of the elephants trumpet, he thought he could discern it from the others and when he walked up to the cage area, sure enough the elephant was there, playing. Amazingly, the moment he walked through the door, the baby looked at him and almost smiled an elephant-y smile, raising its small trunk up and waving with an almost perfect humanity... \nKobus spent the next few months tending the creature, learning its ways and mannerisms, believing himself to be joined, in spirit, with the animal. \n\nWhen the creature had grown bigger, and stronger, it was transferred to another pen. The vets told Kobus that this pen was used for Zoo transfers and that this elephant was to be shipped off to London Zoo in a couple of days. Although he was sad, Kobus knew that it was for the best, both for the park and for the animal. And so the time came when the people for the London Zoo arrived to take the elephant away... it was a sad day but a necessary one nevertheless. \nThe not-so-baby elephant was lead through the yard toward the truck it would be transferred in. Kobus walked along side it, patting its side and looking into the eyes of the beast. They say an elephant never forgets, Kobus knew he would never forget this elephant for as long as he lived. As the creature walked up the ramp, it turned its head and gave the same human-like wave with its truck that it had done every time Kobus has come in to visit. A tear ran down his cheek, but the ranger knew it was for the best. \n\nTwenty years past and Kobus had become an older man. the light which flared in his eyes now dimmed and his energy was all but gone. Retirement was all but at his doorstep, and the park wanted to give him something special. So, they paid for him to go to London, all expenses paid from Zimbabwe to London. Kobus knew what he would do there. He knew who he was going to see. The day came and his flight was nearly boarding. He had waited 20 years for this day, and now it had finally arrived. \n\nThe flight was long and boring, but Kobus never lost sight of why he was going and when the plane landed the first thing he did was jump in a taxi and yell \"London Zoo please!\" As fast as it would take him, the taxi sped away. After a few minutes drive the great metal sign \"London Zoo\" came into view and his youth returned. \n\nEven though he was old, the old Ranger did all he could to run and find his elephant. The paths of the Zoo winded and wove in and out of each different area, from the squawking birds to the howling monkeys and then eventually, finally, he heard it. The familiar sound of his friend the elephant. As he rushed over the old ranger heard it again and his speed increased. The enclosure was a stories drop into the ground, surrounded by a moat and covered in the same golden grasses which Kobus drove through on that fateful day. He leant over the side and saw an elephant, old in the eyes and big in the tusks. He smiled at Kobus, lifting his trunk and waving in an almost human way. Incredible. \nthe old ranger couldnt help himself, and he jumped into the enclosure, landing in the green water full of algae and elephant faecal matter. he didnt care. Kobus swam through the muck and came upon dry land, breathing heavily. When he got up, he saw that a crowd of people and staff had encircled the enclosure, some with worried looks on their faces, others with anger and walkie-talkies on theirs. \n\nKobus Du Plessis walked up to the grazing beast. Its eyes were familar and its smell was also. He ran his hand along its side and patted him affectionately. Unfortunately for Kobus, the elephant grabbed him with its large thick truck, picked him up and threw him across the enclosure to the gasps and awe of the crowd. The trumpeting was the last thing he heard before everything went black and dark. \n\nWhen Kobus awoke in the hospital three days later, he looked at his broken body and sighed to himself... \"I guess Elephants DO forget...\"  ",

Son, it\u2019s like this\u2026 who brings home the money in this family?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou, daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, so I am capitalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, what does your mother do?\u201d\n\n\u201cMom? She doesn\u2019t do anything...\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, so your mom is government.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, your mother is supposed to take care of you just like government is supposed to take care of its people, so you\u2019re the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the people!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. Now, the nanny is the working class, and your little brother, only two months old, is the future. I want you to think on this tonight, and I\u2019ll ask you tomorrow morning before school what you think politics is, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes daddy.\u201d\n\nEveryone goes to bed that night, only for the little boy to be woken up in the middle of the night by the cries of his baby brother who has pooped in his diaper. \u201cI should go get mom,\u201d the boy thinks, and he walks over to his parents\u2019 bedroom. His mother was still fast asleep, so instead of waking her, the boy headed to the nanny\u2019s room to get her to help with his brother.\n\nLooking through the keyhole of the room, he saw his father fucking the nanny.

Do you know how politics works now?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep, I have a pretty good idea now. It\u2019s actually really easy. Politics works like this: while capitalism screws the working class, the government is asleep and the people are in a tizzy over the fact that the future is in the shit.\u201d\n",

They order a cider, a Ginger Ale, and another scotch, that again the cat isn't paying for. The bartender declares it to be $13.50, and the man pulls that from his pocket without looking at it, and then drops $1.65 for tip. \n\nThis goes on for a few rounds, with the bartender naming the price, and the man not even counting his money.

You? You're set for life.\" The bartender pulled the man another pint, since obviously he could afford it. \"That's very smart; you're a smart man.\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, I thought so at first, but then I made my second wish.\"\n\n\"Really?

He quickly radios into headquarters. \"Boss, I just pulled over a huge celebrity! What should I do?\" His captain radios back, \"Well....who is it?\" \"Sir, I have no idea. But it has to be some one big....he's got the Pope driving for him!\"",

Wandering about, he notices a leopard heading rapidly in his direction with the intention of having lunch. \n\nThe old poodle thinks, 'Oh, oh! I'm in deep doo-doo now!' Noticing some bones on the ground close by, he immediately settles down to chew on the bones with his back to the approaching cat. Just as the leopard is about to leap the old poodle exclaims loudly, 'Boy, that was one delicious leopard!  I wonder if there are any more around here?' \n\nHearing this, the young leopard halts his attack in mid-strike, a look of terror comes over him and he slinks away into the trees. 'Whew!' says the leopard, 'That was close! That old poodle nearly had me!' \n\nMeanwhile, a monkey who had been watching the whole scene from a nearby tree, figures he can put this knowledge to good use and trade it for protection from the leopard. So off he goes, but the old poodle sees him heading after the leopard with great speed, and figures that something must be up. The monkey soon catches up with the leopard, spills the beans and strikes a deal for himself with the leopard. \n\nThe young leopard is furious at being made a fool of and says, 'Here, monkey, hop on my back and see what's going to happen to that conniving canine! \n\nNow, the old poodle sees the leopard coming with the monkey on his back and thinks, 'What am I going to do now?', but instead of running, the dog sits down with his back to his attackers, pretending he hasn't seen them yet, and just when they get close enough to hear, the old poodle says. \n\n'Where's that damn monkey?

The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is absolutely true?\"\n\n\"No,\" the man said, \"I actually just heard about it and...\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Socrates. \"So you don't really know if it's true or not. Now let's try the second filter, the filter of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about my friend something good?\"\n\n\"No, on the contrary...\"\n\n\"So,\" Socrates continued, \"you want to tell me something bad about him, but you're not certain it's true. You may still pass the test though, because there's one filter left: the filter of Usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about my friend going to be useful to me?\"\n\n\"No, not really.\"\n\n\"Well,\" concluded Socrates, \"if what you want to tell me is neither true nor good nor even useful, why tell it to me at all?\"\n\nThis is why Socrates was a great philosopher and held in such high esteem. **It also explains why he never found out that his best friend was having a secret affair with his wife.** [Source](http://smile.xonaki.com/Joke/EN?categoryCode=EN&jokeId=573)",

Since neither party speaks each other's language, they elect to have their debate using hand symbols. The Pope begins by holding up three fingers to which Moshe only raises his index finger. The Pope then makes a circular motion with one finger around his head. Moshe responds with an aggressive point to the floor. Finally the Pope takes out a bottle of wine and a communion wafer, Moshe removes an apple from his satchel and takes a bite. With this the the Pope throws his hands to the heavens and shouts \"the Jews have done it, they may stay in Rome. I can easily tell when I have been beaten.\"\n Later when the Pope convened with his disciples the only thing they wanted to was how the Pope lost, as they couldn't understand what was being \"said.\" \"You see,\" said the Pope \"it is all very simple. I held up three fingers to show that God takes on three forms: the father, the son, and the holy spirit. Moshe countered me with one finger to show that God only has one true form. Next, I made a circular motion to show that God was everywhere to which Moshe responded with his gesture towards the floor which meant God is here with us even right now. The third and final gesture of the wine and wafer was to show that Jesus died for our sins. Moshe used the apple to show me that Adam and Eve were the original sinners. It was all very simple.\"\nMeanwhile, over at the synagogue where Moshe took residence, all of Moshe's disciples were curious as to how he won the debate. \"Well you see,\" Moshe grunted \"the Pope held up three fingers to tell me the Jews had three days to leave Rome. I told him 'up yours.' He made a waving gesture with his hands telling me that every Jew needed to leave, regardless of where they go. I pointed at the floor to tell him we aren't going anywhere.\" Moshe resumed what he had been doing before the question arose. His disciples begged him to continue, asking him what the third and final thing meant. Moshe, without looking up from his desk coolly said \"And then we had lunch.\"\n\n\nThis is a joke that was told to me 10 years ago by my very Jewish father. I feel like it never gets old.\nEdit: updated punchline based on a suggestion from a commenter.",

Check this out\" - and he shows him a time zone display not just for every time zone in the world, but for the 86 largest metropoli. He hits a few buttons and from somewhere on the watch a voice says \"The time is eleven 'til six\" in a very West Texas accent. A few more buttons and the same voice says something in Japanese. Jake continues \"I've put in regional accents for each city\". The display is unbelievably high quality and the voice is simply astounding. \n\nThe stranger is struck dumb with admiration. \"That's not all,\" says Jake. He pushes a few more buttons and a tiny but very hi-resolution map of New York City appears on the display. \"The flashing dot shows our location by satellite positioning,\" explains Jake. \"View recede ten,\" Jake says, and the display changes to show eastern New York state. \n\n\"I want to buy this watch!\" says the stranger. \n\n\"Oh, no, it's not ready for sale yet; I'm still working out the bugs,\" says the inventor. \"But look at this,\" and he proceeds to demonstrate that the watch is also a very creditable little FM radio receiver with a digital tuner, a sonar device that can measure distances up to 125 meters, a pager with thermal paper printout and most impressive of all, the capacity for voice recordings of up to 300 standard-size books,\" though I only have 32 of my favorites in there so far\" says Jake. \n\n\"I've got to have this watch!\" says the stranger. \n\n\"No, you don't understand; it's not ready.\" \n\n\"I'll give you $1000 for it!\" \n\n\"Oh, no, I've already spent more than that.\" \n\n\"I'll give you $5000 for it!\" \n\n\"But it's just not fair.\" \n\n\"I'll give you $15,000 for it!\" And the stranger pulls out a checkbook. Jake stops to think. He's only put about $8500 into materials and development, and with $15 000 he can make another one and have it ready for merchandising in only six months. The stranger frantically finishes writing the check and waves it in front of him. \"Here it is, ready to hand to you right here and now. $15,000. Take it or leave it.\" Jake abruptly makes his decision. \"OK,\" he says and peels off the watch. They make the exchange and the stranger starts happily away. \n\n\"Hey, wait a minute,\" calls Jake after the stranger, who turns around warily.

He always wanted to accomplish something significant in his life, but he felt like he couldn't, because he was simply a normal Mini Wheat.\n\nOne day, the Mini Wheat was walking down the street when he saw a frosted Mini Wheat. \"Wow,\" the Mini Wheat thought, \"That guy looks really successful! I wanna be like him!\"\n\nSo the Mini Wheat approaches the frosted Mini Wheat and asks, \"How do I become a frosted mini wheat like you?\"\n\nThe frosted Mini Wheat replies, \"You have to go without eating for an entire day.\"\n\n\"I can do that,\" says the Mini Wheat. And he does: he practices his self restraint, and goes without food for a day, and BOOM, he becomes a frosted Mini Wheat.\n\nNow the Mini Wheat was more successful than he had ever been, but he wanted more. Out his window, he spotted a strawberry frosted Mini Wheat, and he rushed outside to meet him.\n\n\"Hello, sir!\" The mini wheat said, \"You must be really important. How do I get to be like you?\"\n\nThe strawberry frosted Mini Wheat replies, \"You have to go without eating for three days.\"\n\n\"I think I can do that,\" says the Mini Wheat.\n\nSo he puts aside all temptations, buckles down, and fasts for three days. And at the end of three days, BANG, he becomes a strawberry frosted Mini Wheat.\n\nNow the Mini Wheat is much happier. He has a well-paying job, a nice house, and he's even found a girlfriend with which to share his good fortune. But when he's walking down the street, wearing his expensive clothes and stylish shades, he comes across a blueberry frosted Mini Wheat.\n\n\"Wow,\" says the Mini Wheat, \"I want to be like that guy! Just LOOK at how RICH he is!\"\n\nSo the Mini Wheat approaches the blueberry frosted Mini Wheat and asks, \"How do I get to be as amazingly successful as you?\"\n\nThe blueberry frosted Mini Wheat tells him, \"You have to go without eating for a week.\"\n\n\"That'll be tough,\" the Mini Wheat thought, \"but I bet I could do it!\"\n\nSo he stuffs himself with food and then sits around his house without eating for a week. And at the end of a week, BAM, he becomes a blueberry frosted Mini Wheat.\n\nNow the Mini Wheat possessed more than he could have ever dreamed. He owned a small company, had a luxurious house, drove a fancy sports car, and was the biggest chick magnet at the bar.\n\nAnd yet he still wasn't satisfied, so when he saw a chocolate frosted Mini Wheat walking down the street, accompanied by his servants and bodyguards, he had to ask him, \"How could I become as popular and as famous as you?\"\n\nThe chocolate frosted Mini Wheat replied, \"You have to go without eating for a full month.\"\n\nThis was a challenge that the little Mini Wheat was not so sure he could complete. A month was, needless to say, a long time to go without food. But he figured he'd give it a try, because he really wanted to be as important as the chocolate frosted Mini Wheat before him.\n\nSo, one month later, the hungry and emaciated Mini Wheat finally turned into a chocolate frosted mini wheat.\n\nUpon his transformation, the Mini Wheat found himself in a world of unbelievable class. He attended all the fancy parties, he showed up in magazines and TV shows, and his company grew to financial greatness.\n\nBut there was one level of social status that the Mini Wheat still had yet to achieve, and an opportunity for this presented itself when he spotted a Big Wheat being thronged by people on the street.\n\nThe Mini Wheat rushed outside and elbowed his way through the crowd to get to the Big Wheat. Over the tumult, he yelled out, \"All my life I've been a Mini Wheat. How can I become a Big Wheat like you?\"\n\nThe Big Wheat heard him over the din and replied, \"You have to go without eating for an entire year.\"\n\nThe Mini Wheat's heart fell when he heard this. Surely he couldn't go a full YEAR without eating! He would die!\n\nBut this meant enough to the Mini Wheat that he was willing to try. So once again, he ate all the food he could, and settled down for a hibernation. Six months passed, then nine, then ten...the Mini Wheat was hungry, but he felt like he could make it.\n\nFinally, FINALLY, after one painfully long year, the Mini Wheat awoke from his slumber to find that he was no longer a Mini Wheat: he was now, a Big Wheat.\n\nSoon, the ex-Mini Wheat became the mayor of the city, a huge figure in popular culture, and his business grew to a global scale. He bought office buildings around the world, and even had a skyscraper to call his home.\n\nHe had one of his frosted Mini Wheat butlers show him around his new skyscraper, explaining all the services and luxuries at his disposal.\n\n\"Here, you'll find the movie theater, and on your left is the pool,\" the butler said. \"Beyond that is the bowling alley, the spa, and the cafeteria, down at the end.\"\n\nThey stepped out into the cafeteria, where different counters all sold different drinks. \"Any of those drinks you want, you can have,\" the butler told the Big Wheat. \"You won't have to pay for them, but you will have to wait in line.\"\n\n\"Wow,\" the Big Wheat said, \"I can have ANY of these drinks? Whenever I want?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the butler chuckled. He gestured around the room. \"As you can see, there's a line for soda, a line for coffee, a line for beer, a line for milk...\"\n\n\"What about Punch?\" The Big Wheat asked. \"I like punch. It reminds me of all the fruity flavors I've gone through to reach where I am today.\"\n\nThe butler glanced around the room for a moment, and then shook his head. \"Im sorry, sir,\" he said, \"There's no punch line.\"\n",

        "body": "Alright, so yesterday I was driving home from work down the higway when I came upon a huge traffic jam. It was a 3 way highway and the weird thing was the left lane seemed open but the two right lanes were absolutely clogged. I figured there must be some roadwork ahead or something. Anyways after 10 minutes of going the painful speed of a turtle that's slowdancing I still saw no pylon or any mention that the left lane was actually closed off... I decided fuck it, I'll give it a try see how far I come. As I slowly started speeding up, it seemed totally free suprisingly. Quited stunned by the fact no-one was using this lane I just kept on driving for about a mile or 2 when I got at the origin of the trafic jam. There was a funural procession with about 10 funeral cars in front and a man with his dog leading the way.\n\nNot wanting to look like a complete asshole I slowed down and gave my condolences to the man.\nQuite puzzled by the huge line of people following the funeral procession I couldn't contain my curiousity, I had to ask him. Who was the deceased? A famous person or something?\n\"Oh no, it's just my mother in law\" he responded.\nAh.. I'm sorry to hear that, my condolences again with your loss.\n\"No worries, I always hated the old hag\"\nBeing the (morbidly) curious basterd I am, I had to ask; What had happened with his MIL?\n\n\"Well you see, that's quite the story.\"\n\n\"To make sense of it, you have to know my dog has always been very sensitive about how I feel about people. And is quite overly protective.\"\n\nI nodded and he continued.\n\n\"The old hag always used to comment on our house not being clean enough, that her daughter could have done way better than me, that my carreer was going nowhere, yada yada, she could keep it up for hours\"\n\n\"So anyways, here was thanksgiving and somehow my wife still insists she eats with us, because her mother has no one else left. No wonder right? hah.\"\n\nI grinned, as he was pretty much describing my own MIL. He continued the story\n\n\"So, here we are on thanksgiving a few hours in, I drank quite heavily just to sustain my sanity during the continues snide remarks and bitching overall. And then she made that one remark.\"\n\nShe said: \"Have you thought about getting your son checked out yet? He hardly speaks any words yet and he's almost 2! He also looks a little retarded, it wouldn't suprise me to be honest\"\n\n\"That one sent me over the edge man, I was ready to explode and oh boy did my dog sense it. Before I could react or anything he just jumped to her throath and bit it right open, nothing could be done. And alas, here we are.\"\n\n\nJezus, I said, that's quite the story indeed. Guess your dog is a really good boy, I joked.\n\n\"Haha, yea, I guess you can look at it from that way.\"\n\n\"hey uh....\" I said pauzing a while overthinking it..\n\n\"Is there any chance....?\"\n\n\"I could borrow your dog for a few days perhaps?\"\n\n\"Yeah mate, sure thing.\" The man responded, \"Just get behind in line.\"\n",

If necessary, there's a small closet with more blankets and sheets across the cabin.\n\nA little under an hour after they settle in, after much tossing and turning, the woman in the top bunk says, \"It's so cold in here.\"\n\nThe man grumbles, turning over and over himself, looking for warmth.\n\nA few more minutes pass.\n\nThe woman asks the man, \"I don't suppose you could get me a blanket from the closet, please?\"\n\nThe man grumbles again, rolling in bed.\n\n\"Please?\" the woman pleads.\n\nThe man sighs, relents.  \"You know what...I've been thinking...

While walking to the sandwich shop he passes by a pet store and in the window he sees a bull frog for $10,000. He thinks, \"I got to see why this bull frog is $10,000!\" He walks up to the store clerk and ask, \"Hey why is that bull frog $10,000?\" The store clerk responds, \"Well that there is a special frog. It gives the best blow jobs in the world. If you don't believe me take it home for the night and try it.\" So the guy figures what the hell the wife is gone anyway. A week passes and the wife gets home. When she walks into the kitchen she is shocked to see food all over the floor, her husband sitting at the table, and in the middle of the kitchen a frog sitting on a open cook book. She looks to her husband, \"Honey what is going on?\" He looks back at her, \"Shut up bitch as soon as this frog learns to cook your outa here!\" ",

They both stomp on the brakes and pray that they can stop this plan before the landing strip ends.  After a brief instant that seemed to last an eternity the plan finally lurches forward and back and the pilots sit in disbelief that they've managed to pull off such a difficult landing.  The pilot says \"phew that has to be the shortest runway I've ever seen.\"  The co-pilot agrees, but looking out both sides of the cockpit he remarks \"But wow it's definitely the widest, by far.\"",

        "body": "\nThere once was a boy named little Johnny. Little Johnny loved trains. All he ever wanted to do was play with trains when he was younger and from the age of 8 all he wanted to do when he grew up was become a train conductor. So Little Johnny studied all through grade school and high school and eventually got into the best train conductor university in all the land. Little Johnny graduated that university with flying colors and took a job with the most presitigious train company out there. Now that he was all grown up little johnny was called John, and John loved his job. He loved saying \u201call aboard\u201d, he loved talking to the passengers asking what stop there were getting off at and hearing why, and he loved driving the train, his train. \nBut one day Johnny snapped, he realized that his whole life he was just driving this train back and forth on the same railroad track, the same destinations, with the same people. He was so disappointed with the monotony that he blew right through a break light at a station and SMASHED into a school bus full of kids. Backpacks flying, pencils, paper everywhere, 19 kids are injured and 3 kids killed. Now the local government couldn\u2019t stand for this; and John was convicted to the electric chair. It is common knowledge that before you go to the electric chair you are allowed one meal, and you have to be given it. \nSo john, being the smartass he is asks for a Red Banana from the deepest darkest corner of West Africa. So the hail sends 3 men to west Africa and after a week of searching finally procure this red banana, but on the way back one gets Ebola, the other malaria, luckily the 3rd is unscathed. Now the warden is really pissed so he throws john the red banana, who eats it ferociously, and they douse him with water, attach the head gear, strap him into the electric chair and with a smile the warden flips the switch.\nNothing happens. The warden angrily tries it again, nothing.One more time he flips the switch. Again nothing.  \nSo because of a loophole in the law books if the electric chair does not work then you have to let the guy go. They let John go and the warden, mystified, asks him what was in the red banana that made the electric chair not work?\u201d to which John replies \u201cnothing, I\u2019m just a bad conductor\u201d \n",

The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air.\n\nEvery morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor, she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. However the years went by and he continued to rip them out. \n\nThen one Christmas day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the bed covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. \n\nSometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bath room. \n\nThe wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. \n\nHe said, \u201cHoney you were right\u2026 all these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked his wife. \n\n\u201cWell, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened! But by the grace of god, some Vaseline and two fingers. I think I got most of them back in...\"",

At the orphanage, he met a boy named Bob.  They became great friends, and they went everywhere together.  Soon the boy's life seemed to be looking up.  Then, one day, Bob was shot when trying to help an old woman who was being mugged.  The boy, now more than ever, felt truly alone.\n\nThe next week, the orphanage was going on their yearly field trip.  This time they went sailing on huge sailboats.  The boy got to man the bird's nest to look out for storms.  He was having the time of his life when suddenly the boat heeled over on a particularly strong gust of wind and the boy was thrown from the bird's nest.  He landed with a splat on the deck, fifty feet below.  Everyone gasped, but to their surprise, the boy stood up and dusted himself off.  He was perfectly fine.\n\n\"How did you survive that fall?  You were fifty feet up!\" someone exclaimed.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the boy. \"I guess I'm just used to hardships.\"",

Along with all the trucks and large vehicles, there were two large figures dressed in full Lunar spacesuits.\n\nNearby a Navajo sheep herder and his son were watching the strange creatures walk about, occasionally being tended by personnel.  The two Navajo people were noticed and approached by the NASA personnel.  Since the man did not know English, his son asked for him what the strange creatures were and the NASA people told them that they are just men that are getting ready to go to the moon.  \n\nThe man became very excited and asked if he could send a message to the moon with the astronauts. The NASA personnel thought this was a great idea so they rustled up a tape recorder.  After the man gave them his message, they asked his son to translate.  His son would not.\n\nLater, they tried a few more people on the reservation to translate and every person they asked would chuckle and then refuse to translate. \n\nFinally, with cash in hand, someone translated the message, \"Watch out for these guys, they come to take your land.\"",

This is an actual account as relayed to paramedics at a chili cook-off in Texas.\n\nNote: Please take time to read this slowly. If you pay attention to the first two judges, the reaction of the third judge is even better. For those of you who have lived in Texas, you know how true this is.  They actually have a Chili Cook-off about the time Halloween comes around. It takes up a major portion of a parking lot at the San Antonio City Park.\n\nJudge #3 was an inexperienced Chili taster named Frank, who was visiting from Springfield, IL.\n\nFrank: \"Recently, I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table, asking for directions to the Coors Light truck, when the call came in. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy; and, besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted and became Judge 3.\" \n\nHere are the scorecard notes from the event:\n\nCHILI # 1 - MIKE'S MANIAC MONSTER CHILI\n\nJudge # 1 -- A little too heavy on the tomato. Amusing kick.\nJudge # 2 -- Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild. \nJudge # 3 (Frank) -- Holy crap, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy.\n\nCHILI # 2 - AUSTIN 'S AFTERBURNER CHILI \n\nJudge # 1 -- Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang.\nJudge # 2 -- Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.\nJudge # 3 -- Keep this out of the reach of children.  I'm not sure what I'm supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face. \n\nCHILI # 3 - FRED'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI\n\nJudge # 1 -- Excellent firehouse chili. Great kick.\nJudge # 2 -- A bit salty, good use of peppers.\nJudge # 3 -- Call the EPA. I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone know s the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all of the beer. \n\nCHILI # 4 - BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC\n\nJudge # 1 -- Black bean chili with almost no spice.  Disappointing.\nJudge # 2 -- Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili. \nJudge # 3 -- I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out taste buds? Sally, the beer maid, was standing behind me with fresh refills. This 300 lb. woman is starting to look HOT .. just like this nuclear waste I'm eating! Is chili an aphrodisiac? \n\nCHILI # 5 -  LISA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER\n\nJudge # 1 -- Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.\nJudge # 2 -- Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement. \nJudge # 3 -- My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted, and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from the pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off. It really ticks me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw them. \n \nCHILI # 6 - VERA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY\n\nJudge # 1 -- Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili.  Good balance of spices and peppers.\nJudge # 2 -- The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, garlic. Superb. \nJudge # 3 -- My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I crapped on myself when I farted, and I'm worried it  will eat through the chair.   No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that Sally. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my butt with a snow cone. \n\nCHILI # 7 - SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI\n\nJudge # 1 -- A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.\nJudge # 2 -- Ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment.  **I should take note that I am worried about Judge #3. He appears to be a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably. \nJudge # 3 -- You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava to match my shirt. At least during the autopsy, they'll know what killed me.  I've decided to stop breathing it's too painful. Screw it; I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach. \n\nCHILI # 8 - BIG TOM'S TOENAIL CURLING CHILI\n\nJudge # 1 -- The perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili. Not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.\nJudge # 2 -- This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge #3 farted, passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of  himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor feller, wonder how he'd have reacted to really hot chili?  \nJudge # 3 - No Report",

If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man.\"\n\"Ok,\" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house.\nBefore dinner, the daughter came down the stairs.

He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn he crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy.\nHe woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, \"Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest.\"\n\"Well, that's pretty crappy,\" he thought. \"If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about.\" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: \"Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle.\"\nIn a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder.\nAs he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, \"Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost.\"",

A friend of mine has a 5 yr old son that suffers from this and we are raising funds to pay for a year's therapy. \n\nMute Tourette's syndrome has long been in the shadow of its more 'famous' sister-disease, 'Tourette's Syndrome', and although much rarer, is even more tragic in its consequences. \n\nWhile a child suffering from Tourette's has difficulty in containing its anger and frustration, a child with Mute Tourette's suffers a worse fate, and is unable to express their true feelings. \n\nThe Mute Tourette's Foundation is using radical new art therapy techniques to help combat the frustration and loneliness of Mute Tourette's. However, their work can only continue with your help. \n\nJust $0.25 will keep a child supplied with crayons and paper for a whole day. $1.50 will provide them with enough art supplies for a week. I would therefore be extremely grateful if you were able to help with such a deserving cause. \n\nPlease find attached a picture which clearly demonstrates just how the donations received so far have been put to such good use.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/o70OpuF\n\n\n",

Things that used to fill me with joy now leave me with an aching absence in my chest, a yawning cavity that holds nothing and says nothing, just an incredible sense of the insignificance of life in general and me as an example of it.\n\nI look at my wife across the table every day at dinner and no longer recognize the woman I fell in love with. She has become vapid, shallow, the sort of superficial bimbo that I always despised when I was growing up. Maybe it simply proves that I was never as significant as I imagined, that I am on the same level as those I formerly looked down on. That my sense of being special and unique is just a biological ruse, something that forces me to cling to life.\n\nAnd the most shattering is that I look at my son and realize that I despise him as well. He holds this mirror up to me, shows me as the mediocre shell I am, spinning my wheels and waiting for the release that only oblivion can bring.\"\n\nThe doctor looked deep into the moth's tortured eyes and was clenched by a mixed feeling of pity and revulsion, knowing that there were aspects of the moth's soliloquy that touched the very core of his own being. He cleared his throat.\n\n\"Well, I'd love to prescribe you some antidepressants, but they're designed to work on humans.

The doctor looks at the class in sympathy and reluctantly reveals the other principles. \n\n\"The second principle is you must respect the cadaver. You all failed to do this by unceremoniously inserting your fingers up its anus. The third principle is you must have keen observation to form a successful autopsy. You all failed to note that while I shoved my middle finger up the cadaver's anus, I licked my forefinger.\"\n",

They were a happy couple, enjoying each other's company when suddenly a bright light flooded their bedroom. The winds picked up and howled, rattling the windows. A low, resonant hum echoed in their bones. \n\n\"M-Mitch,\" the wife stammered, pulling the covers around her. \"Why don't you go on and see what all the commotion is?\"\n\n\"Alright, Elle-May,\" he replied, rising and slipping into his boxers. \"You just sit tight.\"\n\nAs her husband left the room, the wife bundled the bed sheets around her more tightly and followed despite her husband's warning. As they came to stand in the field, they spied a large, alien vessel hovering mere feet above the earth. Two humanoid shapes were standing in front of it. \nThey were mostly human, though their skin shone oddly in the pale flood lights and their eyes were dark as pitch. One stepped forward, it's arms raised in a gentle, peaceful demonstration. \"We come in peace,\" it said, it's voice deep and it's English near perfect. \"We have been studying your planet for some time and have come down with a singular proposition for you. My mate and I were interested to know if you would enjoy trading partners for the activity you know as sex.\"\n\nStartled, but seeing they meant them no physical harm, the humans agrees to the trade. The silent alien stepped forward and took Elle-May by the hands and gently turned her around. The wife looked back to her husband as the alien approached him, and sighed feebly as they joined hands and walked back inside the house. She soon felt a strong hand on her shoulder, and wih a weak smile, she was guided into the spacecraft. \n\nThe male alien undressed and the human stifled a laugh. She gasped at her rude behavior, the confusion apparent on the males face. \"I'm sorry, sir. It's just... Your 'equipment is just so...\"\n\n\"Ah, I see the problem. This is merely for convenience. You see, our race endeavors in a great many conquests and are equipped differently. Here,\" he signaled her to wait and then tugged at his earlobe. With one tug, his penis was suddenly as long as a pencil, but just as thin. Seeing the woman was not yet impressed, he tugged once more. This time, it was about the size of her husband's. Feeling a little greedy, she shrugged and the alien tugged once more. His penis grew yet again and the woman was beside herself with lust. Seeing he was spot on, now, they enjoyed their time together with gentle, passionate lovemaking. \n\nAfter they were through, the mixed couples met back on the lawn. The aliens thanked them for their time and were soon up, up and away, disappearing into the night sky. \n\n\"Well, that's was certainly an... Experience.\" Elle-May stated, still a bit winded with a blush on her cheeks. \"How about for you, sweetie?\"\n\nThe husband smiled, but brushed a hand through his salt-and-pepper hair. \"It was... Nice.\" He shrugged, still looking a bit bewildered. \"Once the sex started, she was... Well, out of this world. But before that, she kept tugging on my ears...\"",

Do you think I could stay the night?\"\n\nThe monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, and even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound; a sound like no other that he has ever heard. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \"We can't tell you because you're not a monk.\"\n\nThe man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.   \n \nThe monks again accept him, feed him, and fix his car.\n\nThat night, he hears the same strange mesmerizing sound that he had heard years earlier.\n\nThe next morning, he asks what the sound was, but the monks reply,\n\"We can't tell you, because you're not a monk.\"\n\nThe man says, \"All right, all right. I'm dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?\"\n\nThe monks reply, \"You must travel the Earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you know this, you will become a monk.\"\n\nThe man sets about his task. Some forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, \"I have traveled the Earth and devoted my life to the task demanded and have found what you had asked for. There are 371,145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 grains of sand on the earth.\n\nThe monks reply, \"Congratulations, you are correct, and you are now considered a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.\"\n\nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \"The sound is behind that door.\"\n\nThe man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He asks, \"May I have the key?\"\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man requests the key to the stone door.\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.  And so it went on until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.\n\nFinally, the monks say, \"This is the key to the last door.\"\n\nThe man is relieved to be at the end. He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is astonished to find the source of that strange sound. It is truly an amazing and unbelievable sight...\n\n...But I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.\n",

        "body": "Knock knock.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"John Galt.\"\n\n\"John Galt who?\"\n\n...\n\nFor twelve years, you have been asking: Who is John Galt? This is John Galt speaking. I am the man who loves his life. I am the man who does not sacrifice his love or his values. I am the man who has deprived you of victims and thus has destroyed your world, and if you wish to know why you are perishing-you who dread knowledge-I am the man who will now tell you.\u201d \nThe chief engineer was the only one able to move; he ran to a television set and struggled frantically with its dials. But the screen remained empty; the speaker had not chosen to be seen. Only his voice filled the airways of the country-of the world, thought the chief engineer-sounding as if he were speaking here, in this room, not to a group, but to one man; it was not the tone of addressing a meeting, but the tone of addressing a mind.\n\u201cYou have heard it said that this is an age of moral crisis. You have said it yourself, half in fear, half in hope that the words had no meaning. You have cried that man\u2019s sins are destroying the world and you have cursed human nature for its unwillingness to practice the virtues you demanded. Since virtue, to you, consists of sacrifice, you have demanded more sacrifices at every successive disaster. In the name of a return to morality, you have sacrificed all those evils which you held as the cause of your plight. You have sacrificed justice to mercy. You have sacrificed independence to unity. You have sacrificed reason to faith. You have sacrificed wealth to need. You have sacrificed self-esteem to self-denial. You have sacrificed happiness to duty.\n\u201cYou have destroyed all that which you held to be evil and achieved all that which you held to be good. Why, then, do you shrink in horror from the sight of the world around you? That world is not the product of your sins, it is the product and the image of your virtues. It is your moral ideal brought into reality in its full and final perfection. You have fought for it, you have dreamed of it, and you have wished it, and I-I am the man who has granted you your wish.\n\u201cYour ideal had an implacable enemy, which your code of morality was designed to destroy. I have withdrawn that enemy. I have taken it out of your way and out of your reach. I have removed the source of all those evils you were sacrificing one by one. I have ended your battle. I have stopped your motor. I have deprived your world of man\u2019s mind.\n\u201cMen do not live by the mind, you say? I have withdrawn those who do. The mind is impotent, you say? I have withdrawn those whose mind isn\u2019t. There are values higher than the mind, you say? I have withdrawn those for whom there aren\u2019t.\n\u201cWhile you were dragging to your sacrificial altars the men of justice, of independence, of reason, of wealth, of self-esteem-I beat you to it, I reached them first. I told them the nature of the game you were playing and the nature of that moral code of yours, which they had been too innocently generous to grasp. I showed them the way to live by another morality-mine. It is mine that they chose to follow.\n\u201cAll the men who have vanished, the men you hated, yet dreaded to lose, it is I who have taken them away from you. Do not attempt to find us. We do not choose to be found. Do not cry that it is our duty to serve you. We do not recognize such duty. Do not cry that you need us. We do not consider need a claim. Do not cry that you own us. You don\u2019t. Do not beg us to return. We are on strike, we, the men of the mind.\n\u201cWe are on strike against self-immolation. We are on strike against the creed of unearned rewards and unrewarded duties. We are on strike against the dogma that the pursuit of one\u2019s happiness is evil. We are on strike against the doctrine that life is guilt.\n\u201cThere is a difference between our strike and all those you\u2019ve practiced for centuries: our strike consists, not of making demands, but of granting them. We are evil, according to your morality. We have chosen not to harm you any longer. We are useless, according to your economics. We have chosen not to exploit you any longer. We are dangerous and to be shackled, according to your politics. We have chosen not to endanger you, nor to wear the shackles any longer. We are only an illusion, according to your philosophy. We have chosen not to blind you any longer and have left you free to face reality-the reality you wanted, the world as you see it now, a world without mind.\n\u201cWe have granted you everything you demanded of us, we who had always been the givers, but have only now understood it. We have no demands to present to you, no terms to bargain about, no compromise to reach. You have nothing to offer us. We do not need you.\n\u201cAre you now crying: No, this was not what you wanted? A mindless world of ruins was not your goal? You did not want us to leave you? You moral cannibals, I know that you\u2019ve always known what it was that you wanted. But your game is up, because now we know it, too.\n\u201cThrough centuries of scourges and disasters, brought about by your code of morality, you have cried that your code had been broken, that the scourges were punishment for breaking it, that men were too weak and too selfish to spill all the blood it required. You damned man, you damned existence, you damned this earth, but never dared to question your code. Your victims took the blame and struggled on, with your curses as reward for their martyrdom-while you went on crying that your code was noble, but human nature was not good enough to practice it. And no one rose to ask the question: Good?-by what standard?\n\u201cYou wanted to know John Galt\u2019s identity. I am the man who has asked that question.\n\u201cYes, this is an age of moral crisis. Yes, you are bearing punishment for your evil. But it is not man who is now on trial and it is not human nature that will take the blame. It is your moral code that\u2019s through, this time. Your moral code has reached its climax, the blind alley at the end of its course. And if you wish to go on living, what you now need is not to return to morality-you who have never known any-but to discover it.\n\u201cYou have heard no concepts of morality but the mystical or the social. You have been taught that morality is a code of behavior imposed on you by whim, the whim of a supernatural power or the whim of society, to serve God\u2019s purpose or your neighbor\u2019s welfare, to please an authority beyond the grave or else next door-but not to serve your life or pleasure. Your pleasure, you have been taught, is to be found in immorality, your interests would best be served by evil, and any moral code must be designed not for you, but against you, not to further your life, but to drain it.\n\u201cFor centuries, the battle of morality was fought between those who claimed that your life belongs to God and those who claimed that it belongs to your neighbors-between those who preached that the good is self-sacrifice for the sake of ghosts in heaven and those who preached that the good is self-sacrifice for the sake of incompetents on earth. And no one came to say that your life belongs to you and that the good is to live it.\n\u201cBoth sides agreed that morality demands the surrender of your self-interest and of your mind, that the moral and the practical are opposites, that morality is not the province of reason, but the province of faith and force. Both sides agreed that no rational morality is possible, that there is no right or wrong in reason-that in reason there\u2019s no reason to be moral.\n\u201cWhatever else they fought about, it was against man\u2019s mind that all your moralists have stood united. It was man\u2019s mind that all their schemes and systems were intended to despoil and destroy. Now choose to perish or to learn that the anti-mind is the anti-life.\n\u201cMan\u2019s mind is his basic tool of survival. Life is given to him, survival is not. His body is given to him, its sustenance is not. His mind is given to him, its content is not. To remain alive, he must act, and before he can act he must know the nature and purpose of his action. He cannot obtain his food without a knowledge of food and of the way to obtain it. He cannot dig a ditch-or build a cyclotron-without a knowledge of his aim and of the means to achieve it. To remain alive, he must think.\n\u201cBut to think is an act of choice. The key to what you so recklessly call \u2018human nature,\u2019 the open secret you live with, yet dread to name, is the fact that man is a being of volitional consciousness. Reason does not work automatically; thinking is not a mechanical process; the connections of logic are not made by instinct. The function of your stomach, lungs or heart is automatic; the function of your mind is not. In any hour and issue of your life, you are free to think or to evade that effort. But you are not free to escape from your nature, from the fact that reason is your means of survival-so that for you, who are a human being, the question \u2018to be or not to be\u2019 is the question \u2018to\u2019 think or not to think.\u2019\n\u201cA being of volitional consciousness has no automatic course of behavior. He needs a code of values to guide his actions. \u2018Value\u2019 is that which one acts to gain and keep, \u2018virtue\u2019 is the action by which one gains and keeps it. \u2018Value\u2019 presupposes an answer to the question: of value to whom and for what? \u2018Value\u2019 presupposes a standard, a purpose and the necessity of action in the face of an alternative. Where there are no alternatives, no values are possible.\n\u201cThere is only one fundamental alternative in the universe: existence or non-existence-and it pertains to a single class of entities: to living organisms. The existence of inanimate matter is unconditional, the existence of life is not; it depends on a specific course of action. Matter is indestructible, it changes its forms, but it cannot cease to exist. It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative: the issue of life or death. Life is a process of self-sustaining and-self-generated action. If an organism fails in that action, it does; its chemical elements remain, but its life goes out of existence. It is only the concept of \u2018Life\u2019 that makes the concept of \u2018Value\u2019 possible. It is only to a living entity that things can be good or evil.\n\u201cA plant must feed itself in order to live; the sunlight, the water, the chemicals it needs are the values its nature has set it to pursue; its life is the standard of value directing its actions. But a plant has no choice of action; there are alternatives in the conditions it encounters, but there is no alternative in its function: it acts automatically to further its life, it cannot act for its own destruction.\n\u201cAn animal is equipped for sustaining its life; its senses provide it with an automatic code of action, an automatic knowledge of what is good for it or evil. It has no power to extend its knowledge or to evade it. In conditions where its knowledge proves inadequate, it dies. But so long as it lives, it acts on its knowledge, with automatic safety and no power of choice, it is unable to ignore its own good, unable to decide to choose the evil and act as its own destroyer.\n\u201cMan has no automatic code of survival. His particular distinction from all other living species is the necessity to act in the face of alternatives by means of volitional choice. He has no automatic knowledge of what is good for him or evil, what values his life depends on, what course of action it requires. Are you prattling about an instinct of self-preservation? An instinct of self-preservation is precisely what man does not possess. An \u2018instinct\u2019 is an unerring and automatic form of knowledge. A desire is not an instinct. A desire to live does not give you the knowledge required for living. And even man\u2019s desire to live is not automatic: your secret evil today is that that is the desire you do not hold. Your fear of death is not a love of life and will not give you the knowledge needed to keep it. Man must obtain his knowledge and choose his actions by a process of thinking, which nature will not force him t9 perform. Man has the power to act as his own destroyer-and that is the way he has acted through most of his history.\n\u201cA living entity that regarded its means of survival as evil, would not survive. A plant that struggled to mangle its roots, a bird that fought to break its wings would not remain for long in the existence they affronted. But the history of man has been a struggle to deny and to destroy his mind.\n\u201cMan has been called a rational being, but rationality is a matter of choice-and the alternative his nature offers him is: rational being or suicidal animal. Man has to be man-by choice; he has to hold his life as a value-by choice: he has to learn to sustain it-by choice; he has to discover the values it requires and practice his virtues-by choice.\n\u201cA code of values accepted by choice is a code of morality.\n\u201cWhoever you are, you who are hearing me now, I am speaking to whatever living remnant is left uncorrupted within you, to the remnant of the human, to your mind, and I say: There is a morality of reason, a morality proper to man, and Man\u2019s Life is its standard of value.\n\u201cAll that which is proper to the life of a rational being is the good; all that which destroys it is the evil.\n\u201cMan\u2019s life, as required by his nature, is not the life of a mindless brute, of a looting thug or a mooching mystic, but the life of a thinking being-not life by means of force or fraud, but life by means of achievement-not survival at any price, since there\u2019s only one price that pays for man\u2019s survival: reason.\n\u201cMan\u2019s life is the standard of morality, but your own life is its purpose. If existence on earth is your goal, you must choose your actions and values by the standard of that which is proper to man-for the purpose of preserving, fulfilling and enjoying the irreplaceable value which is your life.\n\u201cSince life requires a specific course of action, any other course will destroy it. A being who does not hold his own life as the motive and goal of his actions, is acting on the motive and standard of death. Such a being is a metaphysical monstrosity, struggling to oppose, negate and contradict the fact of his own existence, running blindly amuck on a trail of destruction, capable of nothing but pain.\n\u201cHappiness is the successful state of life, pain is an agent of death. Happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of one\u2019s values. A morality that dares to tell you to find happiness in the renunciation of your happiness-to value the failure of your values-is an insolent negation of morality. A doctrine that gives you, as an ideal, the role of a sacrificial animal seeking slaughter on the altars of others, is giving you death as your standard. By the grace of reality and the nature of life, man-every man-is an end in himself, he exists for his own sake, and the achievement of his own happiness is his highest moral purpose.\n\u201cBut neither life nor happiness can be achieved by the pursuit of irrational whims. Just as man is free to attempt to survive in any random manner, but will perish unless he lives as his nature requires, so he is free to seek his happiness in any mindless fraud, but the torture of frustration is all he will find, unless he seeks the happiness proper to man. The purpose of morality is to teach you, not to suffer and die, but to enjoy yourself and live.\n\u201cSweep aside those parasites of subsidized classrooms, who live on the profits of the mind of others and proclaim that man needs no morality, no values, no code of behavior. They, who pose as scientists and claim that man is only an animal, do not grant him inclusion in the law of existence they have granted to the lowest of insects. They recognize that every living species has a way of survival demanded by its nature, they do not claim that a fish can live out of water or that a dog can live without its sense of smell-but man, they claim, the most complex of beings, man can survive in any way whatever, man has no identity, no nature, and there\u2019s no practical reason why he cannot live with his means of survival destroyed, with his mind throttled and placed at the disposal of any orders they might care to issue.\n\u201cSweep aside those hatred-eaten mystics, who pose as friends of humanity and preach that the highest virtue man can practice is to hold his own life as of no value. Do they tell you that the purpose of morality is to curb man\u2019s instinct of self-preservation? It is for the purpose of self-preservation that man needs a code of morality. The only man who desires to be moral is the man who desires to live.\n\u201cNo, you do not have to live; it is your basic act of choice; but if you choose to live,. you must live as a man-by the work and the judgment of your mind.\n\u201cNo, you do not have to live as a man; it is an act of moral choice. But you cannot live as anything else-and the alternative is that state of living death which you now see within you and around you, the state of a thing unfit for existence, no longer human and less than animal, a thing that knows nothing but pain and drags itself through its span of years in the agony of unthinking self-destruction.\n\u201cNo, you do not have to think; it is an act of moral choice. But someone had to think to keep you alive; if you choose to default, you default on existence and you pass the deficit to some moral man, expecting him to sacrifice his good for the sake of letting you survive by your evil.\n\u201cNo, you do not have to be a man; but today those who are, are not there any longer. I have removed your means of survival-your victims.\n\u201cIf you wish to know how I have done it and what I told them to make them quit, you are hearing it now. I told them, in essence, the statement I am making tonight. They were men who had lived by my code, but had not known how great a virtue it represented. I made them see it. I brought them, not a re-evaluation, but only an identification of their values.\n\u201cWe, the men of the mind, are now on strike against you in the name of a single axiom, which is the root of our moral code, just as the root of yours is the wish to escape it: the axiom that existence exists.\n\u201cExistence exists-and the act of grasping that statement implies two corollary axioms: that something exists which one perceives and that one exists possessing consciousness, consciousness being the faculty of perceiving that which exists.\n\u201cIf nothing exists, there can be no consciousness: a consciousness with nothing to be conscious of is a contradiction in terms. A consciousness conscious of nothing but itself is a contradiction in terms: before it could identify itself as consciousness, it had to be conscious of something. If that which you claim to perceive does not exist, what you possess is not consciousness.\n\u201cWhatever the degree of your knowledge, these two-existence and consciousness-are axioms you cannot escape, these two are the irreducible primaries implied in any action you undertake, in any part of your knowledge and in its sum, from the first ray of light you perceive at the start of your life to the widest erudition you might acquire at its end. Whether you know the shape of a pebble or the structure of a solar system, the axioms remain the same: that it exists and that you know it.\n\u201cTo exist is to be something, as distinguished from the nothing of non-existence, it is to be an entity of a specific nature made of specific attributes. Centuries ago, the man who was-no matter what his errors-the greatest of your philosophers, has stated the formula defining the concept of existence and the rule of all knowledge: A is A. A thing is itself. You have never grasped the meaning of his statement. I am here to complete it: Existence is Identity, Consciousness is Identification.\n\u201cWhatever you choose to consider, be it an object, an attribute or an action, the law of identity remains the same. A leaf cannot be a stone at the same time, it cannot be all red and all green at the same time, it cannot freeze and burn at the same time. A is A. Or, if you wish it stated in simpler language: You cannot have your cake and eat it, too.\n\u201cAre you seeking to know what is wrong with the world? All the disasters that have wrecked your world, came from your leaders\u2019 attempt to evade the fact that A is A. All the secret evil you dread to face within you and all the pain you have ever endured, came from your own attempt to evade the fact that A is A. The purpose of those who taught you to evade it, was to make you forget that Man is Man.\n\u201cMan cannot survive except by gaining knowledge, and reason is his only means to gain it. Reason is the faculty that perceives, identifies and integrates the material provided by his senses. The task of his senses is to give him the evidence of existence, but the task of identifying it belongs to his reason, his senses tell him only that something is, but what it is must be learned by his mind.\n\u201cAll thinking is a process of identification and integration. Man perceives a blob of color; by integrating the evidence of his sight and his touch, he learns to identify it as a solid object; he learns to identify the object as a table; he learns that the table is made of wood; he learns that the wood consists of cells, that the cells consist of molecules, that the molecules consist of atoms. All through this process, the work of his mind consists of answers to a single question: What is it? His means to establish the truth of his answers is logic, and logic rests on the axiom that existence exists. Logic is the art of non-contradictory identification. A contradiction cannot exist. An atom is itself, and so is the universe; neither can contradict its own identity; nor can a part contradict the whole. No concept man forms is valid unless he integrates it without contradiction into the total sum of his knowledge. To arrive at a contradiction is to confess an error in one\u2019s thinking; to maintain a contradiction is to abdicate one\u2019s mind and to evict oneself from the realm of reality.\n\u201cReality is that which exists; the unreal does not exist; the unreal is merely that negation of existence which is the content of a human consciousness when it attempts to abandon reason. Truth is the recognition of reality; reason, man\u2019s only means of knowledge, is his only standard of truth.\n\u201cThe most depraved sentence you can now utter is to ask: Whose reason? The answer is: Yours. No matter how vast your knowledge or how modest, it is your own mind that has to acquire it. It is only with your own knowledge that you can deal. It is only your own knowledge that you can claim to possess or ask others to consider. Your mind is your only judge of truth-and if others dissent from your verdict, reality is the court of final appeal. Nothing but a man\u2019s mind can perform that complex, delicate, crucial process of identification which is thinking. Nothing can direct the process but his own judgment. Nothing can direct his judgment but his moral integrity.\n\u201cYou who speak of a \u2018moral instinct\u2019 as if it were some separate endowment opposed to reason-man\u2019s reason is his moral faculty. A process of reason is a process of constant choice in answer to the question: True or False?-Right or Wrong? Is a seed to be planted in soil in order to grow-right or wrong? Is a man\u2019s wound to be disinfected in order to save his life-right or wrong? Does the nature of atmospheric electricity permit it to be converted into kinetic power-right or wrong? It is the answers to such questions that gave you everything you have-and the answers came from a man\u2019s mind, a mind of intransigent devotion to that which is right.\n\u201cA rational process is a moral process. You may make an error at any step of it, with nothing to protect you but your own severity, or you may try to cheat, to fake the evidence and evade the effort of the quest-but if devotion to truth is the hallmark of morality, then there is no greater, nobler, more heroic form of devotion than the act of a man who assumes the responsibility of thinking.\n\u201cThat which you call your soul or spirit is your consciousness, and that which you call \u2018free will\u2019 is your mind\u2019s freedom to think or not, the only will you have, your only freedom, the choice that controls all the choices you make and determines your life and your character.\n\u201cThinking is man\u2019s only basic virtue, from which all the others proceed. And his basic vice, the source of all his evils, is that nameless act which all of you practice, but struggle never to admit: the act of blanking out, the willful suspension of one\u2019s consciousness, the refusal to think-not blindness, but the refusal to see; not ignorance, but the refusal to know. It is the act of unfocusing your mind and inducing an inner fog to escape the responsibility of judgment-on the unstated premise that a thing will not exist if only you refuse to identify it, that A will not be A so long as you do not pronounce the verdict \u2018It is.\u2019 Non-thinking is an act of annihilation, a wish to negate existence, an attempt to wipe out reality. But existence exists; reality is not to be wiped out, it will merely wipe out the wiper. By refusing to say \u2018It is,\u2019 you are refusing to say \u2018I am.\u2019 By suspending your judgment, you are negating your person. When a man declares: \u2018Who am I to know?\u2019-he is declaring: \u2018Who am I to live?\u2019\n\u201cThis, in every hour and every issue, is your basic moral choice: thinking or non-thinking, existence or non-existence, A or non-A, entity or zero.\n\u201cTo the extent to which a man is rational, life is the premise directing his actions. To the extent to which he is irrational, the premise directing his actions is death.\n\u201cYou who prattle that morality is social and that man would need no morality on a desert island-it is on a desert island that he would need it most. Let him try to claim, when there are no victims to pay for it, that a rock is a house, that sand is clothing, that food will drop into his mouth without cause or effort, that he will collect a harvest tomorrow by devouring his stock seed today-and reality will wipe him out, as he deserves; reality will show him that life is a value to be bought and that thinking is the only coin noble enough to buy it.\n\u201cIf I were to speak your kind of language, I would say that man\u2019s only moral commandment is: Thou shalt think. But a \u2018moral commandment\u2019 is a contradiction in terms. The moral is the chosen, not the forced; the understood, not the obeyed. The moral is the rational, and reason accepts no commandments.\n\u201cMy morality, the morality of reason, is contained in a single axiom: existence exists-and in a single choice: to live. The rest proceeds from these. To live, man must hold three things as the supreme and ruling values of his life: Reason-Purpose-Self-esteem. Reason, as his only tool of knowledge-Purpose, as his choice  of the happiness which that tool must proceed to achieve Self esteem^as^his^inviolate^certainty^that^his^mind^is... ",

After crossing the road and gorging itself in a soy-bean crop, the chicken was struck by a furniture removers van as it attempted to make its way home. \nSeveral hours later the dead chicken was spotted by a Community Mental Health Worker who was doing his bi-weekly rural clinic run. The chicken, being a bantam caught the eye of the Mental Health worker, who was a keen trout fisherman. \n\"Cool\" thought the mental health worker- \"those feathers will make for excellent trout flies\".

What are you complaining about, anyway? It's free food, and it's a nice snack. If you're really that bent on not enjoying the peanuts the airline so graciously provided you with, just save them and give them to the next homeless person you see.

It's quite delicious, actually. \n\nWhat's the difference between Michael Jackson and a shopping bag.\nOne is a famous singer songwriter facing charges of child molestation and the other's a thin plastic sheet formed into a shape most fitting to carrying large amounts of shopping so that its easier to carry. \n\nHow many mice does it take to screw in a light-bulb? \nI imagine it would take a great many. Mice would find it difficult to reach a ceiling light fitting, and would individually lack the strength or dexterity required to turn a bulb in such a socket. Even if you had enough mice to lend their strength to such an endeavor, the chances of them having the intelligence and wherewithal to perform such a complex activity is really quite low. \n\nA blonde girl walks into the local dry cleaners. She places a garment on the counter. \"I'll be back tomorrow afternoon to pick up my dress.\" she says. \n\"Come again?\" says the clerk, cupping his ear. \n\"I said 'I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW AFTERNOON TO PICK UP MY DRESS',\" says the girl, this time louder. \n\nA man walks past a bar and sees a sign which says \"PERFORM THE THREE FEATS AND WIN A MILLION DOLLARS!\" Thinking that a million dollars sounds like a great idea, he goes inside and asks the bartender what the deal is. \n\"First,\" says the bartender, \"you have to chug this entire bottle of vodka. Second, there's a crocodile in the back room with a bad tooth. You have to pull it. Third, there's an eighty-five year old woman in the back who's never had sex. You have to have sex with her.\" \nThe guy think it over and says \"okay, sure. You have a deal!\" He grabs the bottle of vodka and, with little effort due to the fact that he's basically a professional alcoholic anyway, downs it. Then he slams the empty bottle down and goes into the back room. There's a lot of screaming, some growling, and various crashing sounds. Finally a silence falls upon the bar. Minutes pass, then an hour. Finally the bartender sends a barmaid back to see what's going on. A few minutes later, she comes back out. \n\"What's he doing?\" asks the bartender. \n\"What's left of him is back there in the croc pen,\" she says, her horrified face pale with shock. \"His clothes are tossed in the corner. I think he tried to fuck the croc. The croc...the croc ate him.\" \n\"Oh, Jesus,\" whispers the bartender. \"Jesus.\" \nNobody says a word. \n\nA man has been trapped on a desert island for 8 years. One day, he sees a boat on the horizon and lights a fire to let it know he is there. \nThe boat comes towards the shore. On board there is a beautiful woman in a body hugging wetsuit. \n\"Thank God\", he says, \"I've been trapped on this island for eight years. Thank god someone has come at last.\" \n\"Eight years?\" she says, \"So it's eight years since you last smoked a Cuban cigar?\" \nShe unzips a pocket on her wetsuit and pulls out a cigar. She passes it to him, pulls out a Zippo, and lights it for him. He enjoys the first cigar he has had in eight years. \n\"So is it also eight years since you had a drink?\" \nShe unzips a pocket on her wetsuit and pulls out a hip flask, tossing it to him. He takes a swig, and it's 25 year old single malt whisky. It's smooth and mellow and utterly delicious. \n\"So,\" she says, beginning to unzip the long zipper on the front of her costume, \"Is it eight years since you played around?\" \n\"Oh no,\" he says, \"This is all a dream, isn't it? A beautiful woman with whiskey and cigars wanting to have sex with me? I must be dreaming.\" \nSuddenly he is woken up by a flash of lightning. It's the middle of the night, and he is all alone in his primitive shelter on his desert island. So alone... so terribly alone. \n\nAn Illinois man left the snowballed streets of Chicago for a vacation in Florida. His wife was on a business trip and was planning to meet him there the next day. When he reached his hotel, he decided to send his wife a quick e-mail. \nUnable to find the spool of paper on which he had written her e-mail address, he did his best to type it in from memory. Unfortunately, he missed one letter, and his note was directed instead to an elderly preacher's wife whose husband had passed away only the day before. When the grieving widow checked her e-mail, she took one look at the monitor, did not recognize the sender's name, and rightly deduced that she was not the intended recipient. She replied, pointing out the man's mistake, who then resent the e-mail to the proper address. \n\nWhat's the difference between a duck? \nI'm sorry, I was typing too quickly and missed off the end of my sentence. I meant to say \"What's the difference between a duck and a goose?\" and the answer is that they are entirely different species of waterfowl. \n\nWhat do you call 5 Mexicans in quicksand?\nA dangerous situation that could soon turn tragic. \n\nFour blondes are driving to Disney world. They finally get to Florida and they see a sign that says \"Disneyworld: left\" so they take the left and have a wonderful time at what many people believe to be the most magical place on Earth. \n\nA Mexican, a Texan, a Brit, and a Frenchman are flying on a plane when one of the engines goes out. The pilot comes out and says \"we're too heavy, one of you will have to jump!\" The Mexican looks at the Texan, the Brit looks at the Frenchmen, but they all decide that they don't want to jump out of the plane. The pilot attempts an emergency landing but without a runway and only 3 engines the plane hits at too harsh an angle and explodes. \n\nHow do you make a blonde's eyes light up? \nDo something really nice for her, like buy her the piece of jewellery she looks at every time you go into the mall, or bake her a cake. If you have the time and effort, make her something. People appreciate thought and effort in a present more than money. \n\nWhy don't Polish girls swim in the sea? \nThe only sea that Poland borders on is the Baltic. Throughout most of the year this sea is too cold to comfortably swim in. \n\nThere once was a man from Nantucket. He owned a sail-boat. I haven't seen him in years. \n\nAs their plane spirals towards the ground, a young man asks the pretty girl next to him if she would have sex with him, as he does not want to die a virgin. Surprised by this request, she declines, stating that in addition to the sheer inappropriateness of the idea, the mechanics of copulating in a crashing aircraft seem very difficult if not impossible. He agrees and admits that he was only trying to lighten the mood. However, she was busy putting on her oxygen mask and didn't hear this last bit. They both spend the last moments of their lives in anxious reflection.\n\nA man walks into a bar. \nHe orders a couple of drinks, pays for them, and then proceeds to leave the premises, as his wife had told him that he must not be too late home.\n\nA horse walks into a bar.\nThe barman immediately calls the local stable to report the missing stallion, and his owner promptly arrives to take him home. He thanks the landlord and offers a small reward, but it is respectfully declined.\n\nWhat's eighteen inches long, stiff, and makes women scream at night?\nA twelve inch long penis that is erect, thus adding approximately one half of its flaccid size, and involved in the act of fornication with the female partner of the man whose penis I am describing. (Of course, it is ignorant and juvenile to assume that the man in question is heterosexual. He may be a homosexual, which is perfectly acceptable in these liberal times we live in, or he may in fact be single and not inclined towards a sexual preference of any kind. This is understandable due to the myriad complications of long-term relationships, a result of the infinite differences between the masculine and feminine psyches.)\n\nPATIENT: Doctor doctor, I feel like a pair of curtains!\nDOCTOR: I shall prescribe you some anti-depressant tablets, probably 20 milligrams to start with, and I shall book you an appointment with a psychiatrist. You will not be charged for his or her services, but you may have to wait up to seven weeks for your first meeting. I shall give you two prescriptions just in case, so that you don't run the risk of running out of medication and thus relapsing. You will have to return in two months as your counsellor is unable to provide you with drugs. Have a nice day.\nPATIENT: Thank you, doctor. My mother will be pleased and relieved that I have finally sought your advice after many years of this inner personal anguish and turmoil.\nDOCTOR: You're very welcome. Could you please send my next patient in? He should have a large beard, unless he recently has shaved it, which I consider unlikely.\nPATIENT: Certainly, doctor. And thank you again.\n\nWhat's the difference between Smarties and sleeping pills?\nSmarties are a popular chocolate-based confectionery product from England, which were the inspiration for the arguably more successful M&M's produced by Mars. Sleeping pills are flavourless narcotics that are used primarily by people suffering from afflictions such as insomnia. Another difference between the two is the repercussions of ingestion. In a large dose, Smarties can have a minor contribution to obesity, whereas a large dose - often referred to as an 'overdose' - of sleeping pills runs the risk of much more dangerous consequences such as immediate and fatal liver damage. It is generally accepted that sleeping pills should only be used when recommended or prescribed by a qualified doctor or chemist, but Smarties can be purchased at the majority of reputable supermarkets or corner shops.\n\nWhy did the Czech tourist cross the road?\nBecause he was impressed by the frankly excellent crossing facilities on major German routeways, compared to the relatively poor facilities constructed by his own Czech government.\n\nHow many Germans does it take to change a light-bulb?\nOnly one. It is a simple light-bulb, not an advanced 'home computer'.\n\nKnock Knock\nWho is there please?\nBoo\nI do not know anyone by that name. Unless you mean to startle me with the word 'boo', in which case you are quite unsuccessful. I see no need to open my door in either case.\n\nDoctor Doctor! I think I've broken my leg!\nYes, I'm afraid it's a terrible break, the chances are you'll never walk again.\n\nWhy can't women leave the kitchen to empty the bins out?\nThey can, providing that they are familiar with the efficient German rubbish sorting guidelines. There are separate collections for green glass, white glass and brown glass. Recycling rubbish goes in yellow bags that are collected by yellow trucks, newspapers go in cardboard boxes that are collected by gray vehicles, other rubbish is collected every two weeks by various private firms. \n\nHow can you tell that your girlfriend's too young for you?\nOften the level of rapport induced from conversations and activities is dependant on sharing mutual interests and beliefs. A significant age gap can compromise this, although it is not a concrete determiner of a relationship's potential success. Another thing to take into account is that the legal age for consensual sex is 16, although it is often (wrongly) considered a taboo for a man of 20 years or older to date a lady who is less than 18, the minimum legal age for drinking in the United Kingdom. However, when the roles are reversed it can be considered a positive trait for a younger man to have a mature partner.\n\nWhat do you call a man with a tray on his head?\nIf you are aware of his given name, you may address him with this. If he had adopted a nickname by which he is comfortable to be known, using this would also be deemed acceptable. If, however, you do not already know what his name is, ask him to kindly inform you so that you may become acquainted. You may then ask him why he has a tray on his head, and he will quite likely answer you with humility and direct earnest.\n\nAn Englishman, an Irishman, and a Scotsman walk into a bar. They have a few drinks, then go to a club, where they amuse each other and those around them by completely slurring their words in their already very strong regional accents. Then they get a taxi back to the house of the Englishman as he lives nearest, and stay the night. The next morning, the Scotsman and the Irishmen walk home as they are still hungover and do not wish to risk driving.\n\n",

I must warn you, our programs are very expensive, but that's because they really work.

After handing her a check for $10,000, the woman behind the counter directed him to a large empty room and shut the door behind him.\n\nAll of the sudden, a door opened and the most beautiful woman the man had ever seen walked through the door, a smile on her face, totally naked. A sign gently hung from her neck in front of her which read:\n\n\u201cYou catch me, you fuck me.\"\n\nThe man ran and ran and ran and ran after the woman, but just could not catch her. Finally he stopped, out of breath, unable to continue. The next week, he came back to the weight loss center, and couldn\u2019t wait to begin another session. As he approached the counter, the woman said to him: \u201cYou know, if you enjoyed program A, we do have program B if you're interested. It\u2019s even better than program A, but it's $20,000.\"\n\n\u201cEven better than program A!?\u201d What could be better than that woman he chased? Two women? Three? \u201cIt must be better if it\u2019s twice the price! I\u2019ll take it!\"\n\nSo he wrote a check for $20,000 and the woman showed him back into the same room as before. A door opened again. This time a giant, angry, hairy, snorting gorilla walked into the room. It too had a sign around it\u2019s neck, which said:\n\n\u201cI catch you, I fuck you.\u201d",

The woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.\n\nAn English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, \"You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing.

        "body": "So, you're in love with one of your friends, but she has a boyfriend and probably wouldn't have sex with you anyway.\n\nWhat you will need: 1 x knife, 1 x ring, access to a sunbed, the ability to grow a beard.\n\nStep One: Place the ring on your wedding finger and avoid contact with your friend for a month.\n\nStep Two: Stop shaving and use the sunbed to gain a tan.\n\nStep Three: After a month when your beard is full and your tan is noticeable, remove the ring from your finger.\n\nStep Four: Remove all your clothes and break into your friend's house.\n\nStep Five: Use the knife to cut your body in various places. Avoid the face. If possible, focus on your back. The more blood the better.\n\nStep Six: Enter your friend's bedroom and lie face down on the floor. Wait for her return.\n\nStep Seven: When she enters the room pretend to be unconscious. Allow her to turn you over and try to wake you for a few seconds before you open your eyes. The injuries to your body will serve as a distraction to your nakedness. She will be more concerned about your wellbeing instead of fearing the naked man in her room.\n\nStep Eight: When she asks you what's happened you should ignore her questions. Instead you must act confused and ask the date. If it's September 15th she will say 'September 15th' to which you must reply 'No, what year is it?'\n\nStep Nine: Upon hearing the year say the words 'It worked.' Pretend to lose consciousness again for a few seconds, implying that whatever it is that has worked took a great effort.\n\nStep Ten: If your friend is a curious person she will probably ask 'What worked?', even if she doesn't ask this question it is important that you now say the words '(Insert Friend's Name), I'm from the future' in your most deadpan voice.\n\nStep Eleven: Pause for ten seconds to allow the incrediblness of the situation to sink in. There will be no reason for her to doubt your claim, because your beard will make you appear many years older and your cuts would add weight to the idea that you've come from a post-apocalyptic future where a war is currently taking place.\n\nStep Twelve: Raise your left hand to your face. All women are very observant, so your friend will immediately notice the tanline on your wedding finger. If she is educated to a decent standard she will realise that you are married and your ring has simply disappeared, because clothing and other items cannot travel through time. Your nudity will support this.\n\nStep Thirteen: Now comes the hard part - The monologue. In your own words you must give a speech in which you mention all of these key points:\n\na) You are married to each other in the future\nb) Her current boyfriend is dead\nc) The world is coming to an end. It's up to you to pick a reason, but I would recommend a war against machines. This whole situation will be backed up by the Terminator franchise\nd) In the future your relationship is not going well\ne) You've come back in time because you can't help but feel that she would have been happier with her current boyfriend if he hadn't been killed\nf) Her current boyfriend is going to be hit by a bus on a day six months from her present. She should stop him going to work that day\ng) If she does exactly what you say this current version of yourself will be erased and you will never get married. If she questions this flaw in your time travel logic, because you cannot change the past, simply reference Back to the Future\n\nStep Fourteen: Unless your friend is made of stone she will now be overcome by emotion, especially at your selflessness. Get to your feet and go to kiss her goodbye. It is important that you do this with the confidence of a man who has done this to her many times.\n\nStep Fifteen: There is now no possible way that you aren't about to have sex with her. You're naked, kissing her, in her bedroom, agreeing to erase a version of yourself from history to make her happy. And as far as she knows you've had sex many times in a future that will no longer happen, so she thinks to herself that maybe she should have one memory of it.\n\nStep Sixteen: After having the sex, ask to borrow some clothes then leave.\n\nStep Seventeen: Shave off your beard and coat your wedding finger in fake tan. Carry on as if nothing has happened. There will be three possible outcomes:\n\n1) During the sex some feelings that she didn't know existed are awakened and she will leave her boyfriend for you.\n2) Life will carry on as normal.\n3) You will be filled with guilt because of this moral grey area where you aren't entirely sure if what you've done counts as some kind of low level rape. You will take your own life by hanging, overdose or wrist cutting.",

I've been finding real passion with Stacy, and she is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of her piercings, tattoos, tight motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older than I am. But it's not only the passion, Dad. She's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children. Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves, and trading it with the other people in the commune, for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want. In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS, so Stacy can get better. She sure deserves it! Don't worry, Dad. I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself.

He chugged the two flasks of whiskey as fast as he could while he was floating down to the ground, after that he took his six shooter and fired it a few times, managing to kill the son of a bitch who'd shot him down.\n\nWhen he got down to the ground, he used the last few bullets to shoot some Korean soldiers who tried to take him prisoner, then he used his knife to make a man give him his truck after he cut his balls off so he could escape back to his base. \"\n\n\"Wow, Johnny\" said his teacher \"That's a very amazing story, but I'm not sure I get what the moral of it is.\"\n\n\"Oh\" Johnny said, almost forgetting to add \"Don't fuck with grandpa after he's been drinking\"",

The englishman goes off to the bathroom to have a good old go at the porcelain, he's back and ready for a few more whiskeys. He's just sat down when suddenly in the distance he hears a scream. He looks over his shoulder and dismisses it as nothing, he turns to the barkeep and orders a drink, takes a sip and hears the scream again. He looks at the barkeep who just shrugs it off. A minute or two later he and the barman hear it again and go outside to take a look. They see a lone figure running towards them screaming, he spots them and lets out a cry, RUN!!!!! HE\"S COMING!!!!! \n\nThe barkeep and the Englishman both look at the terrified bedraggled sight before them, and try to calm him down, but he's completely inconsolable. They give him water and finally manage to get a word out of him but he struggles free from their grasp and run away screaming. \n\nA few minutes later the same thing happens with a whole group of men running in and screaming, he's coming, he's coming the barkeep grabs hold of one of the men as he tries to sprint past the bar and tries to get information out of him, again no response other than terrified gibberish. \n\nThe barkeep and his customer are starting to get worried, they start to pack up before another group of horrified natives run up to the bar most of them flee but one tries to hide behind the bar, the barkeep pulls out a shotgun and points it at the terrified man's face, finally managing to coax some words out of him. \"He's coming for us, Vernon Koekemoer is coming for us, we have to hide!!! We have to get out of here.\" He gets up and tries to run but the barkeep grabs him, feeling trapped in a panic he grabs the barkeeps shotgun and blows his own head off. The Englishman and the barkeep look at each other starting to really panic now. \n\nThey look out of the window and off in the distance they see a tornado coming towards the bar, at the bottom of the tornado they see the hugest beast of a man they have ever seen, as he gets closer they spot that he is riding a rhinocerous and using a crocodile as a riding whip, with each smack of the crocodile across the back of the rhino the louder is screams and the faster it runs, the tornado following it getting ever larger. \n\nThe 2 look at each other and start to fortify their position, they've got a gun and they're waaay to drunk to run, so they start piling bar stool and tables and anything they can get their hands on to make sure they'll be safe when he arrives. They're not gonna make it, they can see the man slowing down his rhino, by now the crocodile is nothing but reptile paste on the bruised rump of the half dead rhino, the rhino drops down dead from exhaustion and crashes to the ground right outside the bar the tornado loses it's last breath in a cloud of dust as the huge man crashes his way through the make shift barricade and charges up towards the bar where the 2 men have taken shelter, he grabs a bottle of the hardest liquor on the shelf and down the entire litre in 1 gulp, he peers over the bar sobbing and sees the 2 defenders cowering down behind the crates of beer, they look up at the mans' face and he stares at them with a look of complete and utter hopelessness, he stares at them for a half second and half screams, half sobs, \"Oh my god what are you still doing here!!!

A second man walks past more desperate this time she asks \"PLEASE MR can you do me?!\u201d The man pays no attention and keeps walking. Some time passes and finally one more man walks by her. \"PLEASE MR! WOULD YOU FUCK ME?!?! I want to feel like it like to be fucked!!!\" The man looks down at the women and to her joy picks her up... He carries the women down the beach to the water and tosses her in and claims: \"now you\u2019re fucked\"",

We'll be growing it for ourselves, and trading it with the other people in the commune, for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want. \nIn the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS, so Stacy can get better.

Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit, so you can get to know your many grandchildren. \nLove, your son, Joshua.\nP.S. Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Jason's house.

The guy gets his free drinks for the night.\n\nA couple of months later the guy is travelling by the town again and stops in and sees the line again and is excited for another night of free drinks.\n\nHowever, the bartender warns him, \"Sorry bud, but you are a heavy drinker and put me in the red big time. And, obviously, the horse is unbalanced now, so we changed the rules. Now you got to make the horse cry.\"\n\nThe guy accepts, goes in and, within a minute the horse is crying inconsolably. Ears down, head to the ground, completely depressed!\n\nThe bartender is not happy \"Allright, you are gonna break me, but please tell me how the hell are you doing this to the horse?!\"\n\n\"Well, first time I told him I had a bigger dick than him\"\n\n\"I can see how that would make him laugh\" said the bartender, \"but how about making him cry?\"\n\n\"I showed it to him....\"",

The pastor looked skeptical, but told the man the job was his if he wanted it. After a few weeks, the man's face was bruised, nose was broken, and eyes were practically swelled shut. He climbed up to the steeple and prepared for the 3 o'clock ring. The first bell,BANG, he hit. The second bell,BANG, he hit.

Is that all? says the therapist. No when I was over there in order to keep up with them I would have to swing from branch to branch to avoid treacherous and dangerous terrain and this caused me to form large and ruff calluses on my hands. And the woman they don't like the touch and caress of my rough hands on there skin. Is that all says the therapist? No these women seem to get offended and disgusted at me when I ask them to shove bananas up my ass.

He is swept up in the obscene madness of the crowd and has a fantastic time.  He's buzzing so much from the fight he's seen that he decides to have dinner in the little restaurant attached to the side of the bull arena.\n\nHis Spanish is not as fantastic as it might be, so he is wrestling with the menu for a good long time trying to decipher it and decide what he wants to eat, when a big fanfare erupts from the kitchen.  A parade of waiters clinking bottles and singing is followed by a few kitchen staff carrying a large platter of food, pasta dumplings with rich fennel sausage, roasted tomatoes and capers in a creamy sauce, topped with two baseball-sized meatballs.  It looks and smells fantastic.  The parade deposits the magnificent looking dish at a nearby table, finishes their song, and then retreats to their responsibilities while the couple at the table rhapsodizes about the fantastic food that they are now ingesting.\n\nEddie signals his waiter and says \"I'd like to have that dish over there, but I don't see it on the menu,\" to which his waiter replies, \"Oh especialle de casa! Mui excellente choice senor, but unfortunate to say, of those I have only one a day.\"\n\nEddie's face is incredulous, and disappointed, so the waiter placates him saying \"if you will return tomorrow, you may have the especialle.  Come at seven and I will serve you.\"\n\nEddie spends the next day going to museums and seeing churches and public buildings built before the reformation, but all day is thinking about his dinner at the bull-fighting ring cafe.\n\nFinally, evening rolls around and Eddie returns to the restaurant.  The waiter pours him a glass of Spanish wine and seats him at a very nice table near the street.\n\nBefore long, the anticipated fanfare starts in the kitchen again, and the waiters and kitchen staff parade to Eddie's table, singing and clinking glasses and bottles, carrying the large platter with them, but when they set the platter down on the table, Eddie notices immediately that while the rest of the dish is the same - dumplings, sausage, capers, cream sauce - the meatballs are only the size of small bird eggs.  He decides not to make a big deal out of it and tucks right in to his dinner, and it is magnificent as he expected it to be.\n\nAs he is just finishing his dessert and a glass of port, his waiter returns to the table with the bill, and asks \"Was everything to your satisfaction, senor?\" to which Eddie replies \"well, yeah... but I have one question: yesterday, the meatballs on this dish were the size of baseballs, but today, they were much smaller, why?\"\n\nThe waiter blushes a little and says \"Oh yes, sir.

What about your son?\u201d\n\nThe fourth man replied: \u201cMy son is Gay and he makes a living dancing as a stripper at a nightclub.\u201d\n\nThe three friends said: \u201cWhat a shame that must be, that is horrible, what a disappointment you must feel.\u201d\n\nThe fourth man replied: \u201cNo, I am not ashamed. Not at all. He is my son and I love him just as well, he is my pride and joy. In addition, he is very lucky too. Did you know that his birthday just passed and the other day he received a beautiful 30,000 sq. ft. mansion, a brand new jet, and a top of the line Mercedes Benz from his three boyfriends?\u201d\n",

What I will do for you is this: We just received 8 shiney brand new  robot golf caddies. If you\u2019re willing to take one with you out on the course and come back and tell me how well it works, your round of golf is on me today.\u201d\n\nThe golfer obviously accepted the man\u2019s offer. He approached the first tee, looked at the fairway and said to himself, \u201cI think my driver will do the job.\u201d\n\nThe robot caddie turned to the man and said, \u201cNo sir. Use your 3 wood. A driver is far too much club for this hole.\u201d\n\nHesitantly, the golfer pulled out his 3 wood, made good contact with the ball, and the ball landed about 10 feet to the right front of the hole on the green. The golfer, delighted, turned to the robot and thanked him for his assistance.\n\nAs the golfer pulled out his putter he said, \u201cI think this green is gonna break left to right.\u201d\n\nThe robot then again spoke up and said, \u201cNo sir. I do believe this green will break right to left\u201d\n\nThinking about the last time the robot corrected his prediction, he decided again to listen to the machine. He made his putt and birdied the hole thanks to the robot and his advice.\n\nBut his luck didn\u2019t end there. His entire game was the best game he ever played, thanks to the assistance of the new robot golf caddie.\n\nUpon returning to the clubhouse, the man behind the counter asked, \u201cHow was your game?\u201d\n\nThe golfer stated, \u201cIt was, by far, the BEST game I ever played. Thank you very much for letting me take one of your robots. See you next week.\u201d\n\nA week passed, and excited, the golfer returned to the pro shop. Upon entering, he turned to the man behind the counter and said, \u201cI would like 18 holes of golf and one of those robot golf caddies, please.\u201d\n\nThe gentleman from behind the counter turned to the man and said, \u201cWell the 18 holes is no problem. However, we no longer have the robots. We had too many complaints.\u201d\n\nConfused, the golfer cried, \u201cCOMPLAINTS? Who in the heck could\u2019ve complained about those robots? They were incredible\u201d\n\nThe man sighed and said, \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t their performance. It was that they were made of shiny silver metal, and the sun reflecting off them was blinding to other golfers on the fair way.\u201d\n\nThe golfer said, \u201cSo then why didn\u2019t you just paint them black?\u201d\n\nThe man nodded sadly and replied, \u201cWe did. Then four of \u2018em didn\u2019t show up for work, two filed for welfare, one of them robbed the pro shop, and the last one was arrested for trying to sell drugs to the customers.",

I know you've heard these.. and I know that you're sick of them ALL\n\n1. \u201cWow, that color looks great on you!\u201d\nSeriously?? my physical appearance is so horribly disturbing to you that you had to resort to the color of my SHIRT to find something nice to say?! Next time do us both a favor and keep the \"compliments\" to yourself, thanks.\n2. \u201cI\u2019m going to dinner tonight, what restaurant would you recommend?\u201d\nTHE LITERAL HELL! This one really gets under my skin. I get it okay? I can\u2019t cook, so yeah, I eat out a lot. That doesn\u2019t even begin to come close to being any of your business. And it certainly doesn\u2019t make me the top authority on local hot spots, so have some respect.\n3. \u201cAre you going to the staff meeting?\u201d\nUmm... yes. Unlike the parties that you clearly assume I\u2019m never invited to, I was in fact invited to the staff meeting. I am indeed staff.\n4. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you came\u201d\nthis is nothing more than the adult equivalent of a participation ribbon.\n\n5. \u201cHow do you take your coffee\u201d\nYes, please let me give you this information so that you can take it and use it to judge me.  We all know that you only want to hear my answer so that you can tell me that I must not realllyy like coffee since I don\u2019t drink it black.  Drink your black coffee all day for all I care. Well here\u2019s a news flash for you... no one cares if you drink black coffee. It doesn\u2019t make you better than me, and I\u2019m fairly confident that hell isn\u2019t currently filled with poor souls who enjoyed a little cream in their coffee, so don\u2019t condemn me just yet my friend!\n6. \u201cHow was your trip?\u201d\nThe only thing more nauseating than this question is the fake little smile on your face when you ask it.\n7. \u201cDid you do something new with your hair? There\u2019s something different about you!\u201d\nNobody uses the word \u201cdifferent\u201d in this context unless the word that they actually want to use is \u201cworse\u201d.  If you meant better you would say \u201cyou look amazing!\u201d or \u201cwow, stunning!\u201d. Here\u2019s the thing\u2026 you said neither of those things.  I will now spend the rest of the day (or week) regretting whatever decision it was I made that is clearly so awful that you felt the need to so inconsiderately comment on. \n8. \u201cCan I get the recipe for this? It\u2019s delicious!\nThis leaves me to draw one of only two conclusions: Either you honestly did like the dish, but you never want to invite me anywhere ever again where I could personally make and bring it again for you, or you\u2019re throwing me a pity card, which you may think makes you look like a great hostess but come on\u2026 you aren't Martha Stewart and you aren\u2019t fooling anyone. \n9. \u201cCan I buy you lunch\u201d \nClearly you\u2019re either hitting on me or you think that I can\u2019t afford to feed myself. I can think of absolutely no other reason why you would ask me this. \n10.  \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea!\u201d \nYou know what?! It probably was a great idea. It wouldn't be the first one that I've had and it most likely won\u2019t be the last, so don\u2019t patronize me with an over-exuberant exclamation about my thought\u2019s merit like I\u2019m your poor adopted puppy from the bad streets of Harlem or something.  And while I\u2019m on it, consider one more thing:  even if my idea was the most ridiculous thing that\u2019d you\u2019d ever heard... I wouldn't care. Even if, for the sake of argument, I\u2019d suggested that I might shave my head this weekend, dye my skin army green and quit my job to become a dolphin trainer, that would still be\u2026 wait for it\u2026 none of your business. \n\nAnd finally, now that I\u2019m good and riled up, I\u2019ve saved the most offensive for last. It is none other than:\n11. \u201cHi\u201d\nI guess the extra syllable in \u201chello\u201d would just be too much for you?  \n\n \n",

He baits the hook for him and says, \"Give it a shot father\". \n\nAfter a few minutes, the priest hooks a big fish and struggles to get it in the boat. \n\nThe fisherman says \"Whoa, what a big sonofabitch!\" \n\nThe priest rebukes the fisherman, \"Uh, please sir, can you mind your language?\" \n\nQuickly thinking, the fisherman says, \"I'm sorry father, but that's what this fish is called - a sonofabitch! They're very delicious. Why don't you take it back to the church.\" \n\nApologetically, the priest says \"Oh, I'm sorry - I didn't know. Thank you for letting me keep the fish.\" \n\nAfter the trip, the priest brings the fish to the church and spots the bishop. \n\nThe priest says to the Bishop, \"Look at this big sonofabitch I caught!\" \n\nThe Bishop then rebukes the priest, \"Please, mind your language, this is a house of God.\" \n\nTo which the priest responds \"No, you don't understand - that's what this fish is called, and I caught it. I caught this sonofabitch!\" \n\n\"Hmmm. You know, I could clean this sonofabitch and we could have it for dinner,\" says the Bishop, So he takes the fish and cleans it, and brings it to the head mother. \n\n\"Head Mother, could you cook this sonofabitch for dinner tonight?\" asks the Bishop.\n\nShocked, the Head Mother replies, \"My lord, what language!\" \n\nThe Bishop corrects the nun, \"No, sister, that's what the fish is called - a sonofabitch! Father caught it, I cleaned it, and we'd like you to cook it.\" \n\nAssured, the Head Mother says, \"Hmmm. Yes, I'll cook that sonofabitch tonight.\" \n\nLittle did they know that the Pope just happened to drop by for an unannounced visit to the church. It seemed like an act of Providence that they had a delicious freshly caught meal to serve him.

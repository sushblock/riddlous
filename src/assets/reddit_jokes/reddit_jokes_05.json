However, one day as he was settling down to watch his favourite shows with a mug of hot cocoa, he saw on the weather channel that a horrible storm was headed in his direction. He thought nothing of it and went to bed later that night. In the early hours of the morning, however, he was awoken by a loud banging on his front door, he threw on his robe and slippers before running downstairs to answer the door. Upon opening the door he was met by a homeless man who asked for refuge during the storm as his home was the only shelter for miles. Being a religious and kind man, the Monk saw to the homeless man and gave him the spare bed before going back to bed. The next morning the Monk decided he would treat the homeless man to breakfast in bed as he figured he had been through a lot. He knocked on the spare bedroom door, although there was no answer. He entered the room and immediately dropped his prepared breakfast in horror as he saw that there was blood smeared on the bed and the curtains, no sight of the homeless man and a tiny pickle in a jar in the corner of the room. Perplexed and with no explanation, the Monk proceeded to clean the mess and carry on with his life, trying to explain this unfortunate series of events to himself. The next night the Monk was once again awoken by a loud banging on his front door. When he answered he was confronted by another homeless man also seeking refuge. Once again here obliged and provided shelter. The next morning he went to check on his guest and found the exact same scene he saw the previous morning. Blood stained curtains and bed sheets, no sign of his guest and a tiny little pickle in a jar in the corner of the room. The Monk vowed to not allow this to happen again and after cleaning up the mess and going to bed the following night, He was awoken one final time by a banging on his front door and immediately answered it exclaiming \"no no no! You cannot stay here, I will not allow another catastrophe in my home!\". To his surprise, the Monk noticed he was not speaking to a homeless man, but rather a small gentlemen with a long beard and pointy hat. The man said \"listen here, Monk. Do you want to know why every time you let a homeless person seek refuge in your house, you wind up with blood stained curtains and bed sheets, the absence of a guest and a tiny little pickle in a jar in the corner of the room?\". \"YES! More than anything! Please tell me!\", the Monk gasped. The man replied, \"I shall tell you, but you must promise not to tell another living soul as long as you live.\". \"I promise\", said the Monk. \n\nAnd he never did.",

They'd just finished a $5 million remodeling job, and now it's a jewel, the finest hotel in the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us their owner's suite at no extra charge!\"\n\n\"Well,\" muttered the hairdresser, \"that's all well and good, but I know you didn't get to see the Pope.\"\n\n\"Actually, we were quite lucky, because as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder, and explained that the Pope likes to meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait, the Pope would personally greet me.\n\nSure enough, five minutes later, the Pope walked through the door and shook my hand!

How much is he?\" \n\n\"Well, with the cage, he's 400 dollars. Trust me, we have the best places in town.\" She replies.\n\nAfter some quick thought he pulled out his credit card and let her swipe it. Took the bird home, even named him Elvis because, well, he wasnt very creative. The bird did have sort of a stylish hairdoo.\n\nOnce he gets the bird set up in the living room he stands by the cage trying to get Elvis to talk. to no avail. The bird just stares at him. Turning his head from side to side as the man says the things he thinks the bird wants to hear. This goes on for a day. He gets angry and takes the bird back to the store. \n\"Ma'am I'm sorry i have to return this bird. It refuses to talk.\"\nThe owner replies, \"well, did you buy the little ladder?\"\n\"The little ladder.\" Says our man. \n\n\"Yeah the little ladder,\" the store owner replies, \"you buy the little ladder and he climbs up to the top of it and he feels like hes on top of the world and it makes him want to sing. The little ladder is necessary. He loves the little ladder\"\n\nThe man, now feeling ignorant, says \"okay ill take it\"\n\n\"30 bucks\"\n\nHe pays and leaves\n\nAt home the bird is happy to have the little ladder, he loves the little ladder. Hes climbing up and down the little ladder. But hes still not saying a,word. \n\nThe next morning the bird is still scilent and the man is back at the store \"look this bird is not gonna talk. I want my money back.\" \n\n\"Sorry no refunds. Also, i notice you dont have the little bell in your cage. You buy a little bell for the top of your little ladder and the bird rings the little bell and then he knows what key to sing in for you. He wouldnt want to be flat. Without the little bell the little ladder is useless.\" Said the owner.\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"$47.99\" \n\nHe reluctantly pays and returns home. \n\nThis bird is just climbing the little ladder and ringing the bell but not singing a single note.\nUp, *ding*, down. Up. *ding.* down.\n\nLast time. Hes at the store. Trying to contain his frustration he says, \"why isnt this bird talking. I paid for a talking bird and it doesnt talk. I bought the little ladder, the little bell and he still wont talk to me.\"\n\n\"Sir, please reamin calm. This will all be fine. You just need a little mirror.\"\n\n\"A LITTLE MIRROR?\"\n\n\"Yes sir, he climbs the little ladder, rings the little bell, looks in the mirror and thinks *'oh thats a good lookinf bird'* and stars to serenade its new friend. I know youre upset so ill give you 25% off this mirror, it will only be 75 dollars.\"\n\n\nAt this point the man is desperate and will do anything to get this damn bird to talk. He buys the damn mirror and leaves.\n\nHe gets home and sets the little mirror up next to the little bell at the top of the little ladder. \n\n\"Okay bird, *Elvis*, say something. Say anything. Talk. To. Me.\"\n\nElvis climbs the little ladder. Rings the little bell. Looks in the little mirror long and hard just before he collapses to the cage floor. Elvis locks eyes with the man and says \"hey, they have a little bird seed at that store?\" And dies.\n\n\n\nHoly shit im so sorry.\n\n\n",

        "body": "So, there's a man crawling through the desert.\n\nHe'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.\n\nHe stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.\n\nHe thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So, he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the direction he thinks is right.\n\nHe walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.\n\nHe pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.\n\nBy the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.\n\nAs it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things, he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.\n\nFull dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.\n\nHe wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.\n\nHe knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.\n\nHe rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.\n\nThen he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.\n\nLooking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.\n\nAs he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.\n\nHe decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle. He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to make some difference and keep himself from passing out.\n\nHe's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him, it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.\n\nHe walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills, dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water. Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.\n\nAfter a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.\n\nAfter more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it, trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.\n\nHe was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.\n\nHe walks through the sand.\n\nAfter a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.\n\nBut, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.\n\nHalfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.\n\nWhile crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape - shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.\n\nHe finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top, he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.\n\nAgain, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from here. He's going to have to go down there and look.\n\nHe puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune. After a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.\n\nHe stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.\n\nSo, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last chance.\n\nHe gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just keeps crawling.\n\nFinally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center, where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone area.\n\nHis mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun overhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying down on the nice cool surface.\n\nCool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him a drink. Then he'll know he's gone.\n\nHe decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the center before he goes. He keeps crawling.\n\nIt's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's hearing. He would swear that someone just said, \"Greetings, traveler. You do not look well. Do you hear me?\"\n\nHe stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and knees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something different - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands and tries again. Better this time.\n\nYep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet out of the stone, at an angle.\n\nAnd wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.\n\nHe stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to move from this spot.\n\nWell, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.\n\nHmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet - that was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.\n\nHe then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here because he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was likely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was now on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake was even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.\n\nHe tries to clear his throat to say, \"Hello,\" but his throat is too dry. All that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out, almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't good. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes out.\n\nHe gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips, and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk now.\n\nHe tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to spot the owner of this place, and croaks out, \"Hello? Is there anyone here?\"\n\nHe hears, from his side, \"Greetings. What is it that you want?\"\n\nHe turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides to try asking for help.\n\n\"Please,\" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, \"I'd love to not be thirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?\"\n\nLooking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its mouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he falls forward, face first on the stone, \"Very well. Coming up.\"\n\nA piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped around the tilted white post, still looking at him.\n\nHe reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet. He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes - they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been bitten. By the snake.\n\n\"It'll feel better in a minute.\" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more importantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!\n\n\"Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the afterlife?\"\n\n\"Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,\" says the snake. \"That's the way I work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.\"\n\n\"You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be thirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk? Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?\"\n\n\"No,\" says the snake, \"I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just sitting around here.\"\n\nThe man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer dying of thirst.\n\n\"I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your system with the next request,\" continued the snake. \"I can guess why you drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or two, if you drank enough of it.\"\n\n\"Ummm, n-next request?\" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.\n\n\"That's the way it works. If you like, that is,\" explained the snake. \"You get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish.\" The snake grinned at his own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.\n\n\"But there are rules,\" the snake continued. \"The first request is free. The second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of responsibility.\" The snake looks at the man seriously.\n\n\"By the way,\" the snake says suddenly, \"my name is Nathan. Old Nathan, Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound used to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into names. You can call me Nate, if you wish.\" Again, the snake grinned. \"Sorry if I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds somewhat threatening.\" The snake give his rattle a little shake.\n\n\"Umm, my name is Jack,\" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. \"Jack Samson.\n\n\"Can I ask you a question?\" Jack says suddenly. \"What happened to the poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that? What do you mean by that's how you work?\"\n\n\"That's more than one question,\" grins Nate. \"But I'll still try to answer all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question.\" The snake's grin gets wider. \"Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need to drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not be thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert. You've been changed.\n\n\"For the third question,\" Nate continues, \"you are still dying. Besides the effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal. In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years. Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is.\" Nate seemed vastly amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.\n\n\"As for the fourth question,\" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, \"first you have to agree to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell you.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" joked Jack, \"isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd have to kill me?\"\n\n\"I thought that was implied.\" Nate continued to look serious.\n\n\"Ummm...yeah.\" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was talking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a nasty temper. \"So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really stop the effects of the methanol?\" Jack thought for a second. \"And, what do you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper fluid, and just denature it?\"\n\n\"They may, I don't really know,\" said Nate. \"I haven't gotten out in a while. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and on that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you pulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume that they still color wiper fluid blue?\"\n\n\"Yeah, they do,\" said Jack.\n\n\"I figured,\" replied Nate. \"As for being bound by secrecy - with the fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me, this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me, write about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will lead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding anyway, so you won't notice.\" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.\n\nJack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a little nervous at this. \"Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?\"\n\nWell, Jack,\" said Nate sadly, \"I can't tell you that, unless you make the second request.\" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.\n\n\"Umm, well, ok,\" said Jack, \"what is this about a second request? What can I ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?\"\n\n\"Sure!\" said Nate, brightening. \"You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes to yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and before you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or omnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous and yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and sort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be omniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very useful, at least in my opinion.\" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was staring at him.\n\n\"Well, anyway,\" continued Nate, \"I'd probably suggest giving you permanent good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long time, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to recover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a request to me.\"\n\n\"Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?\" said Jack. \"And keep me healthy for a long time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request about a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not really a change to me?\"\n\n\"Right,\" nodded Nate.\n\n\"Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?\" Jack asked, hopefully.\n\n\"That takes two requests, Jack.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I figured so,\" said Jack. \"But I could ask to be a genius? I could become the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?\"\n\n\"Well, I could make you very smart,\" admitted Nate, \"but that wouldn't necessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you very athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either. You've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some truth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It all depends on what you decide to do with it.\"\n\n\"Hmmm,\" said Jack. \"Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request, after this one?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Nate, \"it depends on what you decide then. There are more rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second request. You know how it goes.\" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had shoulders.\n\n\"Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent health doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially. Do I need to sign in blood or something?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Nate. \"Just hold out your hand. Or heel.\" Nate grinned. \"Or whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said, that's how it works - the poison, you know,\" Nate said apologetically.\n\nJack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it didn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better about the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot snake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to be able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack tried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it wouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.\n\n\"Hey, Jack,\" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind him, \"is that someone else coming up over there?\"\n\nJack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of nowhere? And did they bring food?\n\nWait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...\n\nJack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through his jeans...\n\nJack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. \"I would have decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to hoodwink me like that.\"\n\n\"I've been doing this a long time, Jack,\" said Nate, confidently. \"You humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you - especially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of minutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the health benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, still,\" said Jack, \"it's the principle of the thing. And nobody likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or something instead?\"\n\n\"More meat in the typical human butt,\" replied Nate. \"And less chance you accidentally kick me or move at the last second.\"\n",

He goes to the balcony and finds a man hanging from the edge 6 stories up completely naked.  The naked man pleads with him to pull him up but the husband forces the man's hands free causing him to fall.\n\nMiraculously the naked man's fall was cushioned by the bushes below only giving him a few scraps.  In a blind rage the husband runs back into the room and grabs a large trunk and tosses it over the balcony where it proceeds to fall on the man below killing him.  Right after the husband tosses the trunk over the balcony he dies from a heart attack from all the strain.\n\nIn Heaven, Peter greets new arrivals.  The husband walks up to him and tells him about the incident and begs Peter to show forgiveness and let him in.  Peter smiles at the man and tells him that if a person dies while having a really bad day then they are allowed immediate access to heaven.  The husband enters into the pearly gates behind him.\n\nNext in line the naked man steps up.  Peter laughs and asks what happened to him.  The man told Peter \"You won't believe this, I was practicing naked yoga on my balcony on the 9th floor of the apartments I live in when I slipped and fell off the edge.  Thankfully I grabbed the sixth floors balcony edge on the way down trying to save myself.  Suddenly a man in a furious rage came outside and threw me off his balcony.  If it wasn't for the bushes below I would have died for sure but again I was saved.  I guess the guy didn't like that so he threw a huge trunk at me and here I am.\"  Peter laughed and told him to go on in.\n\nA third man walked up to Peter and told him \"Man I was having a great day, started banging this really hot chick I met at the bar and then suddenly she tells me to hide in her trunk.  I panicked and did as she asked but next thing I know it felt as if I was falling and I woke up here.\"",

The men she met could not hold her interest, and even if they could they never called her back. Her therapist told her what she needed to here:\n\n\"Jill, you're just too damned smart,\" she told her. \"Men really do want an intelligent woman, if they're any good at all, but you intimidate them. Your brain works in a way that is incomprehensible to even very smart men. You need to find someone who is smart enough to keep up with you, though that won't be easy.\"\n\nSo Jill began her search, using ways that only smart people would know (I don't know either), and finally found someone she thought might be her intellectual equal (or close enough.) She contacted him and he agreed to go on a date with her (his name is immaterial, but it's Joshua), and they met at a nice, but not too expensive, restaurant in a good part of town.\n\nUnfortunately, as smart as Joshua was (and again, his name is immaterial so don't focus on that), he was a complete slob. His hair was a tangled mess, his clothes looked like he slept in them regularly, and he stank! Jill could have forgiven him many things, but that stench was just too much!\n\nAt her next session she told her therapist what happened. \"Look, I wasn't trying to be overly choosy,\" she assured her therapist (who's name is also immaterial.) (But it's Linda, if you must know.) \"I didn't care about his looks or how much money he made, but he stank! I couldn't get past that. And he's the only male I've found, after exhaustive research, who could even come close to me intellectually. I just don't know what to do!\" she wailed.\n\nLinda (the therapist) studied Jill thoughtfully, then finally sighed and put her notebook down. \"Jill, you have to promise me you won't tell anybody I told you this,\" she began. \"I know a brain surgeon who can make a few... tweaks here and there, and bring your intellect down to a level that won't be so intimidating. It would mean you won't be as smart as you are now, but you'll be able to meet someone.\"\n\nJill said she'd need some time to think about it, but the truth was she had already decided. She'd accomplished everything that she really needed to with her top-rate intellect, and now she just wanted to find some companionship. She told her therapist the next week that she wanted to talk to the surgeon.\n\nThe surgeon explained in detail the procedure (and Jill, being so smart, corrected a few errors in his plan) and they agreed on a date for the surgery. \"Just tell me this,\" Jill said before she was put under. \"Will I still be somewhat intelligent?\"\n\n\"Oh, of course,\" the surgeon reassured her. \"We're only going to dial it back, as it were, but a few notches. You'll still be smarter than the average person, just not so much so that you're miles above everyone else.\"\n\n\"Okay, that's perfect!\" Jill exclaimed as the mask was lowered over her mouth and nose.\n\nThe doctor had told her that the surgery would last several hours, but, as it goes with surgery, from Jill's perspective she was out hardly any time at all. Her first waking memory was of the doctor coming into her room, looking very concerned.\n\n\"Jill,\" he said. \"I made a terrible mistake during the surgery. I intended to decrease your intelligence by roughly 5 percent, 10 at the outside. Somehow I overshot my target, and I decreased your intelligent by about 93 percent. I'm so terribly sorry. Can you ever forgive me?\"\n\nJill looked at the doctor with a puzzled expression on her face. Finally, she spoke. \"You know what I'm going to do, Doctor? I'm going to build a WALL! A yuge wall! It's going to be the best wall, believe me!\"",

Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.\n\n\"You're in the afterlife!\" he tells the man, \"But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.\"\n\nAll of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.\n\nThe beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. \"That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.\"\n\nSo the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.\n\n\"What are the odds?\" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. \"That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line.\" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.\n\nWhile he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, \"The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!\"\n\nSadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.\n\nAnd wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. \"Come,\" the beggar told him, \"I'll take you to the evening meal.\" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. \"That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,\" and then he added, \"and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!\"\n\nThe man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. \"What is it,\" he thought, \"that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?\" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.\n\nFifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.\n\nThe beggar laughed jovially. \"I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!\" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.\n\nSmiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. \"That's the line for the dragon meat,\" he said before turning to the next line, \"and that's the line for angeldust stew,\" then he paused, confused.\n\n\"What is it?\" the man asked his old friend.\n\nThe beggar replied, \"There appears to be no punchline.\"",

For this, I'll give you twenty years.\"\n\nBut the human said, \"Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?\"\n\n\"Okay,\" said God. \"You asked for it.\"\n\nSo that is why for our first twenty years, we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves. For the next forty years, we slave in the sun to support our family. For the next ten years, we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren. And for the last ten years, we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.\n\nLife has now been explained to you.",

But let's be honest, when it came to the vote or the right to work, women had a point.\n\nDoesn't mean men don't face stereotyping either though. Just last Wednesday afternoon I took my little boy to the park. And wouldn't you know it, every woman there gave me the weirdest stare. Like I was some pervert criminal kidnapping my own son.\n\nSo I plop the kid in a swing. Pull him way back - because he likes it fast - and give a good push. Thwap! Thwap! Thwap! it spins around up and over the poll - kid holding on for dear life. Swing seat creeping upward as the chain wraps around. Until, bang! Kid hits his head. \n\nHey, it's a life lesson!\n\nBut there's blood. And a crying baby. And every goddamn mother's eyes in the park sear at me with this evil stare. A woman comes up and asks if I have a bandage. \n\nNo. What, I expect the kid to get hurt at a park? Isn't that the safest place in the world for a kid? So no, I don't have no bandage. But I realize there's a diaper. She agrees it's a good idea. So I start pulling the kid's pants down to get it. Hey, at least he hadn't taken a dump!\n\nWhoa! You'd think it was some kind of child assault. Women from all over the park come rushing at me like offensive linebackers. \n\nHoly shit, it's a fucking twat posse! Each of them dragging their kids behind. Which, fortunately, did kind of slow them down.\n\nSo I grab my kid, stuff him in the carriage, and book the fuck out of there. This linebacker posse of female rage dragging their snot nosed kids at the hand, trailing behind. But I've got wheels so I'm faster. \n\nI get a good fifty yards ahead and turn to see them falling behind. Their fists raised in revolutionary spirit. And I thumb my nose with a raspberry to tell them what I think of their bullshit double standards. I mean, here I am just trying to be a good father! And they got to ruin it all with their self-righteous politics. \n\nThen I turn around and there's a cop. And I think, thank God! Someone to stop this mob. Officer, I say, help! I point at the women, 'they're chasing me!' But see all of them hit the ground to take cover.\n\nOh fuck. \n\n\"Raise your arms or I'll shoot!\"\n\n\"But I'm holding a baby carriage!\" \n\nBANG! \n\nNo problem, my arms go up. But then the baby carriage starts wheeling away down a hill toward a heavily trafficked intersection. I'm frantically pointing at it with my arms above my head. \n\n\"GET ON THE GROUND AND SURRENDER!\"\n\n\"But my baby!\"\n\nBANG!\n\nAt this point the carriage is actually speeding, illegally careening down the street, as the officer protects and serves my wrists into handcuffs. The women are standing there with wicked grins, triumphant in fully ejecting from their turf this masculine invader. \n\nThe baby rushes toward the intersection and is almost there when a construction worker runs out to catch him. By this point there are sirens everywhere, blue and red lights flashing, and a helicopter hovering overhead. \n\nThen a news truck arrives and a guy stands in front of a camera telling the world how a baby was just saved in the park from a kidnapping molester.\n\nIf it weren't for my wife, who arrived just in time to explain, I'd have been shimmed in a holding cell by Bubba the felon of extrajudicial justice. \n\nI've learned my lesson. Men don't take kids to the park alone. Next time I'll just go walk my fucking shaggy dog!",

        "body": "When I worked for a design agency, I had two adamant higher-ups. There was a brand identity project for a new company, and I was in charge of typography, but those two disagreed with my choice of font.\n\nThe first one was this stony-looking Peruvian-American man named Esteban Ferrero, but since that's Spanish for Steven Smith, and our company had a rule that everyone has to call each other using nicknames instead of last names, everyone, including himself, just called him Steve. The second one was a Dutch woman with a sharp glare named Evelien van der Berg. She was famous for giving designers a hard time convincing her that their design choices work better than hers. In accordance with the company rules, we called her Eve.\n\nAnyway, I showed Steve my first draft, and he wasn't convinced that I chose LinoLetter as the main font, and told me that I should use a sans-serif font. But I stood by my position that serifs add legibility to printed and digital material, that it fits the company's identity as an organic store, and that it is hard to stand out with a sans-serif. It took a lot of debate, but in the end, Steve was convinced that LinoLetter was acceptable.\n\nA few days later, I showed Eve a more elaborated version, as for the sizes and styles of the font, and the pairing of LinoLetter with Century as the headline font. She insisted that I should have used a sans-serif font for the headline. I expressed my view that LinoLetter is a font with composed and legible shape, and Century, while it is also legible, has flair at larger sizes. She kept disagreeing with me, saying I should use something bolder and more contrasting, like Tungsten. It felt like hours had passed before the conversation went anywhere, so I had to give up and look for a sans-serif font that goes with LinoLetter.\n\nSo it goes to show that the one who gave me a hard time was adamant Eve, not adamant Steve.",

As I burst through the doors of Bunnings and out into the parking lot, I came to a terrifying conclusion. Her theory was right. The parking lot was empty, no ute\nI immediately call the police. I gave them my location, confessed that I had left my keys in the ute, and that it had been stolen. Then I made the most difficult call of all.\n\"Honey,\" I stammered. I always call her honey in times like these. \"I left my keys in the ute, and it has been stolen.\"\nThere was a period of silence. I thought the call had been dropped, but then I heard Faye's voice.\n\"Kris,\" she barked, \"I dropped you off at Bunnings on my way to the grocery store!\"\nNow it was my time to be silent.

Nevertheless, Joe and I got along really well.\n\nOne day, he approached me and asked if he could move in with me and my girlfriend. He told us about how our job wasn't paying enough for him to live alone, so we agreed and he moved in a few days later.\n\nHe was an alright roommate. He always cleaned up after himself, he never made the apartment smell, and he was always on time when rent was due. The only thing that made me nervous about him was the way he looked at my girlfriend with a face of lust on his face. I eventually asked my girlfriend is she had noticed him doing this. She timidly declined noticing.\n\nSeveral months pass, and I receive some wonderful news; my girlfriend is pregnant! With Joe living in our apartment, I had been able to save more money in the bank, so after receiving the news, I immediately went out and bought a set of wedding rings and brought my girlfriend out to a fancy restaurant that night. It was there that I proposed to her. The moment I did, however, she began to tear up and say that she couldn't marry me. I asked her why. She told me that the baby wasn't mine, it was Joe's.\n\nFilled with rage, I immediately drove home and confronted Joe about what he had done. He tried telling me to calm down, but in my rage, I threw a punch that hit him right in the eye. He screamed in pain and ran into his room. By the time he emerged an hour later, he had packed his suitcase full of all of his things. His eye had swollen up and looked like a ball of cotton. He left that night, and as quick as he had entered my life, he was gone.\n\nIf it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe, I'd been married a long time ago. Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?\n\n*I found this beauty on a 4chan greentext a few months ago, but I have no idea who wrote it.*",

Finally, he comes up with an answer. These two love the heat because they have been cold all their lives.

He finds them back in their parkas, mittens and hats. They are jumping up and down and cheering.\nThe devil was dumbfounded. \"I don't understand. When I turn the heat up, you're happy.

I\u2019m not sure the IRS finds that believable.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m a great gambler, and I can prove it,\u2019 says Grandpa. \u2018How about a demonstration?\u2019\nThe auditor thinks for a moment and says, \u2018Okay.

The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa\u2019s attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.\n\u2018Want to go double or nothing?\u2019 Grandpa asks \u2018I\u2019ll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.\u2019\nThe auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there\u2019s no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.\nGrandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can\u2019t make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the auditor\u2019s desk.\nThe auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win.\nBut Grandpa\u2019s own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.\n\u2018Are you okay?\u2019 the auditor asks.\n\u2018Not really,\u2019 says the attorney. \u2018This morning, when Grandpa told me he\u2019d been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you\u2019d be happy about it.\u2019",

I've never ever been interested in boys or having a relationship with one. I have many guy friends, but I've never been sexually attracted to any of them in any sense of the word, or any male really.\n\n I've always been attracted to women. I'd walk down the street, I'd see a woman, and I'd in my head imagine being with her for a night. I'm really shy about it, and I never talk about sexuality in open, except with my partner, since I'm really, really shy about it. But I am a very sexual person towards women, I think about almost every woman I come in contact with who is moderately attractive. I was in a relationship with a girl for the past 5 years. I really loved her, I thought we were going to be together forever, I really did. Over the past year things started to get bumpy, and she really began changing.\n\n\nHer personality changed and she wasn't the girl I fell in love with. She was sometimes becoming really violent and abusive, and the next day would be very meek and apologetic, and then would go back to being angry. I couldn't deal with her anymore, it reached a certain point where I felt... I just didn't care for her anymore as a person. This was going on for a year so when we decided to break up, it was so clear this was what had to happen. She wanted to still 'stay friends'. I was struggling to hold back the tears, but many came through.\n\n\n I refused, I said no, it was over, no friends, no nothing, we're through. She got angry, said some really nasty things, I got scared a little, but then it was over. I was just left with my tears. The next few days were terrible, I would spend a lot of the time crying. And this is when it happened. I have one friend, he's really close, he's probably one of my best friends. He's a straight guy, but he's also 22, so he's much younger than me. He knows I'm lesbian and has always been there for me, we've known each other for maybe 2 years, 2 and a half years. We haven't known each other that long, but our friendship flourished from the get-go. \n\n\nThere was never any romantic tension or sexual sparks between us, he knew I was strictly into women and respected that. We were together at my home, we were talking. When I say we, it was mostly me. I was just going on and on about her, and what she meant to me, and how she hurt me. He kept reassuring me that I did the right decision because she was becoming borderline abusive, but I had convinced myself that I still loved her. He was telling me I shouldn't do this to myself, and I deserve much better. I was the one who initiated it, it was all me. I don't know what came over me. \n\n\nHe was sitting on the couch, and I pressed forward with him, trying to come on to him, trying to kiss him. He was at first resistant and was unsure of what I was doing, he said \"what are you doing\" \"are you sure, you want this.\" I told him \"please, this is what I want\", and then he went with it too. I then led him up to the bedroom in my house, things started getting heated and suddenly he asked for some money! I quickly looked again and realized he was an extinct reptile from the Mesozoic era and I was like \"Damnit Loch Ness monster! I ain't givin you no treefiddy!\"",

Only as she reached around in her little white cupboards she realised she had no sugar for her little white cake. \n\nNot to be disheartened she decided to wander next door to her neighbour, the little green man, to see if he would be kind enough to lend her some of his.  So she closed her little white cupboards, grabbed her little white coat and went through her little white door, locking it behind her, walked down her little white stars to her little white path and out past her little white letterbox turning left to see the little green man.\n\nThe little green man was up a little green ladder painting his little green house the most amazing shade of green you have ever seen.\n\"Mr. Green\" she shouted, \"Do you have a cup of sugar i can borrow?\" The little green man could not here her so he paced down his little green ladder and put down his little green bucket of paint and little green paintbrush and said \"sorry? could you repeat that?\"\n\n\"do you have a little cup of sugar i might borrow\" \n\n\"I am sorry Ms. White but I am afraid not, i lent my sugar to Mr. Red as he is making his own beer, however he may have some left\"\n\n\"Ah thank you Mr. Green\" she said, and wandered back down his little green path, out his little white gate, noticing for the first time Mr. green did not have a little green letterbox, rather a little green slit in his little green door. (This point will be important later).\n\nout she went walking back past her little white house and towards the traffic lights. Pressing the little silver button and waiting for the red crossing man to turn green before she crossed. As she waited she began thinking about how her day of easy baking a little white cake had turned into such as disaster, and the sun was beginning to heat up considerably. \n\nThe crossing signal turned green and so she wandered towards the little red man's house. Passing his little red letterbox, down his little red path and towards his little red door. The Little white woman knocked three times and waited for the little red man to open the door. but he did not. \n\nSo she knocked again, louder this time. perhaps he was filling his little red bottles with beer. But still no reply. She tries the little red door handle. The little red door opens. she walks into his little red living room, and shouts \"Mr Red, Are you hoooome?\" \n\n\"ill be down in a minute, I was just showering\" \n\n\"not a problem\" she calls back up stairs \n\nThe little red man emerges soon with a little red towel wrapped around his waist, little red chest hairs visible around his nipples. \n\n\"I was wondering if i might borrow a cup of sugar for my little white cake\"\n\n\"ah no problem at all\" said the little red man \"you know i had to borrow some off The little  green man across the road.\"\n\n\"yes he did mention it\" \n\nThe little red man got a little red chair from his little red dining room and placed it in the kitchen next to the little red bench, then stepped onto the chair to reach his quite high little red cupboards. \n\n\"can you please pass me a little red cup\" he asked as he opened the cupboards. the little white woman did so and as he turned to recieve the cup his towel fell clean off and onto the floor. \n\nThe little white woman was shocked! never had she been so humiliated and abashed in her life and so without another word turned on the spot and half marched half ran out of his little red house, down his little red path and across the road towards her little white house.\n\nWhere she was promptly hit by a Big yellow truck. \n\nBy the time the Paramedics arrived in there little blue van it was too late, the little white woman was dead. Which just goes to show, that you should never cross while the red man is flashing. \n\n",

Actually I want to thank you. You see, I'm a genie, and I've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years. Now that you've released me, I'm allowed to grant three wishes. I'll give you each one wish, and I'll keep the last one for myself.\"\n\n\"Wow, that's great!\" the husband said.

What do you think?\"\n\nShe mulled it over for a few moments and said, \"You know, you're right. Considering all that, I guess I wouldn't mind.\"\n\nThe genie and the woman went upstairs where he ravished her for the rest of the afternoon.

Tears run down his face and his eyes burn, but he refuses to make a face.\n\nThrough a whiskey-addled haze the man realizes he has completed the first part of the challenge.

When he reached the street, a crowd had gathered around the fallen figure, drawn by the beautiful music they had heard only moments before. As they silently parted to let the bishop through, one of them asked, \"Bishop, who was this man?\"\n\n\"I don't know his name,\" the bishop sadly replied, \"but his face rings a bell.\"\n\nThe following day, despite the sadness that weighed heavily on his heart due to the unfortunate death of the armless campanologist, the bishop continued his interviews for the bellringer of Notre Dame.\n\nThe first man to approach him said, \"Your excellency, I am the brother of the poor, armless wretch that fell to his death from this very belfry yesterday. I pray that you honor his life by allowing me to replace him in this duty.\"\n\nThe bishop agreed to give the man an audition, and as the armless man's brother stooped to pick up a mallet to strike the first bell, he groaned, clutched at his chest and died on the spot.\n\nTwo monks, hearing the bishop's cries of grief at this second tragedy,rushed up the stairs to his side.\n\n\"What has happened?\" the first breathlessly asked, \"Who is this man?\" \"I don't know his name,\" sighed the distraught bishop, \"but he's a dead ringer for his brother.",

One day, after a particularly heavy snowfall \u2013 more than 30 inches! \u2013 Greg turns to Edna while they\u2019re clearing their driveway and proclaims to his wife \u201cEdna, I\u2019ve had enough of this snow. We\u2019ve shoveled and scraped and salted and blowed for 50 years. We\u2019re going south, and we\u2019re not stopping until we find a place where no one knows what this damn thing is\u201d as he gestures at his snow blower. So the next day they pack their clothes and valuables, and Edna helps Greg strap the snow blower to the roof of their car, and they begin driving south.\n\nEventually, after many, many hours of driving, the pair reaches Vancouver, British Columbia. It\u2019s sunny and bright, with a warm breeze blowing in off the Pacific Ocean. It seems like a lovely place. As they pull into a gas station to refill their car Edna asks \u201cIs this where we\u2019re going to live?\u201d\n\nBut before Greg can answer, a man walks up to Greg\u2019s open window.\n\u201cHey there\u201d the man says \u201cthat\u2019s a nice snow blower you got there. Is it for sale or something?\u201d\n\nGreg turns to Edna and shakes his head \u201cNo honey, this isn\u2019t the place.\u201d\n\nSo the pair starts driving again. Their next pit stop is in Medford, Oregon. The relatively small city is nice and warm, and it\u2019s known for being sunnier and drier than other parts of the Pacific North-West.\n\n\u201cThis seems like a lovely spot\u201d Edna says. \u201cIs this where we\u2019re going to live?\u201d\n\nBut Greg shakes his head and points to the display of anti-freeze and windshield scrapers just inside the gas station\u2019s doors. \u201cThey still have winters here. I\u2019m afraid this isn\u2019t the spot.\u201d\n\nThey continue driving for what seems like an eternity, passing through San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, and many other towns and cities along the way, until eventually they reach Kingsville, Texas. Exhausted from their long journey, Greg and Edna pull into a small gas station to fuel up. The attendant comes out and, in a thick southern drawl, says \u201cWell howdy folks. Say, what\u2019s that contraption on top of your car, some kind of wheat thresher?\u201d\n\nEdna looks to Greg with a glimmer of hope in her eyes, and Greg smiles and nods back to her. \u201cThis is the place.\u201d\n\nSeveral months pass and Greg\u2019s brothers Will and Pete decide to pay him a surprise visit and get out of the Alaskan cold for a few weeks. So they hop on an airplane and go to Greg and Edna\u2019s address in Kingsville. As their cab pulls up to the house, they notice the place looks dark and unkempt. Unsure of what to do, they decided to knock on the neighbor\u2019s door and see what they know. When the neighbor answered, Will greeted him.\n\n\u201cUh, hey there. This is 114 East Shelton, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sure is\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh. Well you see, I thought my brother and his wife lived next door to you. But the house seems abandoned.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you must be talking about Greg and Edna\u201d the neighbor replies. \u201cThey moved out all flustered and in a hurry a few weeks ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Pete asks, somewhat alarmed. \u201cAre they okay? Were they in some kind of trouble?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. All I know is, last I saw of them, they we\u2019re driving North as fast as they could with a nigger strapped to the roof of their car.\u201d\n\n\n\n*My apologies if this breaks the rules on racism.

Where did you get this money?\"\n\nThe old lady replied, \"I make bets.\"\n\nThe president then asked, \"Bets?

He thoroughly checked them out until he was sure there was absolutely no way his balls were square and that he would win the bet.\nThe next morning, at precisely 10:00 am, the little old lady appeared with her lawyer at the president's office. She introduced the lawyer to the president and repeated the bet: \"$25,000 says the president's balls are square!\"\n\nThe president agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his pants so they could all see.\n\nThe president did.\n\nThe little old lady peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel them.\n\n\"Well, Okay,\" said the president, \"$25,000 is a lot of money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure.\"\n\nJust then, he noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the wall.\n\nThe President asked the old lady, \"What the hell's the matter with your lawyer?\"\n\nShe replied, \"Nothing, except I bet him $100,000 that at 10:00 a.m. today, I'd have The Bank of Canada's president's balls in my hand.\"",

After class is over and the students clear out, Johnny makes his guess. \"Blue.\" \n\n\"Nope.

Whenever christmas came around, he would always wish for tractor toys, miniatures, and pretty much anything that was related to tractors, and during birthdays he would get tractor shaped cakes. His life was full of tractors, and he couldn't get enough of them. \n\nWhen the boy was around the age of 15 he started getting really interested in girls. There was this cute girl at school that he liked,  but he didn't have the courage to ask her out. He went home to his dad and told him he needed to stop being so obsessed with tractors, because no girl would ever like him if all he cared about was tractors. The dad decided to take the boy to therapy. It took a long time with multiple visits, but eventually the boy managed to get rid of his obsession with tractors. The boy decided that he wanted to ask the cute girl from school out on a date. He built up all the courage he could, and asked her out. She said yes! The boy was very happy, and later the same day he had already reserved a table at a restaurant for them to eat at. \n\nThe big day was here. The boy and girl were sitting at their table at a nice restaurant, waiting for their food. The boy was really happy, but the girl seemed a bit upset. \n\n\"What's wrong?\" the boy asked.   \n\"Nothing much, I love this place but it's a bit smoky in here\" she replied\n\nThe boy stood up, emptied his lungs, and cleared the room of smoke in one breath. \n\nThe girl was amazed. \"Wow, how did you do that?\", she asked.   \nThe boy replied:\n\n\"I am an extractor fan\"",

He says to the usher, \"I'm the Pope, I don't need to be judged.\" The usher just shakes his head and pushes the Pope forwards towards the back of the line. \n\nThe Pope looks ahead and sees that the line is very long. There are about 70 people lining up and each person takes roughly 10 mins before they are let free. Thinking he's going to be waiting for a number of hours, he has a bright idea and walks up to the front of the queue. \n\nNot wanting to be too greedy he speaks to the person third in line from the front. He says, \"I'm the Pope, let me stand in front of you.\" The man replies with, \"Sorry I'm a Christian, I don't recognise the authority of the Pope.\" \n\nNot giving up hope the Pope goes and asks the same question to the second person in line. The man is from a lost tribe deep within the Amazon forests. The tribesman replies with, \"What's a Pope?\" \n\nStill not giving up, the Pope goes to the man at the front of the line. Thankfully, the man is a staunch Catholic and gladly lets the Pope stand in front of him.\n\nA few minutes later the Pope is called up to the front. A man speaking on behalf of God says \"You are about to be judged for the sins you have committed from being born up until you stepped forward towards me.\" \"We use a points system, accumulate less than a certain number of points and you will go to heaven.\" \"Accumulate too many points and you will go to hell for eternity.\" The Pope thinks to himself 'I'm the Pope, of course I'm going to heaven.' The man speaks again, saying, \"The verdict is.... Unfortunately, you are going to hell.\" The Pope retorts with \"No, no, there must be a mistake. I'm the Pope, if anything I should be the first person to go to heaven.\" The man shakes his head apologetically and says \"I'm sorry but you exceeded the number of points by 1. If you had committed one less sin you would have gone to heaven.\" Continuing, the man says, \"I'll read out some of the sins you committed. One was not greeting an archbishop when he opened a door for you. Another, ordering the Vatican toilet block to be out of bounds while you did your business there in peace. A third, excommunicating a priest when he took your parking space.\" \n\nThe Pope then asks, \"Well what was the last sin I committed to get me that one extra point?\"\nThe man replies with, \"Cutting in to the front of this queue.\"\n\nCame up with this as I was lying in bed sick.

Can you tell me about it?\"\n\nThe bartender shook his head. \"I can't, but my cousin lives in Darwin. Here's his address. The bartender handed him a business card. The danceologist thanked him, and booked a flight there. When he arrived at the airport, the cousin greeted the danceologist, and took him home.\n\n\"Every year on the 12^th of May they do the dance. You see that mountain up there? They live on top. They'll be doing it in 2 weeks.\n\nThe danceologist looked at the mountain in awe. Two weeks later, there was a heavy storm. There were collapsing, jagged rocks, and the icy winds battered him. He didn't bring any oxygen, and so he felt too out of breath, and took a rest. Later, he carried on for one last push, and reached the top, where he met the tribe.\n\n\"Aha! Is this where the Yapucha dance is?\", exclaimed the danceologist.\n\n\"Sorry\", said the chief. \"You missed it by twelve minutes\".\n\n\"WHAT?!\", exclaimed the man. \"Can you do it just for me?\", he asked.\n\n\"Sorry again\", said the chief. \"It would upset the Gods. Come back next year at 12 o' clock\"\n\nDistraught, he went down the mountain. He flew back to London, and waited a full year, holding off any other projects so he could practise, even to the point where he spent less time with his family. When the time came, he flew back to Darwin, climbed out the mountain, combatted the chilly winds, fought off aggressive wildlife, only to get hit by a rock on the head. Despite this, he carried on, and reached the top.\n\n\"Am I in time?!\", the danceologist panicked.\n\n\"Just in time!\", laughed the chief. \"Are we all ready?\"\n\nThe other tribesmen got into a circle and nodded.

He's well worth the money. \"\n\nWith his interest peaked, the customer then looked around and spotted a monkey in another cage with a $10,000 price tag. \"That one's even more expensive! What can it do?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, that one is a Maintenance Supervisor Monkey. He can instruct at all levels of aircraft maintenance, supervise all corrective and preventive maintenance programs, supervise a crew of maintainers, and even do most of the paperwork. A very useful monkey indeed,\" replied the shopkeeper.\n\nThe customer continued to look around the shop a little longer and found a third monkey in a cage.

I stopped my car and looked down the road to see a pig laying on its side. I checked my car and didn't see any real damage. I looked around and saw no street or farm signs or anything of the like. The pig then tried to get up but fell down again. He looked at me with a \"help me\" look in his face but I was no vet and wasn't planning on throwing him in the back of the car. He looked rattled but seemed to have no serious injury to him (no blood, head was intact, no missing limbs, etc), so I decided to get out of there. \n\nThe next day we get a knock at the door and my wife answers the door. She yells to me, \"babe the cops are here for you...\"  \nI go to the door and one of the cops says, \"hello sir I'm officer White and this is officer Smith, we would like to ask you a couple questions.\"\n\"Okay, how can I help you officers?\"\n\"Well, you can start by telling me where you were last night\"\n\"I went to my buddies house out by the ranches to play some cards and came home\" I said.\n\"Okay, do you drive a white Honda Civic with license plate ....\"\n\"Yes\" I said, \"what is this about\"\n\"Sorry sir but we have a report from a local farmer that you were involved in a felony hit and run with his pig. Unfortunately we are going to have to take you in\"\nI tried pleading my case by saying that there was no one around and that I looked for signs for someone to call but found none, but they didn't seem to care. They put the cuffs on me and I started to walk to their car. As I made the walk I looked at one of the officers, \"sir, I'm sorry but how did this even come about? Who told the farmer that I had hit the pig? I don't understand. It was in the middle of nowhere, no one was around and it was night out.\"\nI started to sit down in the back of the car and right before he closed the door he said, \"the pig squealed\"\n",

When I got to my apartment, I noticed that my wife was there, and loud moans were coming from the bedroom. I thought she might have a man in there so I ran and got my hammer, and couldn't help but start shouting that I was going to kill him. I get into the bedroom with my hammer, and sure enough there she is trying to throw on her clothes. I run out to the balcony, where I find the guy she was sleeping with, dangling off the balcony, probably trying to jump down to the apartment below us. Well I start bashing his fingers with my hammer until he lets go. We live on the 9th floor, but it looked like he didn't die because he landed on a bush. He was definitely injured though because he wasn't moving much. I was so furious that I needed to kill him. I looked around my apartment for something heavy to drop on him. I don't know where I got the strength from, but I lifted up my refrigerator and hoisted it over the balcony, where it fell 9 storied, and crushed him. I was so upset that I jumped over the balcony myself, and that's how I died.\"\n\nThe 2nd man goes \"well I live on the 11th floor of an apartment building. I was home, out on my balcony enjoying myself, when all of a sudden a huge gust of wind came and blew me off the balcony. I scrambled to grab on to anything and luckily I caught the balcony a few floors below me. As I was struggling to pull myself up, this madman came out with a hammer and started smashing my fingers in! I couldn't hold on and fell all the way to the ground. Luckily again, I landed on a bush and was dazed, but okay. Then I looked up and saw this huge box start to fall on me. It got bigger... and bigger...and SPLAT. It smashed me, and that's how I died.\"\n\nThe 3rd man goes, \"Well, I left work early to go back to my secretary's apartment, to have some fun. As things started heating up, I heard someone come into her apartment. She told me her husband is crazy and I'd better go hide.

Now, this bunny in particular was by himself because all of his pack had been devoured by hyenas and only he escaped. He had been also wandering around of days, and he couldn't think of anything but sex. \n\nSo, when the lion and the bunny met, they felt some sort of camaraderie and sat down to discuss their issues with women. \n\nAfter a while, the lion, who was horny as hell, told the bunny, \"you know, I'd appreciate if you... ah... helped me out. C'mon, be a pal, take one for the team.\"\n\nThe bunny thought about it and said \"ok, but you have to promise that then it'll be my turn.\"\n\nThe lion said \"oh, yeah, sure\" which was strange, because it's not like horny males would say anything to have sex. Besides, he though he would just eat the little motherfucker afterwards.\n\nSo, the lion had his way with the bunny. Needless to say, the experience was a gruesome ordeal for the little fellow.\n\nAfter he had finished giving all he had, the lion was too tired to do anything and lied down for a nap. The bunny, trying hard to recover, climbed on the back of the lion and tried to do his thing. However, it was such a little creature compared to the lion and there wasn't much he could do. The lion barely felt anything. Not that the bunny didn't give it his all, mind you, but he just was too small.\n\nMeanwhile, nearby on a tree, a couple of Capuchin monkeys were smoking pot. One of them told the other, \"man, I don't know where you got this shit, but it's too strong for me. I think I'm seeing a bunny fucking a lion.\"\n\nThe other monkey turned around and said \"dude, you're not seeing things, it's really what's happening.\" Both monkeys laughed their asses off, coz they were pretty stoned, and then they started to throw coconuts at the lion and the monkey, coz they were trolls and they were pretty stoned. \n\nOne of the coconuts hit the lion on the head, waking him up. \"Hey, that hurts\" complained the lion loudly.\n\nAnd the bunny went \"YEAH, IT'S PAYBACK TIME, BITCH!\"\n\n",

Also, the original person called in sick at the last moment, and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking for directions to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides, they told me that I could have free beer during the tasting. So I accepted.\n\nHere are the scorecards from the event:\n\nCHILI # 1: MIKE'S MANIC MONSTER CHILI\n\nJUDGE ONE: A little to heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.\n\nJUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.\n\nFRANK: Holy Shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway with this stuff. I needed two beers to put the flames out. Hope that's the worst one. Those Texans are crazy.\n\nCHILI # 2: ARTHUR'S AFTERBURNER CHILI\n\nJUDGE ONE: Smokey, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.\n\nJUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor. Needs more peppers to be taken seriously.\n\nFRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to walkie-talkie in three extra beers when they saw the look on my face.\n\nCHILI # 3: FRED'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI\n\nJUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.\n\nJUDGE TWO: A beanless chili. A bit salty. Good use of red peppers.\n\nFRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced.\n\nCHILI # 4: BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC\n\nJUDGE ONE: Black Bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.\n\nJUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods. Not much of a chili.\n\nFRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb bitch is starting to look HOT, just like this nuclear-waste I'm eating.\n\nCHILI # 5: LINDA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER\n\nJUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.\n\nJUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.\n\nFRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no linger focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly from a pitcher onto it. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Freakin' Rednecks! ! !\n\nCHILI # 6: VERA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY\n\nJUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice and peppers.\n\nJUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions and garlic.\n\nFRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulphuric flames. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone!\n\nCHILI # 7: SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI\n\nJUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.\n\nJUDGE TWO: Ho Hum. Tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should note that I am worried about Judge # 3.\n\nFRANK: You could put a FUCKING Grenade in my mouth, pull the FUCKING pin, and I wouldn't feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my FUCKING mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit, to match my FUCKING shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the four inch hole in my stomach.\n\nCHILI # 8: HELEN'S MOUNT SAINT CHILI\n\nJUDGE ONE: A perfect ending. This is a nice blend chili, safe for all; not too bold, but spicy enough to declare its existence.\n\nJUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good balanced chili, neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge # 3 passed out, fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Yank.\n\n(Editor's Note: Judge # 3 was unable to report).",

As he pulls into the farmyard, a large pig in the pen by the barn catches his eye. He wanders over for a closer look and to his astonishment he sees that the pig has a wooden leg! As he is staring at the pig, the farmer emerges from the barn and extends a greeting.\r\nThe young salesman introduces himself, but then curiosity gets a hold of him and he asks the farmer about the pig with the wooden leg. The farmer replies, \u201cWell young man, that is no ordinary pig. That\u2019s  a special pig.\u201d\r\n\u201cI can see that,\u201d said the young salesman, \u201cbut why does he have a wooden leg? \u201c\r\n\u201cWell let me tell you.\u201d Said the farmer. \u201cOne day I was plowing right there on the other side of that pig\u2019s pen when I stopped the tractor to move a big rock out of the way. Don\u2019t you know that tractor slipped into gear and would have run me over \u2018cept that pig broke through the fence and pushed me out of the way just in time.\u201d\r\n\u201cSo is that how the pig lost his leg?\u201d\r\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d said the farmer, \u201cI\u2019m trying to tell you that is one special pig. Why just a couple of months ago the wife and I were sound asleep about three in the morning when a fire broke out on the porch over there. That pig broke through the pen, rushed to the house and made such a ruckus we were woken up in time to put out the fire. He saved our lives!\u201d\r\n\u201cSo did he lose his leg in the fire?\u201d Asked the young man.\r\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d said the farmer. \u201cI\u2019m trying to tell you. That\u2019s one special pig! Why just four weeks ago I was home alone. I had a heart attack. That pig ran into the road and right in front of the first car that came by. When the driver got out the pig led the man to me lying in the barnyard. The driver called an ambulance. That pig saved my life!\u201d\r\nAlight, alright, I get it. That\u2019s one special pig, but why does he have a wooden leg?\u201d\r\n\u201cMister, \u201c the farmer said,  \u201ca pig like that you don\u2019t eat all at once.\u201d",

Swimming just below the fly was a fish,who thought to him self, 'If that fly drops down a little, I'll be able to jump up and eat him.'\n\nBeyond the river, on the bank, a bear sat, watching the fly and the fish and pondering, 'Man, if that fly drops and the fish catches it, I'll have enough time to run into the river and get that fish.'\n\nBehind the bear, a hunter was hidden, waiting,' If that fly drops, the fish catches the fly and the bear gets the fish, it'll be a perfect time to shoot that bear.'\n\nWell, in the hills, not too far away from the hunter, a wildcat stocked about, watching the scenario and thinking, 'If that fly drops and the fish jumps up to catch the fly and the bear runs to catch the fish, then the hunter fires his weapon, I know something they don't know.  The man has a bag of chips in his pocket and I'm going to have myself a snack!'\n\nSure enough, the fly dips down, the fish jumps up and eats the fly, the bear runs down and catches the fish and the hunter fires his gun and gets the bear, with the chips falling onto the ground.  Taking his opportunity, the wildcat sprints down the hill and closes in on the bag, but misses it and slips on a strip of mud, sliding straight into the river.\n\nWhat's the moral of this story?\n\nEvery time a fly drops, a pussy gets wet.\n\n",

He got in touch with the Pope and asked the pontiff whether he could change the words of the Lord's Prayer from \"Give us this day our daily bread\" to \"Give us this day our daily chicken.\" \"I can't possibly do that,\" said the Pope. \"Not even for 100,000 dollars?\" asked the Colonel. \"No, not for 100,000 dollars,\" replied the Pope. Six months on and KFC sales were declining still further. The Colonel was getting desperate and made another call to the Pope. This time he offered 500,000 dollars for the words of the Lord's Prayer to be changed to \"Give us this day our daily chicken.\" Again the Pope refused. \"I can't possibly change the wording of the Lord's Prayer from bread to chicken,\" he repeated. Another six months and KFC sales had reached an all-time low. The company was in danger of going out of business. Colonel Sanders made one last attempt to persuade the Pope to change the wording of the Lord's Prayer. ''I'll donate 50 million dollars to the Vatican if you change the word 'bread' to 'chicken' in the Lord's Prayer.\" \"That's a lot of money,\" conceded the Pope. \"So you'll do it?\" ''I'll have to discuss it with the cardinals.\" So the Pope called a meeting of the cardinals. He began: \"I have good news and bad news. The good news is, KFC are going to donate 50 million dollars to the Vatican. The bad news is, we lost the Wonder Bread account.\"",

With laboured breath, he leaned against the door-frame, gazing into the kitchen. Were it not for death's agony, he would have thought himself already in heaven: there, spread out upon waxed paper on the kitchen table were literally hundreds of his favourite chocolate chip cookies. Was it heaven? Or was it one final act of heroic love from his devoted wife, seeing to it that he left this world a happy man? Mustering one great final effort, he threw himself toward the table, landing on his knees in a rumpled posture. His parched lips parted: the wondrous taste of the cookie was already in his mouth, seemingly bringing him back to life. The aged and withered hand trembled on its way to a cookie at the edge of the table, when it was suddenly smacked with a spatula by his wife. \"Stay out of those,\" she said, \"they're for the funeral.\"\n",

The couple thinks this is a good idea to try but unfortunately Sam can't rise to the occasion.\n\n\nJohn however has a raging erection and not wanting to pass up potentially penetrating the beautiful Julie, he wearily suggests that he be the one to do it. Sam is hesitant but can see how much discomfort Julie is in, so he allows this.\n\nWith that, John honey's up his Penis and inserts it into Julies V. The bee however is having none of it, so John starts slowly going in deeper and deeper but the bee is still not budging. John says \"screw this\" and goes in as deep as he can and starts thrusting as hard as he can...\n\n\nWhilst Julie starts moaning with excitement, Sam loses it and yells at John asking him \"What the fuck do you think you're doing !!\"  - To which John replies \"There's been a change of plan mate................

They are British. They stay with titles, those are much more important.\r\n\r\nAaargh!  Okay, okay, tomorrow morning when the parliament starts, who is going to sit in that reserved chair?\r\n\r\nTheresa May.\r\n\r\nAha!  So you don't know for sure who!\r\n\r\nNo, I know for sure, Theresa May.\r\n\r\nOh, here we go again!  Okay, do they pay them in the British Parliament?\r\n\r\nOf course, each and every one of them.\r\n\r\nGood, so when the PM goes to collect the pay at the end of the month who gets the money?\r\n\r\nTheresa May.\r\n\r\nI'm not asking you who *may* pick up the money! I'm asking who *will* pick up the money?\r\n\r\nTheresa May.\r\n\r\nAaaargh! .....   (thinking) .....

Since he was so busy galavanting around the room making sure that nobody cheated and that everyone was aware of how much time they had left before their failure of the test was complete, he had the students stack the completed tests on the huge podium at the front of the room.  This made for quite a mess, remember there were 1000 \nstudents in the class.\n\nAnyway, during this particular final, one guy entered the test needing a decent grade to pass the class.  His only problem with Calculus was that he did poorly when rushed, and this ass standing in the front of the room barking out how much time was left before the tests had to be handed in didn't help him at all.

You've FAILED it and, consequently, I'll see you next term when you repeat my course.\"  \nThe student smiled slyly and asked the professor \"Do you know who I am?\"  \n\"What?\" replied the professor gruffly, annoyed that the student showed no sign of emotion.  \nThe student rephrased the question mockingly, \"Do you know what my name is?\"  \n\"NO\", snarled the professor.  \nThe student looked the professor dead in the eyes and said slowly, \"I didn't think so\", as he lifted up one of the stacks half way, shoved his test neatly into the center of the stack, let the stack fall burying his test in the middle, turned around and walked casually out of the huge lecture hall.",

He asks the bartender about the sign out front and the bartender guarantees that he would keep his word. Pondering for a second, the man asks if he can have a moment alone with the horse to which the bartender agrees. Two minutes later, the man comes back in and the bartender can hear his horse laughing his ass off. The bartender then asks the man what he did, but the man does not tell. Keeping his word the man got free food and free drinks all night.\n\nThe next day the man is strolling by the bar again when he sees the sign this time and it says \"If you can make my horse cry, free food and free drinks!\" So the man decides to walk back in. The bartender notices the guy from the night before and asked if he was here for the challenge. The man agreed and asked for another 2 minutes alone with the horse. When he returned to the bar, the bartender can hear his horse crying and wailing in agony. Puzzled, the bartender had to know how the man did it. So after offering up free food and drinks again, the bartender made sure the man stay around to find out how he did it. After getting the man drunk, the bartender asks, \"Man, you gotta tell me what you did to my horse.\" Drunkenly, the man says \"You really wanna know? Fine. Well you see the first night, I whispered in your horses ear that I had a bigger dick than he did. And as for the 2nd night, I came back and proved it.\"",

Every day, he was searched on his way into the camp, and then again when he left to be sure he wasn't helping the prisoners or stealing. As the workers came and left, the Overseer, a very suspicious man, would watch the man enter before dawn, and leave after nightfall with the soiled hay, well after most other workers went home. \n\nFor some reason, he started to have the sneaking suspicion that this man was stealing from his camp! As weeks went by, the Overseer became more and more suspicious. Finally he couldn't take it anymore, and ordered two guards to search the man more thoroughly as he left one night, instead of the usual one. Nothing was found.\n\nThe next night, the overseer had three guards search the man, AND dump out the straw from the wheelbarrow to go through it. Again, nothing, and the old man quietly put the soiled hay back into the wheelbarrow, and left.\n\nAs the weeks went by and the man was searched more and more rigorously, the overseer finally started personally searching the man as he came in in the morning, and left at night with a wheelbarrow of soiled hay. Eventually, he even went so far as to have the man strip down each night, and had his guards dismantle the wheelbarrow, and search the straw with a magnifying glass! Still, nothing! \n\nThe overseer said to the man one night, \"I know you are stealing from my camp, and as God as my witness, I WILL find what you are stealing, and throw your sorry ass in with the prisoners!\". The man respectfully stated he was innocent, and allowed the guards to search him. \n\nThis went on for months. Eventually, the Allies overran the Nazis, and liberated the camp where the man worked. The overseer was thrown into prison by the allies to await trial for his crimes. \n\nOne day, he was visited by the old man. The overseer ranted and raved at the old man, demanding he told him what he had been stealing, as none of his men could ever find that the old man had been doing anything against the Reich. After the overseer finally ran out of breath, he asked the man one last time to tell him what he was stealing. \n\nThe old man grinned, and leaned close to the overseer.

It can walk, eat, sleep, read and so on, but for some reason the German child never speaks. The concerned parents take it to the doctor, who reassures them that as the German child is perfectly developed in all other areas, there is nothing to worry about and that he is sure the speech faculty will eventually blossom. Years pass. The German child enters its teens, and still it is not speaking, though in all other respects it is fully functional. The German child's mother is especially distressed by this, but attempts to conceal her sadness. One day she makes the German child, who is now 17 years old and still silent, a bowl of tomato soup, and takes it through to him in the parlour where he is listening to a wind-up gramophone record player. Soon, the German child appears in the kitchen and suddenly declares, \"Mother. This soup is a little tepid.\" The German child's mother is astonished. \"All these years,\" she exclaims, \"we assumed you could not speak. And yet all along it appears you could. Why? Why did you never say anything before?\" \"Because, mother,\" answers the German child, \"up until now, everything has been satisfactory.\"",

Bill pees in a cup, gives it to The Guru who proceeds to sip it. After a few The Guru informs Bill that he has tennis elbow... Soak the Elbow in hot water with assorted salts/minerals every night for 1 week and to lay off any activities that would further aggravate it, will fix it.\n\n\nBill is impressed but not convinced so he ends up going to the doctor, who informs him the very exact thing that The Guru informed him.\n\nBill is ecstatic over The Guru and rants and raves about The Guru to everyone. Bill comes up with an idea though to try and stump The Guru. After dinner one night, Bill gets his wife to urinate into a cup, along with his daughter and his dog. Bill also masturbates into the cup for good measure.\n\n\nThe following morning, Bill again goes to 10th and 3rd and hands The Guru the cup with the mixtures... The Guru sips from the cup and begins to somewhat spasm. Bill is just about to scream out \"HAHA I got you\" in joy when The Guru begins...\n\n\n\"Your wife is pregnant with twins, but they aren't yours - get a Lawyer... \n\nYour daughter has HIV and from the return, seems addicted to Crack - Take her to rehab...\n\nYour dog has a severe case of worms - take him to the vet\n\nAnd how do you expect your tennis elbow to heal, if you are masturbating!!\"",

However, during analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the ...bird's beaks and claws. By analysing these paint residues it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with motorbikes, while only 2% were killed by cars.\n\nThe Agency then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorbike kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger. They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout \"Cah\", not a single one could shout \"bike\"",

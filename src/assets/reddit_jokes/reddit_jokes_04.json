Whenever I finish the tale they're always pale as Lyndon B's corrupt lyin' ass.  I can't blame 'em.  This story kept me up throughout my whole deployment in those damn jungles.  Worse still, I was the \"protagonist\" of this story, if you can call me that.\n\nIt was October, 1972.  We were stationed along the Ho Chi Minh trail to intercept supplies going through a triage of enemy villages 112 kilometers north of the capital.  My platoon had set up an encampment on the southside hill in relation to these villages when gunfire began raining down on us.\n\nWe did what we were trained to do, although I could tell the rest of the boys were scared out of their minds.  I can't blame 'em.  But when the gunfire became sweeping towards our position from farther south was when we all realized we were in some deep shit.  We were rats snapped snug into a trap.\n\nWe called for reinforcements, but the higher ups all had their hands tied up in other ambushes throughout the valley.  Air support was limited, although we relished the brief pauses in the bloodshed it would give us when they dropped the bombs on the hostiles.\n\nDuring one of the enemy waves I lost four of my fingers to enemy grenade shrapnel.  A Norwegian recruit, Sven Alfoldssen, saved my ass during that same encounter.  The men began calling me \"Six\", and Alfoldssen \"Seven\".\n\nWe became pretty good friends.  We shared a few drinks together, spoke about our women, reminisced about times before we were drafted into this whole shit show.  But we were proud to serve, and would die for our respective countries willingly if it meant stopping the Commies from encroaching on our freedoms.\n\nBut that all changed after a few weeks of no reinforcements and dwindling supplies.  Some men began eating flour mixed with dirt to sate their unrelenting appetites.  There were some scuffles for the last few MREs that got pretty violent.  Before we had some hope help would arrive to push the commies off the hill to get us some goddamn food.  Now, it was no secret we were in some dire fucking straits.\n\nThree weeks passed since the last MRE was eaten.  If the Viet Cong made a significant offensive on our position during then, we would've certainly kissed all our lives goodbye.  The men found it hard just to stand up in the morning.  Our rip-cages were all showing, and we just started isolating ourselves from one another.  There's no point in making small talk if all you can think about is the next bite to eat.\n\nThis is where I'm struggling to recollect my thoughts.  It's not that I *can't* remember, mind you.  I don't *want* to remember.  Who on this fucking marble called planet Earth *wouldn't* want to forget this?\n\nSeven began talking to me for the first time in three days.  I didn't want to reciprocate, because I had to patrol the perimeter that day and he was obviously compromising my position with his banter.  He was saying some shit about one of our foreign recruits hailing from Germany.  Saying things like \"we should take him by surprise\" and \"he'd make for some nice company during dinner.\"  I mostly ignored what he said, but the little I retained sent chills up my spine.\n\nThat night, I went to see how the german was doing.  This was the worst mistake of my life, and what I saw would never leave my memories till the day I die.  I opened up the tent and saw Seven with a bloody fistful of the german over his mouth.  I saw the poor man moaning his dying breaths as Seven bit on his intestines.  I'll never forget what the german said.  *Nein ... Nein ...*.\n\nIn absolute rage, I grabbed a nearby rope and strangled the cannibal Seven to death.  I strangled to death a man who was once my friend.  When the deed was done, the german had already passed.  I cried, holding his bloodied head in my arms.  \n\nI couldn't find a dogtag on the german's body.  Seven must've thrown it away somewhere in some inane attempt to cover-up his crime.  The rest of my comrades, upon hearing about what happened, began calling the poor soul \"Nein\".\n\nReinforcements and supplies arrived a couple days afterwards.  After a few weeks in the hospital, we were sent back into the thick of it all.  War is like that.  It never forgets, but also never cares.\n\nI've told this story to so many naive greens during my time in these jungles.  This story kept me up through it all, and not in a good way.  I'll never forget what I saw that night.  When I saw how Sven ate Nein.\n\n(TL;DR: Because Seven Eight Nine)\n\n\n\n",

I came home one day to my apartment to see her lying naked in bed, and when I looked over to the balcony, I could see someone holding onto the railing. I asked them, 'What the Hell are you doing here?!\", but he wouldn't reply. I immediately knew that my wife was cheating with him on me. So while my wife was sleeping, I walked up to the man and started punching his hands, in order to make him fall off.\n\nBut he wouldn't let go.\n\nSo I went and grabbed a knife from the kitchen and started cutting off his fingers. He let go of the railing and fell down about twenty five storeys before hitting the ground.\n\nHe was still alive.\n\nStill angry, I went to the kitchen once more and dragged a refrigerator towards the balcony. I then threw the refrigerator over the railing, but my hand must have been caught in the handle of the refrigerator, and so I fell as well. And that's how I died.\"\n\nGod frowned and said, \"Well, I guess that's a pretty terrible way to die. I'll let you in.\". He opened the gates and let the man in, before closing them off once more.\nSoon afterwards, he was greeted by a second man.\n\n\"How did you die?\", God asked. He then realised that the man was deaf, and started moving his hands, communicating in sign language.\n\nThe man replied by moving his hands as well, , \"Well, I was doing exercises out on the balcony of my apartment, when suddenly, I slipped and fell. I was lucky enough to grab onto the railing on the floor below mine, and hung on. Suddenly, a man appeared in front of me. He yelled something at me, but I couldn't understand him because I am deaf. Without warning, he quickly began hitting my hands, but I still managed to hang on. He then quickly left and came back again, and then began cutting my fingers off! I couldn't hold on anymore, and let go. I miraculously managed to survive the fall, but I could not move, as I was now paralyzed. A minute later, the man threw a refrigerator and himself off the building, killing me in the process.\"\n\nGod cringed as he finished listening and moved his hands around, saying \"Jesus Christ, just go through the gate!\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" The gate opened once more, and closed as the deaf man walked through.\n\nHalf an hour later, a third man appeared at the gate, and once more, God asked, \"How did you die?\"\n\nThe man replied, \"Well you see, I was hiding naked inside a refrigerator and . . .\"",

But anyways, as a teacher, let me tell you a little story...\n\nI had a female student (I'm a male), who was rather attractive. Not gonna lie. But I would never pursue a student sexually or romantically. Apparently, that feeling was not mutual. At first, things were like they usually were with stupid young girl crushing: double entendres, very subtle comments, etc. But there's a line, and she crossed it.\n\nShe wrote her number on an essay with a smiley face. This was not okay by any means. I immediately contacted an administrator so I wouldn't get in any trouble. These sorts of things are taken very seriously at pretty much any grade level these days, and I'm not interested in losing my job over some girl's hormones getting the best of her.\n\nSo a couple of days later, this administrator called a meeting with the parents. We were all in the office and the administrator was doing his spiel to the girl and her parents about appropriate behavior at school and appropriate age differences and the like (apparently this is a common enough issue that he had some training on how to have this kind of talk). She looked fairly ashamed, staring at the floor the whole time. He finished his rehearsed rant and then asked the parents if they had anything they wanted to say to the daughter. \n\nThe father was silent, but the mother spoke up. She said something about how the girl should know better and how they taught her better than this, etc. The usual parent reprimand stuff. But teenage girls can often find ways to surprise you. The mom asked her daughter, \"And what did you even expect would come of something like this?\" My student was quiet for a moment, looking down at the floor still, but then she turned to me, and I will never forget the way she looked at me when she said it: \"About tree fiddy.\" It was about this time I noticed that my student was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era. I said, \"Damn it, monsta, get out of this office! I ain't givin' you no damn tree fiddy!\"\n\nTL;DR Teenage girls are crazy",

She lived a typical grandmother life, knitting, spoiling her grandchildren and puttering around.\n\nBut despite having lived a full life before retiring, she wanted something more. So she decided to take her love of gin and turn it into a hobby. Erica painstakingly researched different recipes for gin, mixed them with her cooking expertise, and experimented for months with different ratios, strainers and ingredients.\n\nAfter many months of working on her various gins, one of her friends, Stacy, came over to her house one night and happened to try one of the drinks. Stacy found it so delicious that she suggested that Erica should try selling some of her various flavors of gin. Erica did just that, starting at the local farmer's market, and when her popularity increased, she began mass producing her most-loved flavors of gin.\n\nErica's gin quickly became hailed as one of the best-grade gins in the world, earning awards and feature articles in popular publications.\n\nIt wouldn't last though. Erica's life was tragically cut short by a heart attack, and with her death came the death of her secret recipes. Many people would try to recreate Erica's gin for years to come, yet no one could find the proper mixtures of ingredients.\n\nBut Stacy, the one who pushed her to start her business, never gave up. She searched and searched, looking through purchase logs and transactions for the suppliers of Erica's juniper berries, malt, and other ingredients. Stacy worked nights and weekends for months on end, ardently refining her product, until, amazingly, she came across the perfect recipe. Erica's original gin recipe. It tasted exactly like the first gin Erica had made that fateful night years before. Stacy brought the original Erica brand of gin back to the world, and gin-lovers the world over rejoiced at her work.\n\nThe moral of this story is thus: With hard work and perseverance, you too can Make An erica Grade-A gin.",

Do you think I could stay the night?\"\n\nThe monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.\n\nThe next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.\n\nYears later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.\n\nThe monks reply, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\"\nThe man says, \"If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.\"\n\nThe monks reply, \"You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.\"\n\nThe man sets about his task. \n\nAfter years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.\n\n\"In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.\"\n\nThe monks reply, \"Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.\"\n\nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \"The sound is beyond that door.\"\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.\n\nFinally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, \"This is the last key to the last door.\"\n\nBut of course I can't tell you what's behind the door because you're not a monk",

Hugh allowed the friars of the church to set up a cart in his mall to sell their flowers. Every day, the friars came in at 7:00 in the morning with a bushel of beautiful flowers and began to work diligently to arrange them into bouquets. All was going well, the mall was generating more revenue and the church was making more money than they were by selling the flowers in front of the church on Sunday. Everyone was happy; until that first weekend.\n\nOur town is kinda tourist-y, so we get some out-of-towners on the weekends. A gay couple came to the mall the first weekend that the friars had taken up shop (Typically, our town is pretty progressive, but the friars tended to be uber-conservative). The couple came over to the cart and admired the flowers; they tried to purchase a bouquet, but the friars refused to sell to them. The couple was outraged and went to see Hugh directly. They complained to him that the friars were being discriminatory, so Hugh promised to have a talk with the friars. When Hugh confronted the friars, they refused to sell to the couple on the grounds that \u201cthey were committing an atrocity in the eyes of the lord.\u201d The couple stormed off and promised to boycott the cart.\n\nThis past weekend, the couple came back with a large group and a letter from the mayor, saying that the friars had to sell to them, regardless of sexual preference. The friars stood firm and refused to sell to them, so the group started a protest. They brought in signs and started chanting around the cart. The friars continued to sell their flowers and Hugh allowed them to remain, so eventually the protest began to boycott the mall, rather than just the cart.\nBy today, the mall had lost 50% of its normal weekend revenue. The group sent a letter to Hugh saying that they could forgive him if he shut down the flower cart within the week. Hugh was pretty broken up, but he had no choice. To maintain his livelihood, he would have to kick the friars out of his store. He talked with the friars this morning and revoked their previous agreement. The friars had their cart packed and left by 7:30, to huge cheers from the community. The mall has been pretty normal today, and it seems like all has returned to normal, but Hugh has taken the day off to think about what he did. He was the only person who could have settled the disagreement between the community and the church, but he wished it didn\u2019t have to come to this.\n\nOnly Hugh can prevent florist friars.",

You all risked your life to save this man and I hope that news of this will travel around the world and set an example to others.

But one day, as he was presenting his wares at the Court, a frightful catastrophe occurred. When Abdul bowed low before Haroun al Rashid, he broke wind. That night, the carpet-maker closed his shop, piled his most precious wares upon a single camel, and left Baghdad. For years he wandered, changing his name but never his profession and always yearning to return to his beloved city of birth. He was an old man when he at last felt that everyone had forgotten his disgrace, and it was safe to return homeward again. It was night when he finally arrived at Baghdad, so he decided to rest at a convenient hostel before entering the city in the morning.  The Innkeeper was talkative and friendly, so Abdul was delighted to ply him of news and all that had occurred during his absence.  They were both laughing over court scandals when Abdul asked, \"When did this happen?\"  The Innkeeper paused in thought, then scratched his head. \"I'm not sure of the date,\" He said, \"But it was about 5 years after Abdul Hassan farted.\"\nSo the carpet-maker never did return to Baghdad.",

Just like normal -- you know, like everybody does\"\n\nThe doctor is astonished and then finally says,\n\n\"Well, Sven, I've got to tell you, I'm pretty sure it's all the sex with Olga that's wearing you down.

Their hopes of survival are shattered, as the chief of the tribe proclaims: \"We will kill you all in a terrible and painful way.\" They start to plead for their lifes and finally the chief gives in. He offers them a challenge: \"If you succed in our 3 holy tasks, we will let you live. First: Drink 2 litres of our strongest moonshine. Second: Go to the dark cave and kill the bloodthirsty bear living there. And third: Sneak into the camp of our rival tribe and rape their chieftains' daughter.\" Desperately the 3 men agree.\n\nThe American starts. He manages to drink half a litre of moonshines, then passes out, so they kill him. Second goes the German. Being an experienced drinker he manages to trink 1 1/2 litres of the evil stuff. Just as he goes for the rest he blacks out and dies of alcohol poisoning. Third goes the russian. After downing the 2 litre of moonshine in one gulp he asks for more. Having finished another litre he proceeds to waddle to the cave. The natives are mightyly impressed as he enters the cave fearlessly. After some time there are some terrible fighting noises to be heard. There are excruciating screams and moans, from man and bear alike. This goes on for some time. Suddenly there is a loud whimpering from the bear which slowly fades after some time. After that the russian is leaving the cave. His shirt is torn, his back full of bloody scratches, otherwise he seems okay. The natives and their chief watch him in awe. Finally he straightens his back, looks the chief directly in the eye and asks: \"Aaah, so, that would be that. Now where can I find this chieftains' daughter, I am supposed to kill?\"\n",

Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.\n\nThe next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her \"womanly\" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.\n\nBut the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.\n\nAnyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.\n",

It was on the 42nd floor of a high-rise building, he goes he sets down and orders a drink. After a few moments a man down on the other side of the bar notices him looking downtrodden and decides to go and see what the problem is. He asks him what is wrong and listens to his story intently. At the end of the story the man tells him \"well the reason I really like this bar is that it can really lift your spirits, the winds up here are so strong that if you jump out this window over here to the right, it'll actually fly around the entire building and land you right back in this window. It's such an exhilarating feeling that anything that has went wrong in your life just instantly feel better.\"  The downtrodden fellow replies \"YEAH RIGHT, that a load of bull if I've ever heard one but thanks for the laugh\" The cheery fellow tells him it's true and offers to demonstrate the phenomenon first hand to suppress any suspicion. The man agrees and they both approach the window.  The cheery man jumps out the window and sure enough a few moments later comes whizzing from the opposite side and lands perfectly back into the same window. The downtrodden fellow exclaims \"WOW THATS AMAZING!\" He promptly jumps out the window and plummets to his death....The cheery fellow returns to the bar and orders another drink and the bartender says \"you know Superman, you're a real asshole when you're drunk....\"",

I'm gonna get him!\" John sets down the binos and picks up his rifle. He looks through the scope into the valley but doesn't see the bear. \"Hmm. Thats strange.\" Just then he feels a tap on his shoulder. He lowers the rifle and looks behind him. He gasps in fear as he sees the bear standing over him. \"What do we have here?\" Says the bear. \"Looks like a free lunch.\"\n\n\"Oh please don't eat me says John. I will do anything.\"\n\n\"Well...\" The bear says, \"There is one thing. You have to let me fuck you in the ass. Then I will let you go.\"\n\n\"Um...ok.

Just then a tap on his shoulder startled him. He turns around in shock to see the bear there standing over him again. \n\n\"Back again I see.\" Says the bear. \"What will it be this time?

Again he feels a tap on his shoulder. Hanging his head, John turns around to see the bear there again smiling at him.\n\nThe bear says, \"You ain't here for the hunting are you boy...\"",

Repulsed the dog says,\"I haven't eaten in days think I can get a sandwich I know a good place down the road but I'll need about tree fiddy\" It was about that time Tim realized his dog was actually a crustacean from the paleolithic era and Tim said,\"Damnit loch Ness monster I aint giving you no tree fiddy get off my lawn!\"",

He confronted the clone in their twentieth story office, and braving a three minute uninterrupted litany of expletives, pushed the unreasonable double out the window, where he fell to his death.\n\nThe police arrived, and once the situation was explained, the geneticist laughed, disbelieving any statute covered the destruction of one's genetic clone.

I was a vacuum salesman back in North Dakota.\"\n\nWell, the boss was unsure, but he liked the kid and figured he'd give him a shot, so he gave him the job.\n\"You start tomorrow. I'll come down after we close and see how you did.\"\n\nHis first day on the job was rough, but he got through it. After the store was locked up, the boss came down to the sales floor. \"How many customers bought something from you today?\" \n\nThe kid frowns and looks at the floor and mutters, \"One\". \n\nThe boss says \"Just one? Our sales people average sales to 25 to 30 customers a day. This is gonna have to change very soon if you'd like to continue your employment here. We have very strict standards for our sales force here in Florida. One sale a day might have been acceptable in North Dakota, but you're not on the farm anymore, son.\"\n\nThe kid took his beating, but continued to look at his shoes, so the boss felt kinda bad for chewing him out on his first day. He asked (sarcastically), \"So, how much was your one sale for?\"\n\nThe kid looks up at his boss and says \"$124,548.88\".\n\nThe boss, astonished, says $124,548.88??? What the heck did you sell?\"\n\nThe kid says, \"Well, first, I sold him some new fish hooks. Then I sold him a new fishing rod to go with his new hooks. Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the boat department and I sold him a twin engine Chris Craft. Then he said he didn't think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him down to the automotive department and sold him that 4x4 Chevrolet Suburban.\"\n\nThe boss said \"A guy came in here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a boat and a SUV???\"\n\nThe kid said \"No, the guy came in here to buy tampons for his wife, and I said, 'Bro, your weekend's a mess, you should go fishing.\"\n",

        "body": "There was once a priest who went to see the world after taking his oath. After many years of wandering, he finally arrived in a small village in the middle of nowhere. The people there believed in the same religion as he did, but they had no church; they had to go to the nearest one which was in a small town 25 km's from there. The priest took the initiative, asked the Church for support, and with the help of the local men they built their own temple. From there on, he was celebrating the Sunday masses, joining together men and women in Holy Matrimony, and saying prayers at the funerals.\n\nMany years passed by like that.\n\nAt the end of an ordinary mass, in early spring, on a chilly Sunday morning he was just guiding the people out of the church, was about to close the gates when an unknown man stepped into the churchyard.\n\nWith his dirty and torn clothes, he stood before the priest and said:\n\n- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was a good man, and even though he thought the request was a bit strange, he went back to the rectory, took out a lemon, cut it in half, took it back to the man and gave it to him, who looked back to the priest with gratitude. However, the priest was curious. He asked:\n\n- Son, why do you need this half of a lemon? - with a fright on his face, and before the priest could have said a thing, he rushed out of the churchyard gate and took off.\n\nA week later, around the same time, when the priest was leaving the church, he found himself in front of the same man in the churchyard. The man said:\n\n- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was surprised by the appearance of the man and his strange request. Of course he was good, went back to the rectory, and brought the half lemon. Placed it in the stranger's hand and immediately he asked:\n\n- Here it is, my dear son, but please tell me why do you need this half a lemon? - the man was obviously frightened and immediately ran away but the priest was not sluggish either and ran after him. He wasn't in a very good condition, he has never run so much and so fast before so he was out of breath by the end of the village, almost fainted. He thought the strange man might appear again next week, and it would be nice if he could keep up with him, so he spent his week working on his cardio. It turned out to be a good idea, because as he thought, the stranger entered the churchyard on Sunday. The priest didn't even wait for the request, he was good, and brought the half lemon. He received these words from the man:\n\n- Thank you priest for being so good and giving me half a lemon.\n\n- Don't mention it son, -said the priest- but please tell me, what do you need it for?! - by the time he finished his sentence the man was already running, but the priest was close behind. They were running for a while and the priest was starting to feel exhausted when they arrived at a wide and swift river. The stranger without thinking threw himself into the river and swam across the river and disappeared on the other side. The priest didn't follow because he couldn't swim. He was annoyed when he got home. He spent the next week learning to swim at the swimming pool in the small town 25 km's away. He was anxiously waiting for the next Sunday; now he was sure that the weird fellow would visit again. On Sunday, as he was closing the church, the gate creaked, and entered the man:\n\n- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was good, went back, put on his swimming trunks, his running shoes, grabbed half of the lemon and took it to the stranger:\n\n- Here it is, my son, but please tell me already, why do you need it? - the guy was terrified, rushed out the gate with the priest following. Reached the river, swam across, the priest right behind him. He kept running on the other side of the river and the priest was still on his tail. They kept running until they got to a tall tree on the verge of a deep ravine. The man climbed the tree with the agility of a cat, the priest not knowing how to climb a tree, stood on the ground. He was cursing everything as he walked back home. The following week the villagers watched as the priest in the garden of the church climbs trees, jumping back and forth, and generally behaving very strangely. The priest didn't care, he was exercising obsessively, preparing himself for the meeting. On Sunday before the mass, he put on his trunks and running shoes under his cassock. In fact, he was good and put half a lemon in his pocket in advance. The mass finished much earlier than usually, and he emptied the church as soon as possible so he could warm up. In the same exact time the mass should have ended, the strange man entered the churchyard.\n\n- Priest, please be good... - the priest was already handing him half of a lemon, and asked:\n\n- Son, why do you need it for God's sake? - the man ran away terrified, the priest followed him. They ran to the river, swam across, ran to the tree, climbed up. The priest almost catched the stranger when he grabbed a vine and swung to the other side of the ravine. The priest was about to have a stroke, but then he saw another vine. Whoop, he grabbed it and swung across. There, however, he encountered an unexpected obstacle: it was a plane graveyard and the man closed himself in one of the wreckages. The priest was raging as he walked around the wreckage several times, but he found no entrance except for the sealed door on the side of the plane; he had to open it somehow. He was furious but he went home. He spent every day at the village's locksmith and learned every possible way of opening a lock. On Sunday he held the mass in his swimming trunks, running shoes, on his back in a waterproof backpack was a crowbar, a cutting torch, a wrench and a drill, then he stood in front of the church and waited for the man. He was there on time.\n\n- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon!\n\n- There you go, son - handing him the lemon, because he was good, but in the same time he grabbed the stranger's arm, pulled him close, and with obsession in his eyes, asked:\n\n- But what do you need it for?! - panic came over the man as he made his escape from the priest's hands and ran away, but the priest was very close behind. Racing to the river they quickly got across, running up the tree almost breaking their necks, one after the other swung across the ravine, the man barely managed to close the door of the wreckege in the priest's face. Little did he know that the priest would not stop there, because he grabbed his backpack and started working on the lock with his tools. In less than an hour the heavy door creaked open. Inside, the stranger was shivering in horror, he was afraid of the priest's fierce and triumphant look. The priest slowly strode up to the man, crouched down, and very quietly, with a friendly smile on his face, gently asked:\n\n- Son. You have been asking for half a lemon for the last few weeks. I'm very happy to give it to you, even in the future, I am only asking in return that you tell me: why do you need it?\n\n- All right, priest ... - came the answer in a trembling tone - I will answer your question, but please, be good, and do not tell anyone.\n\nThe priest was good, and never told anyone.",

This great emperor had the most beautiful wife in all the realms.\n\nAt the palace, there lived a certain Ahmed who was a low-ranking official. He took a liking to the queen, and his greatest desire was to kiss the queen's gorgeous breasts.\n\nOnce, he told Birbal, the emperor's minister about this secret desire. He also told him he'd do anything to touch the queen's breasts with his mouth. Birbal, who was a very cunning man, said the following:\n\n'Look Ahmed, this isn't a small thing you're asking from me, but I'll help you! Obviously, it'll cost you some money. If you give me 500 gold pieces though, I'll arrange the whole thing and you'll be able to kiss the queen's breasts for three whole hours... without any consequences you should worry about!'\n\nAhmed was extremely happy about this. They agree that after the deed is done, Ahmed will pay Birbal 500 gold pieces. The next day, Birbal secretly put a special susbtance on the queen's bra that caused serious itching. The emperor then gathered his doctors (who had been bribed by Birbal beforehand) so they could establish the cause of the itching. After some time, the doctors gave their diagnosis to the emperor:\n\n'This is a very dangerous disease that spreads at a horrendous speed! There's only one cure: a specific kind of human saliva. Unfortunately, there's only a single man whose saliva is suitable for the treatment in the whole of India: your humble servant and subject, Ahmed.'\n\nThe emperor immediatly summoned Ahmed and commanded him to heal the queen's breasts with his saliva. And thus it came to pass that Ahmed could fervently lick and suck and kiss the queen's breasts for three whole hours. After that time passed, he left the royals' presence with an otherwordly smile.\n\nThe next morning, Birbal came to his room to ask for his rightful payment. However, Ahmed announced that he wasn't really serious about those 500 gold coins, and that he didn't have that much money anyways.\n\nBut that was without counting with Birbal's revenge. The next day, Birbal smuggled that special substance into the emperor's underwear... and soon, Emperor Akbar summoned Ahmed...",

How Odin must have forgotten him, for how else would his beard have continued to grow so much..\nBenny couldn't take it anymore..

Also, every morning I wake up to the same prune-face old crone to whom I pledged my vows so many years ago. I used to love her, but that love has become like some sun-festering beached whale trying to die. We lost our daughter last year to one of the bitterest, coldest winters we've ever had to face in this region. Isn't it funny, doc, how all the prayer circles and charity drives in the world amount to pretty much nothing in the face of that cold, impartial face of winter, that bleak, pounding, harsh fist of a callous environment, carrying on with its machinations without regard to our lives, loves, hopes and dreams? Isn't that hysterical, Doc? Oh and then there's my son. Doc, I don't love him anymore. I don't know what it is but I look in his eyes and I see that same harried look of gutless cowardice that I see when I stare at my own face in the mirror. If I wasn't such a coward, Doc, I know I'd be able to scrape together enough pride to grab that cocked and loaded shotgun I keep by the bedside table, and just run amok and put an end to this grim facade once and for all. I start with the wife, then the boy of course before putting the barrell in my own mouth. Believe you me, Doc, I'd be doing the world a favor. I have nothing to look forward to but a continuation of this spiraling black hole that is my life, this existential cesspool that is the perpetuation of my lingering skid-mark on society. I despise people yet I crave their approval. I'm judgemental yet I care about nothing. I'm bitter, hateful and afraid. I'm alive yet I feel like the walking dead. This is it, Doc: I am a living, breathing, disease.\"\n\n\n\nThe doctor stares at him for a while then finally says \"Jeez, Moth, you definitely have some problems. But I'm a podiatrist.

You have summoned me and shall be granted three wishes! \n\nJohnny jumped for joy. He sat and pondered what his wishes would be. First, he wanted a new place to live. the old wooden shack he called a home was falling apart. \"I want a marble mansion with full furnishings.\" said Johnny. The genie waved his hand. \"It is done. There is now a mansion where that old shack once stood.\"\n\nJohnny though about all the parties he could throw, but he wasn't the best looking guy in town. He stood up, \"I want a hot wife-wait, no. I want a haram of hot wives.\" The genie once gain waved his hand. \"When you go back to your new mansion, there will be numerous brides anticipating your arrival.\"\n\nJohnny though hard about his last wish. He had the house and many pretty girls. What could be the frosting on the cake? After a few minutes of thinking, Johnny stepped forward. \"Genie? If it isn't too much to ask, could I be hung like a nigger?\" The Genie scowled but still decided to grant his final wish. \"When you go back to your home, you will find all your wishes have come true. I bid thee farewell!\"\n\nThe Genie disappeared back into his lamp. Johnny was excited. He skipped almost all the way back home. It was everything he imagined when he got there. The mansion was huge and all of his new wives were greeting him at the front door. He threw the biggest party that night. Only one thing was missing: his penis size. Had the genie forgotten to grant the last wish after all? As the party was winding down, Johnny heard a screech of tires and several men yelling. Suddenly, six men in white robes burst through the mansions front door and seize Johnny. Confused and babbling, Johnny is pulled out of his mansion and hung from a tree in his front yard.\n\nThe End.",

When he passes the 10th floor, the high wind whips him around the building and back into the 10th floor window and he takes the elevator back up to the bar. \n\nThe 2nd Man tells him: \"You know I saw that with my own eyes, but that must have been a one time fluke.\" \n\n1st Man: \"No, I'll prove it again\" and again he jumps and hurtles toward the street where the 10th floor wind gently carries him around the building and into the window. Once upstairs he urges his fellow drinker to try it. \n\n2nd Man: \"Well what the heck, it works, I'll try it.\" So he jumps over the balcony, plunges downward, passes the 11th, 10th, 9th, 8th floors and hits the sidewalk with a 'splat.' \n\nBack upstairs the Bartender turns to the other drinker: \n\n\"You know, Superman, you're a real jerk when you're drunk.",

Do you think I could stay the night?\u201d\n\nThe monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.\n\nThe next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you. You\u2019re not a monk.\u201d\n\nThe man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.\n\nSome years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.\n\nThe monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.\n\nThe next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you. You\u2019re not a monk.\u201d\n\nThe man says, \u201cAll right, all right. I\u2019m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?\u201d\n\nThe monks reply, \u201cYou must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.\u201d\n\nThe man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, \u201cI have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.\u201d\n\nThe monks reply, \u201cCongratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.\u201d\n\nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \u201cThe sound is right behind that door.\u201d\n\nThe man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, \u201cReal funny. May I have the key?\u201d\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens the door.\n\nBehind the wooden door is another door made of stone.\n\nThe man demands the key to the stone door.\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.\n\nHe demands another key from the monks, who provide it.\n\nBehind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.\n\nSo it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.\n\nFinally, the monks say, \u201cThis is the last key to the last door.\u201d\n\nThe man is relieved to no end.\n\nHe unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.\n\nBut I can\u2019t tell you what it is because you\u2019re not a monk",

Next, they went out in the back yard to survey the championship-style golf course that the home was located on. They would have golfing privileges every day and each week, the course changed to a new one representing the great golf courses on earth. The old man asked, 'What are the green fees?'\n\nSt. Peter replied, 'This is heaven, you play for free.' Next, they went to the club house and saw the lavish buffet lunch with the cuisine's of the World laid out. 'How much to eat?' asked the old man.\n\n'Don't you understand yet? This is heaven, it is free!' St. Peter replied, with some exasperation. 'Well, where are the low fat and low cholesterol tables?' the old man asked timidly. St. Peter lectured, 'That's the best part - you can eat as much as you like of whatever you like and you never get fat and you never get sick. This is Heaven.'\n\nWith that, the old man went into a fit of anger, throwing down his hat and stomping on it, and screaming wildly. St. Peter and his wife both tried to calm him down, asking him what was wrong. The old man looked at his wife and said, 'This is all your fault! If it weren't for your blasted bran muffins and exercise, I could have been here ten years ago!'\n\n",

That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.\n\nThe next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you. You\u2019re not a monk.\u201d\n\nThe man says, \u201cAll right, all right. I\u2019m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?\u201d\n\nThe monks reply, \u201cYou must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.\u201d\n\nThe man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, \u201cI have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.\u201d\n\nThe monks reply, \u201cCongratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.\u201d\n\nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \u201cThe sound is right behind that door.\u201d\n\nThe man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, \u201cReal funny. May I have the key?\u201d\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens the door.\n\nBehind the wooden door is another door made of stone.\n\nThe man demands the key to the stone door.\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.\n\nHe demands another key from the monks, who provide it.\n\nBehind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.\n\nSo it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.\n\nFinally, the monks say, \u201cThis is the last key to the last door.\u201d\n\nThe man is relieved to no end.\n\nHe unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.\n\nBut I can\u2019t tell you what it is because you\u2019re not a monk",

We then walk into this bar as the bartender is kicking out this duck, WTF?

He had wished for a monster cock. I nod sympathetically. I tell him that \"once I found a mermaid who said she'd grant me one wish. I asked for a little head, and that's how I ended up like this\". The chicken admits \"Oh, I didn't want to ask because I thought it would be too personal. You gotta be careful around those wish granters\". Then, an Irishman, an American, and a Frenchman walk into the bar. Anyway, after having too much to drink, Chicken and I walk out of the bar.

What can I do for you?\"    \n\"Well, I dunno. What do you charge?\"    \n\"I get $100 just for a handjob. We can negotiate from there.\"    \n\"$100!! For a handjob? Are you nuts?\"    \n\"You see that Ferrari out there?\"\n\nThe guy looks out the front door, and sure enough there's a shiny new Ferrari parked outside.\n\n\"I paid cash for that Ferrari with the money I made on handjobs. \"Trust me, it's worth it.\"\n\nThe guy mulls it over for a while, and decides what the hell. He leaves with her, and gets the most unbelievable experience he's ever had. This handjob was better than any complete sexual experience in his miserable life. The next night he's back at the bar, waiting eagerly for her to show up.\n\nWhen she does, he immediately approaches her.\n\n\"Last night was incredible!\", he exclaims    \n\"Of course it was.

C'mon, that's ridiculous!\"    \n\"You see that apartment building across the street?\"\n\nThe guy looks out front at a 12 story penthouse apartment building.\n\n\"I paid cash for that building with the money I made on blowjobs. Trust me, it's worth it.\"\n\nBased on the night before, the guy decides to go for it. He leaves with her, and once again is not disappointed. He nearly faints - twice. The next night he can hardly contain himself until she shows up.\n\n\"I'm hooked, you're the best! Tell me, what'll it cost me for some pussy?\", he begs the blond.\n\nShe motions for him to follow her outside. She points down the street, where between the buildings he can see Manhattan.\n\n\"You see that island?\"    \n\"Aw, c'mon! You can't be serious about that!\"\n\nShe nods her head.\n\n\"You bet.

        "body": "\u2026. most of you are familiar with the stories of Alice in Wonderland and Beauty and the Beast. \n\nWhat most of you don\u2019t know is that these two stories are connected by White Rabbit, who visited Beast\u2019s castle on the way to the hole near Alice\u2019s house. In fact, right outside the castle, the rabbit was running and, rather embarrassingly, fell headlong into the mud.\n\nKeep in mind that White Rabbit was a high officer of a rather powerful monarch and a standing Court. He thought nothing of approaching Beast\u2019s large castle and asking for help. If you\u2019ve seen the curiosities and wonders of the Red Queen\u2019s lands, you\u2019ll anticipate that White Rabbit wasn\u2019t fazed when a dancing duster answered the door. \n\nWith haste and flourish, he recounted his trouble and asked that the castle\u2019s distinguished ruler take mercy on him and provide him with a bath and a change of clothing. The duster brought him to Lumi\u00e8re who reminded his master of a standing treaty. Beast, too dejected and detached to allow his anger to rise, didn\u2019t even look at White Rabbit and gave a quiet approval.\n\nThe White Rabbit took a great, long bath and had never felt so clean. \n\nIt turned out that none of Lumi\u00e8re\u2019s clothing fit White Rabbit so the walking candlestick brought the rabbit to Cogsworth. Cogworth brought the rabbit to his room and said, hushed, that he was more than willing to lend him clothing but that it would require White Rabbit keep his darkest secret. Being high officer of a rather powerful monarch and a standing Court, White Rabbit was used to secrets and was able to quell the poor clock\u2019s worry. \n\nCogsworth\u2019s secret, it turned out, was that he preferred ladies\u2019 undergarments to men\u2019s. This was hardly a secret in White Rabbit\u2019s mind. Cogsworth should only hear some of the card guard\u2019s secrets\u2026 the Red Queen would have their heads! But, familiar with bunny trails and not wanting to go down this particular one, White Rabbit donned the clock\u2019s underthings as a gesture of good faith. Cogsworth blushed but his fears were assuaged: his secret remained safe and he was able to aid a fellow agent in need. \n\nWhile White Rabbit was changing, Cogsworth (as an additional favour) had the rabbit\u2019s pocket watch cleaned thoroughly, wound properly, and reset to the proper time. But in a moment of brain lapse he set the watch to local time and not to Wonderland time and completely forgot to inform the rabbit!\n\nSo they kept each other company to the large banquet room that we know from the film where White Rabbit was treated to a more-than-adequate meal and performance. The cabaret would have given any show in France a run for its money. And White Rabbit, partly out of respect for his hosts and partly out of sheer amusement lost track of time. But then, catching a glimpse of his pocket watch, stood up straight on his back paws, announced that he was late for a very important date, and sprang out the door while still wearing Cogsworth clothing!\n\nHe ran and bounced. This is where he caught up with Alice and if you\u2019re interested, I highly recommend L. Carroll\u2019s thorough account of this part of the story. \n\nWhite Rabbit didn't have a chance to check a proper clock until long after his return to Wonderland. So it turned out that he had arrived to his destination after all, just in the knickers of time.\n",

        "body": "There was a school in England which was infamous for having the savage bullies. The school used to come in the news fairly regularly for nothing but their bullies. More often than not the school bullies used to line up the other students and hit them in the face. The consequences of not being present in the line were worse than getting *punched* in the face, so helplessly once a week on Monday all the students lined up. The children were made to line up on the football pitches far away from the school building so the teachers wouldn't catch them too often. \n\nThe bullies were usually the eldest students in school on that particular day, and the line was particularly *bad* when the bullies were 16 year olds, and was terrible when the bullies were even younger.\n\nA new teacher had joint school and she had heard so much about the bullying and she had zero tolerance for harassment of any sort. She decided that she's going to catch the bullies responsible for this. \n\nSo every Monday she would go to the football pitches and catch the bullies but there always used to be a *bad line*, and so she would never catch the eldest students who were the linchpins in this entire bullying scheme. She had never even seen the *terrible line*, she always used to catch the 16, and so one day she decided to use the genie lamp that she had since she was in her early twenties. She had used 2 wishes from the genie, and decided that she would use her last wish to try and catch the bullies in charge. \n\nHer two previous wishes were used on becoming the most knowledgeable economics teacher in the UK and to be an extremely fun teacher in the classroom. These two wishes were granted to her by the genie and it helped her land the teaching job at this school. \n\nShe rubbed the lamp and the genie came out, she then went on to explain to the genie about the punching situation in the school and how all the students were made to stand in a line. She then went on to explain how she had only been catching the *bad line* of students and how she wished that she could catch the other bullies. The genie nodded and told her that things would be different tomorrow. \n\nSo the next Monday the teacher went to school like normal, and saw that there were no 16 year olds in school. This intrigued her, but at least she knew she that she wouldn't see the *bad line*, this excited her. She had dreamt of this day where she would finally catch the other bullies who were *punching* all the students.\n\nThe teacher began to walk towards the football field not knowing what to anticipate as she had never seen any other line apart from the *bad* one.\n\nOnce she reached there she knew that the genie had fulfilled her wish once again because, in front of her she saw it; the punchline, and it was *terrible*.

There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, \u2018No, this is my first time.\u2019\n\nSo she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.\n\n\u2018Just a minute,\u2019 she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. \u2018Do these excite you?\u2019 She asked.\n\nWell, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.\n\n\u2018Well, come on\u2019, she said, \u2018We don\u2019t have much time.\u2019 So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.\n\nShe looked at me with a bit of a frown. \u2018Did you put that condom on?\u2019 she asked.\n\nI said, \u2018I sure did,\u2019 and held up my thumb to show her.",

As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.\n\nThe next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you. You\u2019re not a monk.\u201d\n\nThe man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.\n\nSome years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.\n\nThe monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.\n\nThe next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you. You\u2019re not a monk.\u201d\n\nThe man says, \u201cAll right, all right. I\u2019m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?\u201d\n\nThe monks reply, \u201cYou must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.\u201d\n\nThe man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, \u201cI have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.\u201d\n\nThe monks reply, \u201cCongratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.\u201d\n\nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \u201cThe sound is right behind that door.\u201d\n\nThe man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, \u201cReal funny. May I have the key?\u201d\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens the door.\n\nBehind the wooden door is another door made of stone.\n\nThe man demands the key to the stone door.\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.\n\nHe demands another key from the monks, who provide it.\n\nBehind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.\n\nSo it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.\n\nFinally, the monks say, \u201cThis is the last key to the last door.\u201d\n\nThe man is relieved to no end.\n\nHe unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.\n\nBut I can\u2019t tell you what it is because you\u2019re not a monk",

It was watched live by tens of thousands, and broadcast on countless major networks. For near a decade, it had been won by Jean-Baptiste, the undisputed master of the silent debate. This year he was being challenged by a true dark horse, Joe from Brooklyn. \n\nThe debate begins and a hush falls over the crowd. Jean-Baptiste opens by holding out a raised index finger, slowly moving it in front of him. Joe counters, doing the same with his middle and index fingers. Jean responds by repeating the gesture, this time with 3 fingers. Joe is the first to buck the trend, raising a fist in front of his face. Jean-Baptiste makes wide sweeping arcs in front of himself and to the side with his open palms. Joe grabs his right arm right around the crook of his elbow and violently thrusts his fist in front of himself again. Jean is in a tough spot, but confident. He has something incredibly profound, a move he has kept in his back pocket but never had to use up until this moment. He calmly raises his right hand and forms a circle with his thumb and forefinger. The crowd gasps, sure Joe is beat. Joe looks on, puts the backs of his hands against his cheek, and rapidly wriggles his fingers while his face jerks back and forth. Jean-Baptiste goes red in the face upon seeing this, and flees the stage. Joe has won.\n\nAfter the debate reporters are everywhere taking statements from the competitors. One corners Jean-Baptiste and asks him what happened. \"Well,\" says Jean, \"I began by saying 'Singularity,' to which Joe said 'Duality.' I said 'Trinity,' and Joe said 'Power.' I tried to appeal to reason, and said 'Peace,' but he countered with 'Absolute Power.' I finally said 'Divinity.' Surely no man can argue against the divine! But he did that... thing, with such passion and self assurance, and I don't even know what he said. He counters me and I cannot even conceive of his argument. I am truly beat.\"\n\nThe reporters are now whipped into a frenzy; they must know what it was that Joe said. They find him backstage, already celebrating with pounding music and copious amounts of alcohol. When asked about the debate, Joe says, \"Yeah alright. So this guy comes out and he says to me, he says 'I'm gonna stick my finger up your asshole.' I say 'Oh yeah? I'll stick two fingers up your asshole!' He says 'You do that and you'll be getting 3 fingers up your asshole.' I says 'Buddy, I will stick my whole damn fist up your asshole.' Now this guy says, 'Whoa whoa, back off. You can't stick your fist up my asshole.' I says 'Tough shit buddy, I'll stick my fist up your asshole all the way to my elbow.' And then he says, 'But my asshole is only *this big*' So I tells him, 'Then I guess we'll have to make it a little wider!'\"",

The case was scheduled to be tried before the justice of the peace in the back room of the general store. \nAs soon as the rancher showed up, the attorney for the railroad pulled him aside and tried to get him to settle out of court. The lawyer did his best selling job, and finally the rancher agreed to take half of what he was asking. \nAfter the rancher had signed the release and took the check, the young lawyer couldn't resist gloating a little over his success, telling the rancher, \"You know, I hate to tell you this, old man, but I put one over on you in there. I couldn't have won the case. The engineer was asleep and the fireman was in the caboose when the train went through your ranch that morning. I didn't have one witness to put on the stand. I bluffed you!\" \nThe old rancher replied, \"Well, I'll tell you, young feller, I was a little worried about winning that case myself, because that darned bull came home this morning.\"\n\n",

If you manage to do all four challenges before we close up for the night, you'll be swimming in more alcohol then you'll know what to do with. For the first challenge, you'll need to nail this railroad spike,\" as he picked up a 12-incher from behind the bar and placed it on top, \"into the sticking post in the men's room with any of the eggs from the pickle jar. After, you'll need to climb up to the roofline of this establishment. From there, you'll be pissing into one of our shotglasses filling it up to the brim. Then, there's Rocky, the rottweiler in the yard out back. You'll need to pull the thorn out of his paw, and he doesn't much like strangers. Finally, you'll be going upstairs where you'll find my grandmother, the most insatiable, randy woman in this town in the past sixty years. If you can give her the best fucking of her life, you'll win your prize.\"\n\nBy this point, the entire bar establishment had gathered to see if the old coot will follow through with the challenges. He immediately snatched up the railroad spike, reached barehanded into the pickle jar to yank out an egg, and marched straight into the lavatory, where he's followed by a few male patrons to witness this act. The restroom erupted with cheers, hollers, and hoots interspersed with the old man's \"goddammit\"s, \"shiiiit\"s, and \"ah fucking hell\"s. Eventually a unified cheer erupted within the small area of the bar and the old man walks out with one egg-covered, bloody stump of a hand and a smirk.\n\nHe marched back over to the bar, tapped the bartop, and said, \"My drinkssh, pleeash...\"\n\nThe bartender poured out ten shots of the cheapest swill he carried and the drunk downed em as quickly as they're poured without crossing his eyes. He kept the final shotglass in hand as he made his way out the front door. A vast majority of the bar followed him out, starting up a rhythmic chant to keep him going. You could tell from within the bar that it must have been going well, since the rhythm of the chant picked up more and more after awhile and ended with another unified cheer.\n\nThe old drunk stumbled back in and, wordlessly, pointed his finger on top of the bar again. The bartender set up another ten shots and the drunk gulped down all ten. The entire bar was erupting with cheers at this point. The drunk then took a deep breath and barely kept himself upright as he veritably flopped out the back door, naturally followed by almost the entire bar at this point. However, once in the yard, instead of the usual cheers that occurred, there was a smattering of \"oooh\"s and \"uuuuhhhh\"s, interjected by occasional \"what the fuck\"s. There could be heard between the reactions of the crowd the growls and snarls of a wild beast, followed by loud yelps and extremely loud whimpering. Eventually, hushed silence followed and some of the patrons preceded the stumbling, old drunk as they dove straight for restrooms, covering the vomit in their mouths.\n\nThe drunk, now covered in scrapes, scratches, and abrasions, pointed to the bar again as the bartender already began lining up glasses and shots for him to down. Once the last shot had been drunk, and everyone was certain the old man wouldn't keel over or pass out, he managed to half speak, half belch...\n\n\"Now, where's that old bitch with the thorn in her paw?!?\"",

Glazed, old-fashioned, even apple fritters, you name it, he has it in his truck. Now this man is in a hurry, and he's driving pretty fast, about 60 mph. He's driving along, and he suddenly hits a bump. His truck jumps a little, but he's fine, still on the road. Then, he begins to speed up. He gets up to 80 mph, on this road just feet from a cliff. Then he hits a second bump. A little bit more of a jolt, but ultimately nothing to be concerned about. The man isn't scared at all, and gets his truck up to 100 mph. At this breakneck speed, he hits a third bump. This time, a donut flies out of his truck, off the cliff, and into the ocean below, where a fish eats it.\n\nJoke 2: A man gets married to a beautiful wife, and for their honeymoon they decide to go on a cruise. During the cruise, the man is leaning against the railing thinking about how wonderful his life is. Unfortunately, the man had quickly developed a bad habit of twirling his wedding ring around his finger. While doing so, he accidentally knocks it off of his finger and into water. The man dejectedly explains to his wife what happened. She's pretty angry, so to make it up to her, he takes her to a really fancy restaurant after they dock. After long deliberation, the man orders the fish. The fish arrives, steaming and beautifully cooked. The man cuts into it, and is shocked at what is inside. He just can't believe what he sees. A free donut!\n\n(For optimal telling, wait a few minutes after telling the first)",

When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.\u201d\n\nThe man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.

Then one Christmas day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the bed covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. Sometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bath room. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, \u201cHoney you were right\u2026 all these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked his wife. \u201cWell, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened, but by the grace of god, some Vaseline and two fingers.

You\u2019re not a monk.\u201d The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.\n\n\nSome years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.\n\n\nThe next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you. You\u2019re not a monk.\u201d The man says, \u201cAll right, all right. I\u2019m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?\u201d\n\n\nThe monks reply, \u201cYou must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.\u201d\n\n\nThe man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, \u201cI have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.\u201d\n\n\nThe monks reply, \u201cCongratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.\u201d\n\n\nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \u201cThe sound is right behind that door.\u201d The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, \u201cReal funny. May I have the key?\u201d\n\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door.\n\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.\n\n\nSo it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks say, \u201cThis is the last key to the last door.\u201d\n\n\nThe man is relieved to no end. The monk unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.\n\n\nBut I can\u2019t tell you what it is because you\u2019re not a monk.",

This made her happier but she was still concerned as to why he didn't seem to care.

The man launched into such a powerful piece that it moved the manager to tears. Wiping his eyes he was slightly hesitant but summoned up the courage and asked the man the name of that piece.\n\"That was called *'I wanked on you mum's face and she asked for more with a side fries'* \"\n\nThe Manager looks at the man for a moment, and then says \"You are a terrific talent so you're hired but for God's sake please don't say the names of the songs to the patrons.\"\n\nThe first night was going very well and a lot of people were turning up to listen to the new pianist who was playing wonderful music and as requested the man never announced the names of any of his tunes. During a break the man was feeling horny and decided to go off to the bathroom for a quick wank in one of the stalls. Just as he was finishing the manager comes bursting into the bathroom and yells \"Hey if you're in here then hurry up we've got a LOT of customers awaiting your return to the stage!\"\n\nThe man, startled, starts making his way out through the crowd to the piano. On the way a customer pulls him aside and says \"Mate, do you know your fly is unzipped and your cock is hanging out with cum on the end of it??\"\n\nThe man looks at him and says \" Know it? I fucking wrote it!!\"",

When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.\u201d\n\nThe man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.

There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.\u201d\n\nThe monks reply, \u201cCongratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.\u201d\n\nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \u201cThe sound is right behind that door.\u201d\n\nThe man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, \u201cReal funny.

They kept looking for a suitable place to stay the night when they saw a warm cabin with its windows lit up down aways. When the reached the cabin They ran up to the only entrance and frantically banged on the door. \n  An old lady told them to stop their banging and she was on her way. When she opened the door the three men were greeted with a toothless smile of an old lady missing most of her hair. She asked the men what they were doing at her cabin in the middle of a blizzard. The novice skier said they got lost and needed a place to stay or they would all freeze to death. The lady pondered for a minute and told them they could stay on one condition. That they fucked her silly until she passed out. The most novice skier said hell to the no and waited for the other two to come to the same conclusion he did. The next skier thought for a moment and said he'll take his chances outside. The third skier waited almost two minutes before he said she'll have to time of her life that night. \n The lady let him in and closed the door after him. She sat down on her sofa, spread her legs and lifted her dress. The unfortunate man was greeted with the smell of what he thought death would smell like. Yet he persevered and pulled down her panties. The sight was horrible. she had a scab covering her whole vagina. But this nasty skier didn't let that stand between him and a warm night. He opened her window peeled that scab off and threw it out the window and fucked her until she passed out. He quickly fell asleep and when he woke up he went outside and saw his two friends waiting for him. He was amazed how had they stayed alive he thought. They told him that they had started a fire to stay warm and ate the piece of pizza he threw out the window so they wouldn't starve. ",

Its name is the 'sonofabitch fish.'\"  The nun thinks about this as she brings the fish back to her church.  She asks her priest for help cleaning the sonofabitch.  \"Sister!  You should not talk this way in a house of God.\"  \"No father, that is what this type of fish is called.\"  He then takes the fish and cleans it, and brings it to another nun, and asks her to cook the sonofabitch.  \"Father!  A man of the cloth should not speak so!\"  \"That is the name of the fish, I am not swearing.\"  So the nun cooks it. \n\nThat night, the pope decides on a surprise visit to their church.  The fish was smelling especially delicious, so the two nuns and the priest decide to serve it to their guest.  As they presented it to him, the first nun said \"I caught this sonofabitch!\"  The priest said, \"I cleaned this sonofabitch!\"  The second nun said, \"I cooked this sonofabitch!\"  The pope looked at them thoughtfully for a moment, and then responded:  \"You fuckers are all right.\"",

You'd better write it down because I know you'll forget it.\" The man replies, \"I can remember that! You want some cake with strawberries.\"\n\nShe adds, \"I'd also like whipped cream on top. Now I'm certain you're gonna forget that, so you'd better write it down ok.\" Irritated, he says, \"I don't need to write it down woman! I can remember that! Cake with strawberries! And whipped cream!\" He then grumbles into the kitchen. After about 30 minutes the old man returns from the kitchen and hands his wife a plate of bacon and eggs. She stares at the plate for a moment and says, \"Where's my toast?\n",

        "body": "So they put together an expedition to track down the lost treasures of Egypt. They weren't particularly successful, but they stumbled on the a tomb and decided to check it out, even though it wasn't on their list. Inside, there were three passageways with an inscription above each one. \n\n\"He who enters shall die a watery death\" read the first.\n\n\"He who enters shall die a fiery death\" read the second.\n\n\"He who enters shall die a mysterious death\" read the third.\n\nThe eldest brother had been a collegiate so he chose the first. The middle brother was a volunteer firefighter and chose the second. The youngest brother, being wholly unremarkable, took the third without complaint.\n\nThey decided to go one at a time, so as to not be all lost at once should the inscriptions prove truthful. The eldest entered walked down the hallway and was greeted by stairs that descended into darkness. He lit his torch and walked down. At the bottom, it opened up to a room filled with an amount of gold and gems he had not thought was possible. He emptied his pack and started stuffing it with gold, but the he heard a rush of air and water and the room began flooding. He scrambled, still trying to grab as much as he could carry. By the time he reached the stairs the water was above his head, running out of air, and the gold kept him from rising to the surface for air. He scrambled along the floor as fast as he could and made it to the top of the stairs where he broke the surface and gasped for air.\n\nBack at the entrance he greeted his brothers, told his tale, and displayed his spoils. The middle brother couldn't resist such temptation and decided he would risk it as well. The room at the bottom of his stairs was similarly splendorous, and as he grabbed what he could carry he felt the temperature rise. Lava started seeping in through holes in the wall faster than he'd ever seen. As he reached the stairs, the lava flow was mere inches behind him. However, he made it safely back to his brothers, the lava stopping at the top of the stairs just as the water did.\n\nThe youngest couldn't bear the shame of being outdone by his older brothers, so he too decided to enter his hallway. He had thought his brothers were telling tall tales when they had described the treasures that had awaited them, but he was surprised to see they were not. He nervously filled his bag, having no idea what might try to kill him, but there was nothing. He filled his pack, and walked back to his brothers who were none too happy about who easy he'd had it.\n\nThat being enough adventure for the three brothers, they returned home and cashed in their treasures. They had more money than any of them could spend. The eldest brother bought a rooftop suite, complete with a beautiful garden. The middle brother bought a mansion and hired staff to tend to his every need. The youngest bought a 3 bedroom house in the suburbs. Because he was wholly unremarkable.\n\nYears went by and the brothers forgot the omens. Until one day, the eldest was hosting a party, got outrageously drunk, and while he was attempting to pee in his garden he tripped and drowned in his koi pond. The two remaining brothers chalked it up to bad luck. The eldest had always partied too hard. So they went on with their lives, none the wiser as to the significance of the eldest's watery death. \n\nMonths go by and the middle brother, who had turned into a bit of a gourmet, was having a bananas foster flamb\u00e9ed tableside. As the flames roared, one of the waitstaff slipped in some water on the floor and fell into the portable stove, sending it, the flaming bananas foster, and the bottle of whiskey she'd been carrying onto the brother who burst into flames.\n\nAt the funeral the youngest, and now sole, brother contemplated his brothers' misfortune. He remembered the omens and decided to take precautions. \n\nHe built an underground fortress. Outfitted it with water pumps meant to keep battleships aflot, the worlds most advance fire suppression systems, surveillance that would thwart Tom Cruise, and the best private security he could buy. Months went by, he even began to feel safe again. \n\nThen, the alarms went off. He turned on the security feed in his room and saw guards running as fast as their legs could carry them. He heard the BOOM BOOM BOOM of something large approaching, but the feed cut out before it appeared on screen. The booms continued, never stopping, never slowing, even as the gun fire and explosions from his security teams were silenced. He peeked through the window in his door, hoping to catch a glimpse of whatever was attacking him.\n\nA great stone coffin descended down the stairs. The brother slammed the window shut, grabbed his gun, and pulled a pin from a grenade he kept at his bedside. The booms got louder until they reached his door and with a single almighty crash the 2000 lb metal door was sent flying across the room. The brother tossed the grenade into the hallway and dove into his bathroom. It didn't stop the coffin, and it lurched closer and closer. He emptied his clip at it, and accomplishing nothing he began throwing everything within reach in pure desperation. Having exhausted his improvised ammo, he grabbed the very last thing he could find, a bottle of Nyquil in his medicine cabinet, and threw it with all his might. The bottle shattered on the approaching obelisk, and finally, blessedly the coffin stopped.",

You\u2019re not a monk.\u201d\n\nThe man says, \u201cAll right, all right. I\u2019m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?\u201d\n\nThe monks reply, \u201cYou must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.\u201d\n\nThe man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, \u201cI have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.\u201d\n\nThe monks reply, \u201cCongratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.\u201d\n\nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \u201cThe sound is right behind that door.\u201d\n\nThe man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, \u201cReal funny. May I have the key?\u201d\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens the door.\n\nBehind the wooden door is another door made of stone.\n\nThe man demands the key to the stone door.\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.\n\nHe demands another key from the monks, who provide it.\n\nBehind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.\n\nSo it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.\n\nFinally, the monks say, \u201cThis is the last key to the last door.\u201d\n\nThe man is relieved to no end.\n\nHe unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.\n\nBut I can\u2019t tell you what it is because you\u2019re not a monk",

I would like to buy it for dinner\".\n\nThe fish monger says \"Of course!

That's just the type of fish it is.  It's a Sonuvabitch.\"\nThe priest falls for the lie and buys the fish.  He takes it back to the parish and tells the alter boy to \"Clean and prepare the Sonuvabitch, then give him to the nun to cook for the Pope.\"\n\nThe alter boy is shocked that the priest would swear, so the priest explains it was the type of fish and the alter boy understands and goes on his way.\n\nAfter the fish is cleaned and prepared, the alter boy takes the fish to the Nun and says \"The Father asks for you to cook this Sonuvabitch tonight for the Pope.\" The nun smacks him with a ruler and tells him to do a Hail Mary, but then the alter boy explains that he was told that's what the fish was called.  The nun apologizes for the smack and takes the fish to cook it into the best meal she's ever made.\n\nSo the Pope arrives around 6pm and dinner is at 7.  The priest, alter boy, and nun are extremely excited to meet the Pope and tell them how they made the meal he seems to really be enjoying.

In it were 3 empty beer cans and $81,874.25 in cash.\n\n She closed the box and put it back under the bed. Now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why there was such a box and with those contents. That evening, they were out for a special anniversary dinner. After dinner, Hillary could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed, saying, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Bill. For all these years, I kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed. However, today the temptation was too much and I gave in. But now I need to know, why do you keep the 3 beer cans in the box?\u201d\n\nBill thought for a while and said, \u201cI guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you, I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again.\u201d\n\nHillary was shocked, but said, \u201cHmmm, Jennifer, Paula and Monica. I\u2019m disappointed and saddened by your behavior; however, I guess it does happen and I guess 3 times is not that bad.\u201d\n\nBill thanked her for being so understanding. They hugged and made their peace.

I asked his wife if she minded him going to his grave wearing a black suit instead, and she said it made no difference as long as he looked nice.'\n'So I just switched the heads.'",

It was, \"Which of the following species of birds does not build its own nest, but instead lays its eggs in the nests of other birds? Is it A) the condor; B) the buzzard; C) the cuckoo; or D) the vulture?\" \n\nShe did not know the answer. And she was doubly on the spot because she had used up her 50/50 Lifeline and her Audience Poll Lifeline. All that remained was her Phone-a-Friend Lifeline, and the woman had hoped against hope that she would not have to use it. Mainly because the only friend that she knew would be home happened to be a blonde. \n\nBut the contestant had no alternative. She called her friend and gave her the question and the four choices. The blonde responded unhesitatingly: \"That's easy. The answer is 'C' -- the cuckoo.\"\n\nThe contestant had to make a decision and make it fast. She considered employing a reverse strategy and giving Regis any answer except the one that her friend had given her. And considering that her friend was a blonde, that would seem to be the logical thing to do. \n\nOn the other hand, the blonde had responded with such confidence, such certitude, that the contestant could not help but be persuaded. \n\nTime was up. \"I need an answer,\" said Regis. \n\nCrossing her fingers, the contestant said, \"C) the cuckoo.\" \n\n\"Is that your final answer?\" asked Regis. \n\n\"Yes, that is my final answer,\" she said, breaking into a sweat. \n\nAfter the usual foot-dragging delay Regis said, \"I regret to inform you that that answer is ... absolutely correct. You are now a millionaire!\" \n\nThree days later, the contestant hosted a party for her family and friends, including the blonde who had helped her win the million dollars. \n\n\"Jenny, I just do not know how to thank you,\" said the contestant. \"Because of your knowing the answer to that final question, I am now a millionaire. And do you want to know something? It was the assuredness with which you answered the question that convinced me to go with your choice.\" \n\n\"You're welcome!\" the blonde said. \n\n\"By the way,\" the winner said, not being able to contain the question anymore. \"How did you happen to know the right answer?\" \n\n\"Oh, come on,\" said the blonde. \"Everybody knows that cuckoos don't build nests.

He\u2019s going to be so angry if it\u2019s not ready on time.\u201d And she dashes out of her friend\u2019s house, her great hand forgotten on the table.\nWhen she gets home, she realizes she has very little time--not enough time to go to the supermarket--and all she has in the cupboard is a wilted lettuce leaf, an egg, and a can of cat food. In a panic, she opens the can of cat food, stirs in the egg, and garnishes it with the lettuce leaf just as her husband is pulling up. She watches in horror as he sits down to his dinner, and then she realizes he is loving it!\n\n\u201cMmmm, darling, this is the best dinner you have made for me in forty years of marriage. You can make this for me any old day, mmmmm!\u201d And that night they had sex for the first time in months and it was great!\n\nNeedless to say, every Thursday from then on, she made this dinner for her husband. She tells her bridge cronies about it and they are all horrified.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to kill him,\u201d they say, or, \u201cHe\u2019s just yanking your chain,\u201d but she continued to make him his cat food dinner and then, afterwards, they would bonk like fiends.\n\nTwo months later, her husband died and all the bridge women the Thursday after the funeral attacked our new widow for being so callous. \u201cYou killed him!\n\n\u201cWe told you that feeding him that cat food every week would do him in! How can you just sit there so calmly and play bridge knowing you murdered your husband?\u201d\n\nThe wife stoically replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t kill him. He fell off the mantle when he was licking his balls.\u201d ",

        "body": "An old monk is recounting his life to his nieces and nephews who lived in a small, rural town. The area around was hilly, and at the bottom of a nearby valley, there was a large, ornate monastery.\n\n\"Uncle, why did you become a monk?\" the youngest asked\n\n\"One day, I was riding my bicycle home from school, and passed through the valley. I picked up too much speed, and lost control  just outside of the monastery. I broke my arm, the bone protruding through the skin. I began to cry, and a monk emerged from the monastery to bring me inside.\n\n'I want to go to the hospital' I said\n\nThe monk replied 'There is no need. It is getting dark and we are trained in the secret healing arts of our order. We will send word to your parents and you will stay the night with us.'\n\nDuring that night, I awoke to a strange, ethereal sound coming from somewhere in the monastery. I thought it was a dream, and went back to sleep. In the morning, my arm was completely healed. I asked the monk from the night before what made the sound. The monk responded:\n\n'I cannot tell you, you are not a monk.'\n\nYears later, just after high school, I was riding a motorcycle down the same valley. A passing car came too close and clipped me, sending me flying into the ditch. I passed out from the pain of my injuries, I couldn't breathe and thought I was going to die. As my vision faded, I saw a monk running towards me.\n\nI woke up that night, sore, but alive - to the same sound as before. Naturally, I picked myself up - it seemed impossible but I grew stronger and more resilient every time I heard that sound. The sound grew slightly louder, and I followed it to an old door in the basement of the monastery. I pressed my ear against it. The sound was coming from within, but still distant even though I seemed so close.\n\n'You need a key'\n\nI jumped. I asked the monk who had appeared behind me, again, what was making the sound. He simply replied:\n\n'I cannot tell you, you are not a monk'\n\nI simply had to find out. I asked how to become a monk. I was told it meant I could not marry, or have children, and it would take years of study, some in silence, and I would live a pious life in peace if I were to become part of their order. I agreed. I spent years in silence, years copying texts, making wine. I paid my dues. I spent half my life learning to become part of the Order. One day they said I was ready. I was taken to the door and given a ring of keys.\n\nThe simple iron key fit into the lock on the wooden door. Behind the door was a path, leading down into the earth, like a tunnel. it was made of stone. As I made my way down the path, the sound became louder, and the air got warmer. I came to an iron door with a silver lock. The next tunnel was a steeper descent, and made entirely of iron. I came to another door, this time silver, with a gold lock. I used the golden key, and found a small opening just enough to crouch and crawl on my hands and knees. This tunnel was made of what I thought was silver. I did not need a torch, as light seemed to emanate from the air itself, now almost hot, humid. The sound was loud, I felt I was inside some intricate machine, but with a smell like fresh earth and blood. I got to a small door, made of gold, with a lock made of bone. I used a key made of what I could only assume was bone, and opened it.\n\nbeyond that final door I entered a massive, subterranean chamber, walls encrusted with all manner of crystals. The floor was earth, but littered with various bones. Some looked human. In the middle of the chamber, propped up on a platform made of all manner of skulls, was the source of the sound.\"\n\nThere was a long pause before the youngest asked\n\n\"Uncle... what was it?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you, you are not a monk.\"",

As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.\n\nThe next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you. You\u2019re not a monk.\u201d\n\nThe man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.\n\nSome years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.\n\nThe monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.\n\nThe next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you. You\u2019re not a monk.\u201d\n\nThe man says, \u201cAll right, all right. I\u2019m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?\u201d\n\nThe monks reply, \u201cYou must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.\u201d\n\nThe man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, \u201cI have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.\u201d\n\nThe monks reply, \u201cCongratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.\u201d\n\nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \u201cThe sound is right behind that door.\u201d\n\nThe man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, \u201cReal funny. May I have the key?\u201d\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens the door.\n\nBehind the wooden door is another door made of stone.\n\nThe man demands the key to the stone door.\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.\n\nHe demands another key from the monks, who provide it.\n\nBehind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.\n\nSo it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.\n\nFinally, the monks say, \u201cThis is the last key to the last door.\u201d\n\nThe man is relieved to no end.\n\nHe unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.\n\nBut I can\u2019t tell you what it is because you\u2019re not a monk",

She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe. \n\nThe next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her \"womanly\" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.\n\nBut the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.\n\nAnyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.",

        "body": "So there is this order of a thousand nuns who are on a pilgrimage. They go out into the wilderness and they walk all day, until finally near sunset, they see a large hotel surrounded by nothingness. This is a really big hotel, but it can only fit 500 people, so the more senior nuns got to go inside and sleep the hotel and half of the nuns had to stay outside and sleep on the ground. So they stay the night and in the morning, the nuns come out of the hotel and they find all of their sisters outside had been slaughtered in the night.\nOf Course they\u2019re really frightened, but the leader of the nuns, Mother Josephine, insisted that they continue on the pilgrimage. And in the distance, one of the nuns spots a small figure riding away in the direction they must go. So the remaining 500 nuns march away into the wilderness, and they walk all day and near sunset, they find themselves in front of a large mansion, but it\u2019s only big enough to fit 250 people, so again half the nuns have to stay inside. They see no other option for miles around, so reluctantly they chose the most senior nuns to stay in the house while the others stay outside. The next morning, like the one before, the nuns come out to find all of their fellow sisters outside have been killed in the night.\nOne of the sharper nuns look off into the distance and sees the same figure, and can make out the figure was on top of some sort of pack animal, and again, the figure was going in the same direction as they were going. Some of the nuns wanted to go back, but Mother Josephine said, this is a test of god\u2019s faith in us, we must continue our trek. SO they set off once again into the wilderness, and after a weary day of travel, they manage to find a really large house, big enough to be chosen sat and prayed for the ones outside, and they were very sad to see them left outside in the darkness. But once again, whey they woke up in the morning, they walked outside to find all of their sister dead.\nSome of the sisters look off into the distance and they can distinctly see a tall black rider on the back of what appeared to be a camel, going off towards the horizon, closer this time but still far away. They wearily continued their trek through the wasteland and near sunset they find themselves in front of a large cottage, roomy enough for 50 people to stay inside, while the other nuns did what they can to make themselves safe. They dug a ditch around where they were sleeping and filled it with sharpened spikes, and they set up a few nuns as watchers in the night, but all was to no avail for dawn the sun was up, another 50 nuns lay dead outside.\nThe remaining nuns prayed and buried their dead, and this time they can clearly see a man riding a camel, going off into the distance, with a white turban and a dark blue tunic. They had come too far to give up now, so once again, they set off through the barren wastes to continue their holy mission. Near sundown, they happen upon a large hut, with barely enough room inside to squeeze 25 people into, and this time only the leaders of their order, the ones who had preached and gathered up disciples for years were chosen to sleep inside, while the remaining nuns set up fires and torches to ward off any attack. The nuns inside were very sad to see them at their work for they knew that they were in great danger, and indeed whey dawn broke, those outside were once again found dead.\nShaken, but still faithful, the nuns continue on their journey, and the mysterious figure was even closer than before. They can see him not a mile away, riding away on a camel in the same direction that they were going. When it was nearing dusk, they found an abandoned shack that could only fit 10 people inside. The order\u2019s 10 most faithful nuns were chosen to sleep inside, while the others stood vigil throughout the night, praying god to help them in their time of need, but all they did was for naught for when the sun rose in the east, all those who were outside had met their end.\nThe remaining 10 nuns were all very old, having been preaching and helping the unfortunate for many, many years, so they made their way more slowly through the desolate land. Throughout the day, they could see the man on the camel, his dark black hair, his billowing robes, the bags on the back of his camel. He was but half a mile in front of them, and always heading in the same direction as they were. Soon, the shadows began to lengthen and just before night fell, they found themselves in front of this tiny lean-to that could just barely fit 5 people inside. They picked the 5 most respected nuns out of them all, most of them founders of their order, the original good souls who had helped so many people. They tearfully said goodbye to one another as the 5 who were not so lucky made a camp for the night. And in the morning, there were 5 fresh corpses to bury.\nThey continued, their grief was heavy, but their faith kept them strong. The mysterious figure was just a quarter mile away, his long hair blowing in the breeze. They could see the tassels at the end of his saddle, his shiny boots, and his flowing robes that were so light they could have only been made of silk. Together, they marched though the parched landscape, and at night, they found basically a rock with a hole in it large enough for 3 nuns to crawl into. The 5 set down together and decided that Mother Catherine, their eldest, Mother Abigail, their wisest, and Mother Josephine, their leader, was to remain inside. The other 2 bid their farewell and went unafraid into the darkness, strong in their faith. And when dawn broke, they were found dead.\nThe remaining three nuns, each helping each other, supporting one another, made their way across the ruined countryside. The figure was within hailing distance now, and no matter how they called, he never turned around or made any movement as if he heard anything. But still they continued, though the sun was hot and the going hard. Before long, the sun had almost set and they found themselves in front of a wooden bathroom stall, big enough for barely one non to squeeze into for the night. Mother Catherine said to Mother Josephine, long have I lived in the world, and I have tended many a man who was sick and dying, so I have no fear of death. Please, let me stay outside. Mother Abigail said, long have I pondered over the books in the Monastery, and I know the lord will have mercy on my soul if I die. You are our leader, and you deserve this chance to complete our great task, let me stay outside. So reluctantly, Mother Josephine went inside to spend the night, and in the morning, her two oldest and dearest friends were dead.\nAnd then she turned her head and the mysterious figure was right there, and she yelled at him, STOP! And he did. Mother Josephine then asked him. Are you the one who\u2019s been killing all the nuns?\nAnd he said No.\n\n(Y'all hate me don't you?)\n\n(This has been posted elsewhere on reddit but it's never been posted to r/jokes before, and it was posted like 5 years ago and I first heard it elsewhere so I just wanted to share it)",

The next day he went back to the doctor who asked how it went. The man answered, \"Not well. When I fired the pistol, my wife pooped on my face, bit three inches off my penis, and my neighbour came out of the wardrobe with his hands in the air.\"",

Now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why there was such a box and with those contents. That evening, they were out for a special anniversary dinner.\nAfter dinner, Hillary could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed, saying, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Bill. For all these years, I kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed. However, today the temptation was too much and I gave in. But now I need to know, why do you keep the 3 beer cans in the box?\u201d\n\nBill thought for a while and said, \u201cI guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you, I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again.\u201d\n\nHillary was shocked, but said, \u201cHmmm, Jennifer, Paula and Monica. I\u2019m disappointed and saddened by your behavior; however, since you are addicted to sex I guess it does happen and I guess 3 times is not that bad considering your problem.\u201d\n\nBill thanked her for being so understanding.

Do you think I could stay the night?\"\n\nThe monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.\n\nThe next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.\n\nYears later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.\n\nThe monks reply, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\"\nThe man says, \"If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.\"\n\nThe monks reply, \"You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.\"\n\nThe man sets about his task. \n\nAfter years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.\n\n\"In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.\"\n\nThe monks reply, \"Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.\"\n\nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \"The sound is beyond that door.\"\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.\n\nFinally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, \"This is the last key to the last door.\"\n\nThe man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!\nWith trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nBut, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",

I am rich, so I can get you anything you like - money is no object. What would you like for your birthday?\"\nThe son ponders this for a few seconds, then he says to his dad,\n\"I want a pink-and-purple poofy-rated ping pong ball.\"\nThe father is confused. He asks his son what that is, but his son just smirks bemusedly and replies,\n\"You will know it when you see it.\"\nThe father searches for it. He looks for it in every store around, but cannot find it, so instead he gets his son a teddy bear, and his son is happy. It still bothers him a little that he couldn't find the gift, but it was of no consequence.\n\nYears pass. Now the boy's 10th birthday is a month away. His father goes up to him and says,\n\"Son, your tenth birthday is coming soon. I am rich, so I can get you anything you like - money is no object. What would you like for your birthday?\"\nThe son thinks for a bit, then he says, \n\"Well, ever since I was little, all I ever wanted was a pink-and-purple poofy-rated ping pong ball.\"\nThe father is confused, as his son hadn't asked for that since his fifth birthday. He asks his son what that is, but his son just smiles and says, \n\"You will know it when you see it.\"\nThe father combs the internet, looking for hints as to what this thing may be. He looks through the stores as well, but to no avail. So instead, he gets his son an Xbox, and his son is happy. But that seed of doubt that was planted years ago kept growing, even if the father didn't acknowledge it. \n\nNonetheless, years pass. It is a month till the boy turns sixteen, and the father goes up to him, and says, \n\"Son, your sixteenth birthday is coming soon. I am rich, so I can get you anything you like - money is no object. What would you like for your birthday?\"\nThe son thinks for a bit, then says to his father, \n\"I remember I first asked for it when I was five, but I never got it... I've always wanted to have a pink-and-purple poofy-rated ping pong ball.\"\nThe father is frustrated. \n\"Son, I've looked for that thing every year you ask for it, and I can never find it. Can you tell me what it looks like, please?\"\nThe son shakes his head. \n\"It's not that difficult, dad. You'll recognize it when you see it.\"\nThe father goes on internet forums, asking antique toy dealers and the like if they've ever heard of this toy that his son is describing. Nobody knows what it is. Eventually the father runs out of patience and buys his son a luxury sports car instead. It's a very nice car, and his son is very happy, but now the father is doubting himself... what kind of man is he if he can't get his son exactly what he wants with all that money to throw around? He pushes the thoughts aside, and life continues.\n\nA few months pass, and one night, while the son is out with his friends, the man receives a phone call from an unknown number. The woman on the line is a stranger.\n\"Is this the residence of Mr. Smith?\"\n\"Yes, this is Mr. Smith. What is it?\"\n\"It appears that your son... Bob Smith... was involved in a car accident about an hour ago. He's on life support. I'd advise you to visit him while he still has breath in him. We're doing all we can. I'm very sorry, sir.\"\nThe man wastes no time in getting to the hospital. He is by his son's bedside within mere minutes. He looks at his son, who is in great pain, as shrapnel has been embedded all over his body from the accident. The man, knowing that his son may not live to see the next sunrise, leans on the bedside and says to his son,\n\"Son, I know I am about to lose you, I know that you will die, but let me do what I can to make your final moments the best possible. I am rich, so I can get you anything you like - money is no object. Is there anything you would like?\"\nThe son's voice is weak and choppy. \n\"Well... dad... ever since... I was... a boy... I've always... wanted to... be in possession... of a... pink-and-purple...poofy-rated...ping pong... ball... can you... get me...one...?\"\nThe man is furious. \n\"Son, you've been asking for that for years, and not one time could I find it! Please, just tell me what it is!\"\nThe son sighs, feeling his body weaken with every passing second.\n\"Okay...I'll tell you...what it...looks like...it's kind of...like a...\"\nThe boy's eyes close as the void swallows him, his words trailing off into nothingness.

I mean, who likes creepy shit like that? So one day we rented another place, packed up everything, and waited until he was all skeezed up with a needle in his arm and nodding out on the couch.\n\nThen quietly sneaked all our shit out and moved away, leaving him with an empty house.

Americans love contests, and they love winning things, so he surmised that not only would he give away one house, he\u2019d give away two!\nBeing the newly savvy marketing person he was, Mohammed contacted all the local news media that began a frenzy of news activity eliciting contest entries from far and wide.  The entry forms stacked up in his office until the day of the contest deadline arrived.  He of course masterfully invited the news media to attend the drawing, and had huge fanfare as he placed all the entries in a huge drum and began to draw the names.  Photographers\u2019 cameras flashed, TV crews filmed, and newspaper writers took notes as the first name was drawn.  \nOut came the first name:  Rhonda Mauwten, a local mother of three.  Applause from the crowd erupted as anticipation for the final name to be drawn grew.  With great fanfare, Mohammed drew the second name and announced that Shelby Colm, a local business woman, was the final winner.  \nThe contest was a huge success and the media coverage Mohammed received far out-valued the cost of the homes he gave away.

Jimmy couldn't make out much of what they were saying, but he did hear the phrase \"purple wombat\" repeated multiple times. \n\n\"But what is the purple wombat?\" Jimmy asked.\n\nOne of the boys turned to him, \"You don't know what the purple wombat is?\"\n\nJimmy was about to answer \"no\" but it was time to leave the bus and go to his first class.  In this class he again heard some kids talking about the purple wombat and again asked them what it meant.\n\n\"Jimmy, would you please come up here for a second.\" the teacher said.\n\nJimmy went up.  \"Don't you know not to talk in class?\" the teacher asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jimmy, \"but I was just asking about the purple wombat.\"\n\nWith that the teacher scolded him and sent him to the principal's office.  In there the principal asked him what was the cause of him being sent there.\n\n\"I just asked about the purple wombat!\" Jimmy exclaimed.\n\n\"That's it young man, you're going home right now!\" yelled the principal.\n\nAt home his mother was furious and demanded to know the reasons for Jimmy being sent home.\n\n\"All I did was ask about the purple wombat.\" Jimmy sobbed.\n\n\"Go to your room right now!\" ordered his mother.\n\nJimmy went to his room and stayed there for the rest of the day.  At around midnight he heard a strange sound coming from outside his window.  It was a voice.  Jimmy opened his window to hear it better.\n\n\"Jiiimmmmmmmyyyy, I am the purple wombat, come to the island on the lake tomorow night.\" said the strange yet soothing voice.\n\nJimmy was so excited, he would finally know what all the fuss was about.  The next night, Jimmy got his canoe out of the shed and brought it down to the lake next to his house.  He rowed out on the water and headed toward the small island. When he was close enough, he saw the purple wombat on the shore.  Overcome with excitement, Jimmy stood up, but accidently shook the canoe and fell overboard.\n\nMoral of the story: Don't stand up in canoes.\n\n\n",

His dad checked if he was wearing pants, which he wasn't, and said he'd put them on when he'd leave for work.\n\"No, dad!\" Timmy said desperately, \"it's my birthday today!\"\n\"Are you sure?\" his mom doubted.\n\"Of course I'm sure, jeez!!\" said Timmy frustrated, \"you guys couldn't care less, you don't even know how old i'm turning today\"\n\"Sure I do,\" was dad's confident reply, \"must be eleven by now\".\n\"Wrong\" said Timmy.\n\"Nine?\" guessed his mom.\n\"No, 10! I'm 10! It's my 10th birthday today, you idiots!\"\n\nTimmy stormed out into the adjacent living room where he found his grandma, who lived in with them, sat knitting in front of the tv.\n\"What about you, grandma?\" he asked.

She pulled down Timmy's pajama pants. She pulled down his underwear and put his tiny balls and penis in her hand. She felt him gently, pulled his foreskin, jiggled and kneaded his balls a little, seemed to weigh them, sniffed at his penis. After what felt like minutes, she pulled his underwear and pajama pants back up and turned to her knitting again.\n\"You're turning 10 today\" she said.\nTimmy stood there, flabbergasted, lost for words. \n\"Wow, grandma, how did you do that?\"\n\"I just heard you tell your parents\"",

A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.\n\nThe next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.\n\nYears later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.\n\nThe monks reply, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\"\nThe man says, \"If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.\"\n\nThe monks reply, \"You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.\"\n\nThe man sets about his task. \n\nAfter years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.\n\n\"In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.\"\n\nThe monks reply, \"Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.\"\n\nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \"The sound is beyond that door.\"\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.\n\nFinally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, \"This is the last key to the last door.\"\n\nThe man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!\nWith trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nBut, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",

Let me go find out,' and he leaves.\n\nThe couple sat and waited, and *waited*. Two months passed and the couple are still waiting. While waiting, they begin to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out; could they get a divorce in heaven?

During the tour he noticed a room marked 'life size mock ups' (in Japanese, of course, a language that the gentleman was fluent in). Hanging back a little, he waited until the rest of the group had turned a corner and slipped inside. His eyes widened as he saw full size sets of nearly the entire back catalogue of Studio Ghibli movies. He wandered around, absolutely giddy with reverence. After a couple of hours of looking, he was about to go and rejoin the tour group, when he noticed a young woman sitting on the steps of a castle with her head lowered on her knees. He decided to go and ask if she was lost, but as he got closer he noticed that she was crying. Slowing his approach to a cautious sidle, he inquired in perfect Japanese why she was crying. As she lifted her head, she removed what looked like a pair of headphones, but as they came free of her head, he saw there was only one driver. As he moved round in front of her, he saw that she was missing an ear. Trying not to make it obvious that he'd spotted her disfigurement, he asked if she was crying because her headphones were broken. \"No!\", she sobbed back at him, \"I'm locked out of my castle, with no way to unlock the door!\". \"Ah!\", said the man, \"Pleased to meet you, Princess Mononoke!\"",

He sees in the local paper that the circus is coming to a nearby town and decides that a circus would be a wonderful way to do so.\n\nHe takes his seat and first the clowns come out. One sees the old man and says, \"Hey old man! Are you a horse's head?\"\n\n\"Um... no.\" the old man replies, a little confused over such an odd question.\n\n\"Well, then you must be a horse's ass!\" The crowd bursts out laughing. The old man is devastated at the humiliation. His first day, his first interaction in decades and he gets laughed at. He tries to think of a witty comeback but try as he might he can't think of *anything* to say in response. He hangs his head in shame.\n\nThe next day he heads to the library to grab a few books on witty comebacks. He reads every one twice. He knows he's got it.\n\nHe tracks down the circus a few towns over by now. He buys a ticket, sits down, and the same clown comes out. Seeing the same old man he asks, \"Hey old man! Are you a horse's head?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I am not!\" The old man replies.\n\n\"Well, then you must be a horse's ass!\" Everyone cracks up. The old man thinks and thinks and can't come up with anything to say back! Once again, he is devastated.\n\nNow the old man enrolls himself at university, majoring in the field of witty comebacks. He studies hard and graduates top of his class. He's confident he's got it now.\n\nThe old man finds the circus again and buys a ticket. Sits down. Out come the clowns. He stares intensely at the villainous jester, who stares right back.\n\n\"Hey old man! Are you a horse's head?\"\n\n\"No, I ain't no horse's head, clown!\"\n\n\"Then you must be a horse's ass!\" The crowd laughs hysterically. The old man knows he's got this. But try as he might, he still cannot think of anything clever to say in response to this agonizing insult. A degree in witty comebacks and nothing to show for it. He's furious now, and storms out.\n\nThe old man has had enough. No way the clown is going to get him again. He buys a ticket for China. He travels to the mountains of the Orient, and studies under the Zen Masters of wit and one-liners. Spending hours, days and nights meditating on the fine art of verbal retaliations. Under a shady tree one evening, he finally achieves Nirvana in the ancient art of witty comebacks.\n\nHe heads back to the States, and once again finds that circus. He takes his seat, anticipating that it will soon be over. The clown is stunned to see him after all this time, assuming he would have given up by now. You know the question he asks...\n\n\"Hey old man! Are you a horse's head?\"\n\n\"No, I ain't no horses head!\"\n\n\"Then you must be a horse's ass!\" Everyone bursts out laughing.\n\nBut finally it's the old man's time to shine. \"HEY CLOWN!\"\n\n\"WHAT, OLD MAN!?\"\n\nThe old man clears his throat, takes a deep breath and yells \"FUUUUUUUCK YOU!\"",

At first I was thinking about how stupid that was to not use money for that transaction (and obviously slave trade= terrible) but then I started thinking about how back then most people were farmers and 20 oxen means a good number of teams to draw farm equipment and getting the work done a lot faster. But if you are in the slave trade your primary source of income would be in the selling of slaves. I guess they could liquidate their assets at any time in exchange for other services, money, or even more slaves. But it wouldn't really make sense to just be constantly flipping for more oxen cause in the end you would just have to find a way to store, feed, and protect an ever expanding oxen herd. I guess one could go the organized crime route and have a few safe houses/properties to graze/store your oxen so even if one house gets raided you still have the majority of your wealth protected. But that would mean paying a bunch of dudes/families to watch over the oxen and they probably won't accept oxen for pay. I'm hungry but I want to figure out this ox thing. *Hits bowl to push off munchies and for inspiration* score I made jello earlier. Of course I'm on here instead of reading again.

Now, who said that?\" Again, Suzuki answers: \"George Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister, 1991.\"\n\nNow furious, another student yells, \"Oh yeah? Suck my cock!\" Suzuki jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the teacher, \"Bill Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky, 1997!\"\n\nNow with almost a mob hysteria someone said, \"You little shit. If you say anything else, I'll skull-fuck your corpse.\" Suzuki frantically yells at the top of his voice, \"Gary Condit to Chandra Levy, 2001.\"\n\nAt this point, the teacher fainted, and as the class gathered around her on the floor, someone said, \"Oh shit, now we're in BIG trouble!\" Suzuki immediately screamed \"The Taliban -- September 12, 2001!\"",

He remembered the connection that it seemed to have with his bottom. He considered the experience to be sublime, perhaps even intimate. Therefore, he decided, no matter the cost, he must have that toilet. \n\nAfter drinking two bottles of pedialite and taking a few ibupeofen, he felt as though his hangover had subsided enough to return to the bar where he once met his toilet. He recognized the bartender from the night before and hastily approached him. \n\n\"Sir. This is going to sound crazy, but last night I used your establishments golden toilet. Now, I demand a price!\" \n\n\"Sir, I remember you from last night. We do not have a golden toilet. Maybe you imagined it in your stupor?\" \n\nThe man was horrified. Not because he was embarassed, but because he really needed to use that toilet. He went to find it, and went through the door to the right. Alas, the toilet was gone. He was so upset that he returned to the bar to order a drink. \n\nMeanwhile, the daytime jazz band was being introduced. The man was excited as he remembered, \"Sing, Sing, Sing!\" from his childhood.\n\nThe conductor held his arms up to prepare the band. The man took another sip off of his Bourbon. \n\nSuddenly, as the band began to play, brown lumps, chunks, and liquids exploded from the tuba. \n\nThe man had realized his mistake and quietly left New Orleans.

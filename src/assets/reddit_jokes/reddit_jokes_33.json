Looking down the list, Murphy realised that oral sex wasn't on the list & said to the woman \"wait here, I'll be right back\" & ran out of the confession box to seek advice from someone, **any**one.\n\nLooking around frantically, the only other person he could see in the church was an altar boy filling up the holy water font & Murphy ran up to him & whispered \"Hey kid, you got any idea what Father O' Sullivan used to give for oral sex?\"\n\n\"Sure\" came the reply..........\"Two Snickers bars & a can of Coke\"",

He had to pull over to relieve himself so he got out of his rig and stepped into a field. He kicked at a bush and out popped a snake. \n\nMy Grandpa was afraid of snakes and tried kicking it in an attempt to kill it until the snake shouts \"Stop!\" \n\nMy Grandpa being stunned that he's come across a talking snake backs up and starts to run away. The snake again yells \"Stop!\"\n\nGrandpa turns around and says \"I must be going crazy, You're a talking snake.\" \n\nThe snake responds saying, \"Yes, and my name is Nate.\"\n\nMy Grandpa says, \"Well I'm Richard, so who are you and what are you doing here.\"\n\nNate says, \"Well I was put here by God at the creation of the earth to protect something.\"\n\n\"Well what are you protecting.\" said My Grandpa.\n\nNate slithers over to the original bush and pushes away some of the branches to reveal a small lever sitting in the ground. \"My job is to protect this bar from being moved, because if it does the Earth will spin out of orbit and fly into the sun.\"\n\nMy Grandpa was obviously flustered and thinking he'd had a bit too much to drink decides to listen to Nate and take heed, making sure not to touch the lever. He goes to another bush and relieves himself when he gets a wonderful idea.\n\nAfter saying his good-byes to Nate and hopping back in his truck he continues his route to Los Angeles where he drops his load off and then goes to see the producers of all the top radio shows. He talks to the CEO's of NBC and CBS and convinces them to send out reporters to Nebraska to see Nate.\n\nNate gets really famous overnight. He gets interviewed on all of the news shows and gets guest spots on radio dramas, but eventually his 15 minutes of fame died down and he went back to guarding his small lever on the Nebraska plains. \n\nFast forward to just a few months ago, there was a terrible snow storm that hit Nebraska. Power was out for days and the roads were terrible. There was one driver named Carter David who had consumed just a bit too much alcohol. He got behind the wheel of his 98 Buick Skylark and started driving down some backroads he had driven hundreds of times. \n\nThis time though he hit a patch of ice and started sliding. He slid off the road and into a field. He eventually regained control of the Skylark just in time to see in front of him a bush to his left or a snake to his right. \n\nHe had to make a decision.\n\nBush.\n\nSnake.\n\nBush.\n\nSnake.\n\nQuickly he veered his car to the right and hit the snake. He got out of his car after it came to a stop to see a dead snake a few yards behind him.  The police came and so did the surrounding neighbors. One of the neighbors was in her late 80's and recognized the snake. They had become great friends after the snake became famous and identified him as Nate.\n\nMy Grandpa has been gone for about 8 years now but the authorities called our house wondering if he could come give the eulogy at Nate's funeral. I said he couldn't but because I knew the story I could come down and they said it'd be great. I gave the eulogy telling of fun times Nate had with reporters and how protective he was of his lever and ended it the way my Grandpa would've wanted me to end it.\n\nI said. \"I'm glad that Carter hit Nate. Because everyone knows that its Better Nate Than Lever.\"",

He's got Tractor wallpaper with Tractor posters, Tractor bedsheets, his shelves are covered in Tractor models and he wear a denim jacket all covered in Tractor patches. And one day this kid (let's call him Dave) is walking home from school when he spies the new Crop-Master 5000, the most advanced Tractor in the world, sitting in the field near his house.\nNaturally Dave has to take a closer look. So he breaks into the field and wanders over to the Tractor, keeping an eye out for the farmer as he does so. When he gets closer, Dave can hardly believe his eyes, this thing is beautiful, sleek and powerful with big yellow wheels and a full leather seat. Trying the door, Dave realises the cabin is open, and so he sits inside the Tractor for a little while when he realises that the key is still in the ignition!\nHardly containing himself, Dave just can't resist. He turns on the Tractor, puts it in gear, and starts trundling about. Now, I don't know if you fully understand but this is a big thing for Dave. This is like all of Dave's christmasses and birthdays all come at once.\nSo Dave is having a whale of a time when all of a sudden, out comes the Farmer! And in a thick Somerset accent he yells, \"what you doin' in there, boy! Get the hell out of my Tra'er! You can't drive that you're rubbish get out of it!\"\nDave is mortified and runs all the way home. Out of the field, down the road, round the corner and into his house. He runs past his mother, straight up to his room and falls on to his bed. Through the haze of tears after many hours of crying he eventually gets up and sees the Crop-Master 5000 poster opposite his bed... \"Nothing will make me feel like that again!\" he cries, \"I'll make sure of it!\" and he tears the poster off the wall. In a fit of rage he destroys every last piece of Tractor memorabilia he owns, even down to tearing the patches off his favorite denim jacket. Dave then becomes a recluse, and, save for school, doesn't leave his room for over seven years.\nEventually his mother has had enough and she goes to Dave to talk some sense in to him. \"Dave\" she says, \"I know you're still upset about what happened with the farmer, but he's apologised and you need to move on with your life. Please, for me, and for your father. Go out, find some friends, get a job, just do something. Please?\"\nSo, wanting to make his mother happy, Dave pulls on his old denim jacket, which, by now is way too small and full of holes. And he walks to the pub.\nWhen he gets there, he pushes the door open and is immediately greeted by a thick waft of Cigarette smoke. Coughing, he wanders up to the bar. \"Pint of lager please.\" \"Ay lad.\" Dave sits and, struggling to get comfortable on the rickety old stool, surveys his surroundings. The barman brings him his drink and Dave pays for it, then, after taking a swig. He lets out a sigh, and all the smoke in the room clears.\nThe barman is startled, to say the least. \"What on earth was that?!\" \"What?\" replies Dave. \"The smoke! It all just vanished!\" \"Oh\" chuckles Dave, \"I'm an ex Tractor fan.\"",

He was known as a hard man with few weaknesses and, being such, he had little patience for weakness in others. He was getting past middle age and had accomplished all of the goals that he had set for himself, so he decided to find a woman with whom he could share the fruits of his labor and who could be a companion to him in his twilight years. But being the rugged frontier, the only unattached women were soiled doves of ill repute. It was unacceptable for a man of his social standing to marry a whore, so he did what men of his day did in his situation - he wrote back east for a mail order bride.  After months of correspondence with several different women he finally settled on one that suited him. He sent her a marriage proposal and she sent back her acceptance. They set a date and she boarded a train. He met her at the train station upon her arrival where they introduced themselves and exchanged pleasantries. Having become briefly acquainted, they walked across to the Justice of the Peace and were quickly married while the porter loaded the woman's luggage into the rancher's wagon. The newlyweds then left town and headed to the ranch on a particularly hot day in June. A few miles outside of town, the horse pulling the wagon swayed a bit and then stumbled. The rancher pulled up on the reigns, hopped down from the wagon, walked in front of the horse, and stared hard into its eyes for a moment before raising a solitary finger and saying in a firm tone \"THAT'S ONCE.\" He got back into the wagon and headed off again. They had gone only a mile further when the horse swayed and stumbled again. Once again the old rancher jumped down from the wagon, approached the horse, and stared hard into its eyes before raising two fingers and admonishing the horse \"THAT'S TWICE.\" He climbed back into the wagon, snapped the reigns and headed off towards the ranch. The horse did well for the next three or four miles but then fatigue and the unrelenting heat got the better of him and he swayed yet again, stumbled mightily, almost fell, and nearly caused the wagon to tip over. The rancher, noticeably agitated now, said through gritted teeth \"DAMMIT, THAT'S THREE TIMES!\" He reached under the seat of the wagon, pulled out a shotgun, walked up to the horse, put the barrel up to its head and pulled the trigger, dropping the animal stone dead on the ground. The woman was aghast at witnessing such a thing and exclaimed \"WHY did you do THAT?!\" The rancher said \"Honey, that horse weren't no good, but don't you worry your pretty little head none, it's not even five miles to the ranch from here, we can just walk the rest of the way and I can carry most of the luggage.\" His new bride was unsatisfied with this answer and began to loudly voice her displeasure - \"Five Miles! In this heat!?! I'm wearing a brand new dress! How could you be so inconsiderate?! She went on and on. The rancher stood there and listened to her until she had finished browbeating him.

According to a White House insider, President Obama learned about the IRS scandal by watching TV news. As shocking as that may seem, it's not near as bad when you learn Biden only found out and understood the scandal once Obama reenacted what he saw on the news with sock puppets.\n\nLet's back off the heavy stuff and break into some fun (Reddit-friendly) news. Following in the footsteps of \"Uggie\", a cat is now the breakout star of the Cannes film festival. The cat won over audiences with his brave performance in the upcoming summer thriller, \"Terminator 5: Rise of the Laser Pointers\".\n\nMore entertainment news, Kanye West revealed his new album is titled \"Yeezus\". Reminding us all of that crucial Bible verse where Jesus told his disciples, \"Now, I ain't sayin' she's a frankincense-fracker, but she ain't messin' with no broke Messianic cr*cker.\"\n\nThis is a strange story, a new study has discovered that brain shock therapy can boost math skill. So, if you're still afraid of math, don't worry, just let us glue some large electrodes to your face...\n\nSome funny news. Just today, the Pope admitted he occasionally sleeps during mass - and sometimes if he's feeling extra lazy and doesn't even want to show up, he'll just call in possessed.\n\nThat is it for now but I'll come back if anything else good pops up today.

Sometimes I hack your phone just so I can hear the sound of your voice\".\n\nMore Obama criticism, President Obama caused a stir when he required two marines to hold his umbrella for him during a particularly stormy press conference. Even worse later that day when Biden had three marines check under his bed for thunder monsters.\n\nPseudo-political, a recent study found that men with bigger biceps tended to side with the GOP on fiscal policy - mainly because it's hard not to get buff when you just wrote out 35,000 tax loopholes on a single bill.\n\nIt's time to get out of politics!

You have to read the whole thing in order to fully comprehend the joke.**\n\n\nThe scotch wasn\u2019t going down easily today, but that didn\u2019t make pouring some more any more difficult for Adam. The phone call he had received three days earlier kept replaying in his mind over and over again.\n\nShe was out of town for a press conference. \u201cI can\u2019t not go, honey. I was the lead designer for the prototype. Who else is going to announce and describe its features?\u201d \n\nAdam never became too involved in Alexa\u2019s career. He was supportive, but the amount of time she spent away from home was anything but enjoyable for Adam.\n\n Adam was a retired homicide investigator, though his retirement was earlier than he\u2019d have preferred. He\u2019d known it would happen if he kept pursuing the case, but a double homicide on two children under the age of 10 was too much for Adam to just \u201clet go.\u201d During his investigation, he got in a bad way with some worse people and became too much of a liability for the department. Retirement was the only option. \n\nThe phone call though\u2026 the phone call changed everything. Alexa\u2019s assistant was in tears as she told him. Adam couldn\u2019t suppress his despair when he found out his beloved wife was found with a gun in her hand and a bullet through her head in the company paid hotel suite: Suite 103. \n\nAdam was waiting. He was told that his arrest was inevitable if he interfered with the investigation. That wouldn\u2019t stop him from conducting his own once the unmotivated machine-men finished lazily going through their procedures. \n\n\nHe arrived the next day at the hotel, and his hangover disappeared as soon as he walked through the doors. The hotel manager seemed to be giving him looks of disapproval as soon as he walked through the door, so unsurprisingly, he refused to allow Adam into Suite 103 since the investigation was over and had already deemed the death a suicide. \n\n\nAdam knew Alexa better than that. This wasn\u2019t a suicide no matter what the investigation seemed to reveal, and no bitter hotel manager with a big nose and a bigger stick up his ass would keep Adam from finding out what really happened in that hotel suite.\n\n Adam headed into a maintenance hallway and began watching the workers. They seemed to still be talking about the incident in Suite 103. Adam noticed one girl in particular: a blonde, around 22 years of age who he knew would have a wonderful smile if she allowed one to occupy her face. A smile seemed out of the question for her, though. She seemed to feel more uncomfortable talking about the \u201csuicide\u201d than the other workers, and upon learning she worked with the housekeeping staff, Adam knew she was his way in. \n\n\nHe waited for her to enter the restroom and seated himself close enough for her to notice him when she walked out, but far enough away to be covert about it. Thinking about Alexa was all Adam needed for tears to begin streaming down his face. The blonde exited the restroom and stared at him for a bit before approaching him. \n\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d whispered the girl. \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had better days.\u201d Stuttered Adam.\n\nWhile explaining his situation, Adam learned the girl\u2019s name was Alex\u2014a convenient coincidence as far as Adam was concerned. Alex had tears glistening in her eyes by the time Adam was finished, and it was not difficult to convince her to help him.\n\n\nThere were three conditions Adam had to follow if he wanted to have access to Suite 103: \n\n1. He had to make his own copy of the key to the room. \n\n2. Alex\u2019s involvement in helping him had to remain a secret no matter what. \n\n3. Adam had to only access the suite at evenfall for around half an hour each day, as that was the latest time he could enter without seeming suspicious, and shift changes of security personnel lasted around that long. \n\nAdam\u2019s first day in the suite didn\u2019t yield much. He noticed the bullet hole in the wall didn\u2019t make much sense with what he expected based on evidence from Alexa\u2019s head, but that was all speculation since Adam didn\u2019t get to observe the initial investigation.\n\n\nOver a period of nine days, Adam visited Suite 103 each day for a half hour. He noticed nothing that the investigation hadn\u2019t already revealed. He went home on day nine and thought that maybe he didn\u2019t know his wife as well as he thought he did. He tried to convince himself that his efforts weren\u2019t all for naught, but nothing seemed to support that idea. \n\n\nAs he was drowning in those depressing thoughts, he realized that there was one thing he hadn\u2019t looked at. Investigators avoid searching sheets and any other form of fabric for fingerprints because the material does not hold the prints like a glossy and hard surface does; however, that hotel room had a blanket over the comforter on the bed that was mainly there for aesthetic appeal. This blanket had some sort of glossy coating on it from what Adam had observed when he removed it from the bed on day one. If there were one place from which someone wouldn\u2019t think to clean their fingerprints, that place would be on a blanket. \n\n\nAdam couldn\u2019t wait for the next night. He grabbed his supplies for revealing prints and his key to the suite and rushed back to the hotel. He hurried through the doors and saw Alex whose eyes widened upon seeing him. She vigorously shook her head, but Adam ignored it and jogged to the suite, opening the door and entering. He began applying a powdery residue to the glossy blanket. \n\n\nThe door swung open and the hotel manager\u2019s silhouette came into view on the mirror in front of the door. \n\n\n\u201cGET OUT!\u201d he screamed. \n\n\nAdam knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to reason with the hotel manager, so he just kept searching the blanket for fingerprints. Adam worked through the hotel manager calling the police and worked through the hotel manager\u2019s constant screaming. Sure enough, the blanket was covered in prints. Prints from multiple people. Prints from more people than were involved in his wife\u2019s death, but Adam knew that some of them belonged to her killer. \n\n\nSeconds after this revelation, Adam\u2019s arm was grasped firmly and he was handcuffed and brought to his feet. \n\n\n\u201cNO! My wife was killed! Murdered! The killer\u2019s prints are on that sheet! I know it!\u201d \n\n\nThe officers would not listen and they led Adam to the doorway. Adam walked away from his life and left his heart on that blanket. As the hotel room door closed, Adam turned back toward the room as a single tear streamed down his cheek. Emotion overwhelmed his voice as he opened his mouth and whispered, \u201cGood night, suite prints.\u201d",

Once more, the cowboy whispers in the horses ear and it takes off in the distance. 3 hours later, and just as the natives were about to give up and kill the man right then and there, a figure appears riding towards them in the distance. Another woman, this one even more beautiful than the last! She rode in and dismounted the horse and took the cowboys hand to lead him into a tent. The cowboy sighs with exhaustion and follows her and badabing badaboom emerges a while later wiping sweat from his brow.\n\nThe natives are extremely impressed, but they know they still have to kill the man. So they decide that they will grant the man one last dying wish, mostly because they want to see if he can pull this off again. The cowboy says, \"I'd like to speak with my horse.\"\n\nThis time, the cowboy approaches the horse and grabs both of its ears. Staring it hard in the eyes he says very loudly and clearly and with much exasperation, \"Posse!! Get my posse!\"\n\nEdit: yea posted on my phone, thanks for catching that haha. Words are fixed.",

He is disqualified and receives no points.\n\nAfter the race, the owner approaches the bulldog, he's surprised, amazed and angry at the same time and asks:  \n\"What the hell happened, bulldog!?\" - bulldog just looks at him and says:  \n\"Shit, I don't know.\"",

In a quick response to the rumor, President Obama has appointed a new consul to North Korea, Ambassador Maury.\n\nMore on the international front, David Beckham has announced his retirement. Beckham says he's going to take the time to wind down and chase his true passion, spinning soccer balls on his beautifully chiseled nips.\n\nLove this guy, Hugh Hefner has just bought his wife her own house. The house comes with a redone master bedroom equipped with a queen bed for his wife and a pull-out casket for Hef.\n\nCan't leave this out, Obama has named a new IRS chief. Obama says the new guy has all the right stuff. He's great with numbers, even better with people, and no ink allergy so he can swallow any evidence.\n\nMore political news, Obama says he has \"no apologies\" over the AP scandal. And keeping with the administration's attitude, Biden also offered no apologies when he farted on FLOTUS while she sniffed flowers in the White House Rose Garden.\n\nThis is kind of strange, a group of psychologists have found that kids today are wimpier than those in the past. But you could already tell based on the new top-selling sanitized kids' book, \"Clifford the Sensibly-Sized Hypoallergenic Maltese on Ambien\".\n\nWe've already seen this on Reddit but it finally hit the news. A mysterious, oozing, puke-like puddle has reportedly been spewing from a sewer manhole in China.

I owe a lot to the community of /r/jokes in helping boost my confidence.\n\nOn with the jokes!\n\n**1**) O.J. is back again. O.J. says he wants ANOTHER trial to correct issues from his LAST trial. And rumor has it, if he goes to court just two more times, his punchcard coupon is filled and he gets the 2nd glove 50% off.\n\nThat was a little dark.\n\n**2**) Let's move on. Lighter news. A man was caught trespassing while swimming on Taylor Swift's beachfront property. That man turned out to be Taylor's latest ex trying to swim to Cuba's state-controlled radio before her next song dropped.\n\n**3**) More fluff, more fluff. James Franco has announced he is going to star in a movie based on a William Faulkner novel. Sources say the movie is about a trapped high schooler who spends 127 hours trying to understand any part of \"The Sound and the Fury\".\n\nNo more waffle taco jokes for now but we do have a new product on the horizon...\n\n**4**) It looks like Burger King is working on a McRib rival product. But don't worry, McDonald's said it won't stand for any competition so they scoured their leftover cow parts to come up with the brand new hit sandwich, \"The McPubis Cartilage\"!\n\n**5**) Strange story. It seems like LinkedIn is having issues with prostitutes making profiles. However, you can usually tell when it's a LinkedIn hooker because her goal statements are usually \"To go up on the corporate ladder\" and \"To go down on your sweet corporate pole\".\n\nOkay, we're down to just a couple more. Can you take it?\n\n**6**) TMZ reports that Kanye's Lamborghini recently got stuck in Kim Kardashian's driveway gate. Kanye said he would've folded in the mirrors but he just f-cking loved looking at his own face.\n\n**7**) A sweet story. A little Wisconsin boy got a handwritten (you hear that? HANDWRITTEN) response from Joe Biden himself from a note he sent regarding gun control. It was tough to tell what was cuter, the boy's suggestion for guns that fired chocolate instead of bullets or the fact that Biden still confuses his q's and p's.\n\nOkay, end scene. Those of you who have read these. I give you my sincere thanks. I read the jokes you post too (even when they're puns) and I enjoy them mightily!

One day he finally got fed up with his repetitive, insignificant life and decided that he would leave his hive, his family, his entire close-knit wasp community and he would go out into the world and make something of himself, just like the humans do. So the wasp enrolls in school, and passes with flying colors. Remember, this is a very smart wasp. He gets his high school diploma in a little under 3 years, with a 4.0 GPA and all that snazz. After high school, believe it or not, the wasp gets accepted to Harvard. Harvard! This too proves to be no challenge for our hero, as he graduates in just two years, again a 4.0, on the Dean's list, and all that snazz. Not to mention all the clubs and sports he was in-the newspaper, rowing, student government-and the fact that he was by far the most popular student on campus. Even his professors looked up to him. \nHe goes on to get two PhDs, and when he finishes his education, the wasp faces a bit of a dilemma. How does he apply his knowledge now? Where does he go from here? He decides to try out politics. After all, he was popular throughout school, did well in Harvard government. So he runs for mayor, and wins in a landslide. He greatly reforms the city, fixing virtually all its major problems. He runs for governor and again wins in a landslide. Two years later, the presidential election was coming up, and the wasp decides he might as well go for it. \nOf course, he wins in the largest landslide in US presidential history. His presidency goes exceedingly well-he is loved by all parties, and has the highest approval ratings in history. He also finds the cures for cancer, AIDS, and broken hearts while in the White House. After 8 years (yes, of course he was reelected) the time has come for him to leave his office. Even his successor his saddened by the wasp\u2019s departure, but they all know it\u2019s what must be done. Back at his vacation home in California his first day after leaving office, the wasp looks back on his long and fruitful life. He realizes that he hasn't been back to his hive at all since that first day he left. He suddenly feels a twang of guilt as he realizes how much he misses his parents and his little brother. So he heads back to the hive, looking more worn out than he remembers. He goes inside and greets his family, who are overjoyed at the sight of him. He talks about how his life has gone as his family listens in wonderment. Eventually he decides he is thirsty, so he decides to visit the old watering hole he remembered. Once he gets there though, there\u2019s an extremely long line. He decides it\u2019s worth the wait, so gets in line. One hour. Two hours. This is the slowest moving line he\u2019s ever seen! Eventually he calculates that it could be a few days before he gets to the front of the line, so decides it\u2019s not worth it. He decides to go get some cider to drink instead, but waddya know, another huge line of people waiting for cider! He remembers one other drinking area that never had a long line-fruit punch! So he decides to go get punch. He arrives, and lo and behold, there's no punch line.\"\n\nAll credit goes to http://anti-joke.com/anti-joke/random/33510-so-there-once-was-this-wasp-that-lived-in-a-jungle-this-was-not-your-ordinary-wasp-though-he-was-smart. \n",

Not to be outdone, Sen. Rubio has started hydrating three years in advance using a Big Gulp filled with Paul Ryan's Pilates sweat.\n\nWeird biology news. A rare, six-foot flower that smells like rotting corpses has bloomed in an Ohio conservatory. Hallmark is already selling a bouquet of these giant corpse flowers for Mother-in-Law's Day.\n\nGotta bring this up. There was a major press breach where US officials seized two months of phone records from journalists. Panic over the breach died when it was found to just be Biden trying to get someone to explain last week's \"Doonesbury\" to him.\n\nA lighter story, Willie Nelson has been granted an honorary degree from Berklee College of Music. Berklee gave him the degree credit upon finding he had finally smoked as much pot as a senior reggae student.\n\nI still love this story. Taco Bell is now coming out with a waffle taco. The taco comes with sides of both Aunt Jemima's syrup and Mrs. Butterworth's donated bile to aid in digestion.\n\nGosh, I dislike Madonna. Here we go. Madonna recently sold her self-crafted painting for $7 million. Critics say the painting\u2019s turbulent brush strokes evoke both the struggles of mankind to ascend beyond rationality and the struggles of Madonna\u2019s boobs to ascend beyond her bellybutton.\n\nAnother old joke. Because, who cares? Paul McCartney revealed a rare Beatles track during a concert. The track is a tune he just wrote at the ripe old age of 70 called \"Norwegian Wood (This Scandinavian Viagra Actually Works)\".\n\nNot many tonight but I'd rather you have a few zingers than a bunch of K.O.'d punch-lines.\n\nOnce again, the feed is all here, https://twitter.com/TopTopical.

So I'm sitting there in my empty house, realizing my life has come down around me, and I say, right here, 'Screw this, I make my own luck' and I decide to drive to Vegas and bet away whatever is left in my bank account before my soon to be ex-wife empties it out.\"\n\n\"So I pull into the Bellagio's parking lot, and, okay, this is going to sound silly, but it happened right, there's this frog. Just sitting there, in the parking lot. I figured maybe a kid dropped it or something, who knows. I was about to ignore it when suddenly I heard 'rib-bit! pick me up!' I stopped and turned to look at it and again \"rib-bit! take me with you!\" So, im weirded the hell out. It's a goddamn talking frog. I thought I was going crazy, but hell, maybe I was,  I was already in Vegas to blow away everything I had left in the world, so I picked up the frog, put it in my pocket, and walked into the casino to try and enjoy myself.\"\n\n\"Now right when I walked past the roulette table, the frog yells out 'rib-bet! black 21!' I stop for a second, realizing my sanity is barely hanging on, and it says it again 'rib-bit! Black 21!\" Okay, what have I got to lose, the frog seems to think Black 21 was a good bet, and it is a talking frog right? So I put my all the cash in my wallet on Black 21. And son of a bitch, I won!. And here's the thing, this goes on all night. the damn frog calls out numbers at the roulette table, when to hit and stay at black jack, and I can't lose! I made so much money, I take my winnings, and decide to rent the nicest suite in the whole hotel for the night.\"\n\n\"So I get up to my room, the penthouse, put the frog on the bed, cause, hell, he earned it for all the help right, and walk to the window to stare at the city. then suddenly 'Rib-bit! Kiss me!' I turned, and said 'huh, what?' and the frog said it again 'rib-bit! kiss me!' Okay, so the talking frog I found which somehow helped me magically win at gambling all night wanted me to kiss it. You know, I guess I owed it that much, one little kiss as gratitude. So I bend over, give it a light kiss on the bed, and BAM! the frog turns into a beautiful 15 year old girl, just lying there in the bed!\"\n\n\"So anyway, thats how she ended up in my room your Honor.\"",

Burp)\n\nAs a refresher, Taco Bell did announce it yesterday was going to make a new waffle taco. However, the Taco Bell CEO advises you eat the waffle taco for breakfast so your family has the rest of the day to set up and host your funeral.\n\nVice President Biden made a speech to college grads telling them to avoid cynics. Biden advised the graduates, \"Say no to nay-sayers. You CAN stick your whole fist in your mouth. Believe me. I've done it.\"\n\nBig entertainment news. FOX is now planning to bring back \"24\". Of course, at Kiefer Sutherland's age, the show is now called \"23 Plus Sitting Down for 'Murder, She Wrote' at 7\".\n\n(Scattered Applause. Man coughs)\n\nUm, In case you missed it, International Clitoris Week has just ended. I think it's appropriate that at the end of the Week, we take a moment of silence to honor all the brave men who sacrificed life and limb going down on Paris Hilton.\n\nVery strange story, Mel Gibson told reporters he is a Tom Jones fan - and to make sure this racist Gibson lunatic stops listening his music, Tom Jones has just released \"What's New Zion Lion?\". \n\nThe FBI recently raided an FBI student for making rice in a pressure cooker. You should have seen how tense it got when the student said he could really make the rice explode with some spicy Sriracha.\n\nThat's all for today, folks.

Just push and it will be over quickly.\"\nSo he starts pushing and sure enough out pops an egg. \"Wow! That wasn't so bad.\" But the pain returns. Again, he turns to a chicken, \"The pain is back. Are you sure there's nothing wrong?\"\nThe chicken says, \"Well, you're a chicken and chicken's don't usually lay just one egg. Just push and it will be over quickly.\"\nSo again he starts pushing and sure enough out pops another egg. \"I think I got the hang of this being a chicken thing.\" Seconds later the pain returns and being prepared for it he starts pushing but the egg isn't coming out as easy this time. He pushes harder. Still nothing. Harder.\nSuddenly his wife smacks him in the chest, \"Wake up asshole! You're shitting in the bed again!\"",

You've got a lot of nerve coming back in here.\"\n\nThe panda eats a few more nuts and stares blankly at the bartender.\n\nThe bartender yells, \"Well don't you have anything to say for yourself?!?\"\n\nThe panda stands up and says, \"What can I say? I'm a panda. Look it up.\" Pulls out and AK-47, kills everyone but the bartender, and out the door he goes.\n\nThe bartender is beside himself, but the panda has piqued his curiosity. He goes and gets an encyclopedia. He opens to the entry on pandas and reads: Panda: Mammal. Eats Shoots and Leaves.\n\nEdit for spelling",

He prayed.\n\n\"Oh Mary! Please help me in my time of confusion, what should I do? Do I buy my shoes and pursue my dreams, or do I buy the tickets, and uphold my friendship?

Just as he was about to turn the corner out of the corridor to leave through the foyer, he overheard the boy, loud and pious in prayer. Being the cheeky sort, he droned aloud as solemnly as he could.\n\n\"Buy the tickets~ Buy the tickets~\"\n\nThe boy seemingly having heard this, opened his eyes and looked up in shock, then he went back into prayer and repeated.\n\n\"Oh Mary!

The agent tells him \"I think you'll need to change your name or use a stage name, no one will hire you with a name like Penis van Lesbian.\" Mr. Lesbian is quite perturbed and says he'll think about it.\n\nThe next day, he comes back. He tells the agent that he decided to change his name so that he could act, even though he liked his name and was quite attached to it. The producer asks him what his new name is, and he responds.\n\n\"Dick van Dyke\"",

I need you to go visit our client in the Himalayas, they want to put a face to their product and you are just the man for the job.\"\n\"The Himalayas? Wow, I would love to.\" He said.\nSo the next day Joe boards a plane to Nepal, and he arrives with a few days to spare. So he decides to go on a hike up the mountain, so he goes to this little shop to get some supplies and rent a pack mule. Little did he know that a storm was forming and would soon be upon him. He starts north ready for a beautiful hike in the Himalayan mountains. His first day goes off without a hitch, Joe makes it about 16 miles along the trail and sets up camp just off the main trail. The next day he wakes up to a brutal blizzard, it is impossible to see more than a few feet and the trail is mostly covered. He tries to make his way back but ends up getting off the trail unknowingly, heading deeper and deeper into uncharted territory. Finally he gives up and sets up camp again. The storm rages for 3 days, he missed his meeting, however that was the least of his concerns. When he finally emerges from his tent he realizes that he is completely lost. Most of his gear is gone and he doesn't know how he can make it back to town. Nevertheless he sets out, he hikes on for days with little hope of refuge. When all of a sudden he comes across a building, he immediately heads inside, to discover that it is a bakery, he asks the owner for a slice of his best pie and directions to town. The baker says his best pie is called Himalayan peach pie. Joe sits down and tries a bite, it is the most wonderfully marvelous slice of pie he had ever had in his life. He asks for a second slice, and a third, and even a fourth. When he left he took 4 pies with him. He found the town and managed to make his way home. When he got back to work he was fired for failing the client, when he explained the situation his boss felt sorry for him but could not do anything about his job. So he goes home. The situation he was in made him realize how good life is, so he calls his old girlfriend and asks to meet up with her for coffee. When she gets there he tells her about what happened to him and explains how he regrets breaking up with her. They end up dating for 9 months and after that, he proposes to her. She says yes, they have a magical wedding and for their honeymoon they decide to search for the little bakery that sells the magical pie. So they set out to Nepal, when they arrive they go to the same supply shop that Joe went to before and ask the man about the bakery. He had a general idea of where the shop was a circled the area on a map for them. They head out in search of the bakery. For 8 long days they searched, and had no success. On the 9th day Joe and his new wife are crossing a narrow snow-bridge when suddenly the bridge gives out and Joe's wife falls to her death. Horrified, Joe sets up camp and calls out to his wife hoping against hope that she was alive. He does this for 5 days, when he gives up he decides to just walk off into the distance until he cannot walk any further. He walks for 2 whole days and 1 night when all of a sudden he comes across the bakery. When he walks in there is a different man behind the counter. It turns out the man had a son who was now in charge of the bakery and had been dead for several months. He asks the mans son if he has the Himalayan peach pie, unfortunately the man never wrote the recipe out and no one knew how to make it. It was the last straw. Joe asks the man's son if he can search for the recipe and explains what he went through to get there. The man's son lets him look but warns him it would be futile. after 2 days of non-stop searching he gives up, the man's son says to him, \"we also have apple.\"\n\nJoe thinks for a while and says, \"Ok I'll have apple.\" ",

What beautiful animals!\", he said to himself. As he was walking along the river, he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. When he turned to see what the cause was, he saw a 7-foot grizzly charging right towards him. He ran as fast as he could. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing, He ran even faster, crying in fear. He looked over his shoulder again, and the bear was even closer. His heart was pounding and he tried to run even faster. He tripped and fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up, but saw the bear right on top of him, reaching for him with his left paw and raising his right paw to strike him.\n\nAt that moment, the Atheist cried out \"Oh my God!....\" Time stopped. The bear froze. The forest was silent. Even the river stopped moving.\n\nAs a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky, \"You deny my existence for all of these years; teach others I don''''t exist; and even credit creation to a cosmic accident. Do you expect me to help you out of this predicament? Am I to count you as a believer?\"\n\nThe atheist looked directly into the light \"It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask You to treat me as Christian now, but perhaps could you make the bear a Christian?\" \"Very well,\" said the voice.\n\nThe light went out. The river ran again. And the sounds of the forest resumed.\n\nAnd then the bear dropped his right paw ..... brought both paws together...bowed his head and spoke: \"Lord, for this food which I am about to receive, I am truly thankful.\"",

After a week went by she was getting horny, so she stuck her hand down her pants and starting fapping on the couch.  She tried to get off but just could not with her hand.   Frustrated and unable to sleep she decided to go the the local sex shop and find a dildo.  She browsed and found a medium sized dildo and figured it would work perfectly.  \n\nSo she goes home and tries it out.   After 20 minutes go by she is still not getting into it and is left even more frustrated.   By this time it is getting late and she is unable to sleep.  determined she heads back to the sex shop and finds a new dildo.   She then gets the rabbit dildo.  \n\nShe gets home after purchasing the rabbit and immediately tries it.  She notices an improvement, but damn it is still not working for her.  Desperate she heads back to the sex shop,  by this time one of the employees notices that she has been in multiple times in the past 4 hours.  He asks if he can help.  She explains that nothing is working for her.....   The employee nods and says,  I think I might have something that will help you.  The sex store employee says, \"Voodoo dildo my hand\"  a dildo then shoots off the wall and starts pumping up and down in his hand.   He explains to her that this is a special dildo from the south and that it has voodoo magic.   All that you have to say is \"Voodoo dildo\" then where you want it to go. To get it to Stop you just Say Voodoo dildo stop\"  \nShe is sold!   She buys it immediately.   As she gets in here car she cannot wait to get home so she just busts it out in the car and decides she will have a session while she is driving.\n\nAs she is driving she says \"Voodoo dildo my pussy\" and immediately the dildo pops up and starts thrusting in her.   She is taken back by the intensity and she begins to feel the rush of an orgasm, she soon has one and then 2 orgasm's.  As she is driving she is moaning loud now as she is driving and swerving all over the road late at night, just when the bars are closing down.  As she is having her third orgasm she sees Red and blue lights behind her and soon realizes she is being pulled over.  \n\nSo she pulls over and she is reaching her 4th orgasm and is shaking and unable to tell the dildo to stop.   The police officer approaches the window and asks the woman if she has been drinking.   She mumbles in ecstasy as she is reaching her 5th orgasm shaking and she mumbles she has a voo........doooooooooooooo......   Dil......doooo caaannnn't stoooooooooooppppppppppp. \n\nThe police officer looks confused and says \"Voodoo Dildo my ass lady\"",

The Pope then decided,\n\n\"So be it. Send to me your greatest scholar, and we will have a religious debate. If he can beat me, then you all can stay.\"\n\nThe Jews nominated Rabbi Moshe to represent them. Although he was aged, he was also one of their wisest. However, he spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Yiddish, so they had a silent debate. There must have been thousands watching.\n\nFirst, the Pope held up three fingers. Rabbi Moshe responded by holding up one. Then, the Pope waved one of his fingers around his head. Rabbi Moshe then pointed straight to the ground. Then the Pope brought out a Communion wafer and a chalice of wine. Rabbi Moshe pulled out an apple. The Pope then admitted defeat, saying that the rabbi was too clever and had beaten him. There was much rejoicing among the Jews in Italy.\n\nLater, the Cardinals met with the Pope and asked him, \"We don't understand. What happened in that debate?\"\n\nThe Pope responded, \"First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity, but Rabbi Moshe held up one to show that there was still one God common to both our religions. Then I waved my finger around to show that God was all around us, but he pointed to the ground to remind me that he was also right there with us. Then I held out the wafer and wine to show that God absolved us of all sins. He then pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He had me beaten and I could not continue.\"\n\nAround the same time, some members of the Jewish community asked Rabbi Moshe how he won the debate. \"I really don't know,\" he said. \"First he put up three fingers showing that we had three days to leave Italy, and so I gave him the finger. Then he waved his finger around, proclaiming that all of Italy will be rid of us, so I motioned that we're staying right here. Then he took out his lunch so I took out mine.\"\n\nEDIT: grammar, spelling.",

Then, a louder knock follows.\n\n\"Aren't you going to answer that?\" says his wife. So he drags himself out of bed and goes downstairs. He opens the door and there is a man standing at the door. It didn't take the homeowner long to realize the man was drunk.\n\n\"Hi there,\" slurs the stranger. \"Can you give me a push??\" \"No, get lost. It's half past three. I was in bed,\" says the man and slams the door. He goes back up to bed and tells his wife what happened and she says, \"Dave, that wasn't very nice of you. Remember that night we broke down in the pouring rain on the way to pick the kids up from the baby sitter and you had to knock on that man's house to get us started again? What would have happened if he'd told us to get lost??\"\n\n\"But the guy was drunk,\" says the husband.\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" says the wife. \"He needs our help and it would be the right thing to help him.\" So the husband gets out of bed again, gets dressed and goes downstairs. He opens the door, and not being able to see the stranger anywhere he shouts, \"Hey, do you still want a push??\" And he hears a voice cry out, \"Yeah, please.\"\n\nSo, still being unable to see the stranger he shouts, \"Where are you?\" And the stranger replies, \"I'm over here, on your swing.\"",

Fastforward to Lent when the preist sees Paul coming out of a butcher shop with a bag of beef, so in order not to embarress Paul, the preist decides to talk with Paul after Lent so he can explain to the preist why he was coming out of the butcher's shop with beef in his hand. So Lent passes and the preist tells Paul he saw him come out of the butcher's shop, Paul responds by saying \"Father Henry, you have it all wrong, you see after I bought the beef I went straight home and dip the beef in water while saying: this is not meat, it's fish, it's not meat it's fish, so technicallly I didn't sin!!\"",

There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.\n\nI felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn\u2019t know what else to do, so I started to play.\n\nThe workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I\u2019ve never played before for this homeless man.\n\nAnd as I played \u2018Amazing Grace,\u2019 the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my guitar and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.\n\nAs I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, \u201cI never seen nothin\u2019 like that before and I\u2019ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.\u201d",

So they did, and I tell ya, they turned it on: 5 star restaurants, front row seats to Celine Dion, helicopter trips over the strip; it was magnificent.

At breakfast the next morning after the ladies were gone, his buddy was the first one to break the ice. \"How did it go last night?\" he says. \"Not good,\" his friend replied \"had too much to drink and couldn't perform, but from the sound of it you sure had a good time!\" His friend cast his eyes down, ashamed and said, \"Man, I couldn't even get up on the bed!\" ",

Somewhat surprised, Jenny consents for more coupling. When the newlyweds are done, Roger kisses his bride, bids her a fond good night and leaves. \n\nShe is set to go to sleep again, but, aha, you guessed it - Roger is back again, rapping on the door and is as fresh as a 25-year-old, ready for more 'action'.

I have been with guys less than a third of your age who were only good once. You are truly a great lover, Roger.' \n\nRoger, somewhat embarrassed, turns to Jenny and says: 'You mean I've been here already tonight?'",

So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today.\n\nMost of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.\n\nThis gives two possibilities:\n\n\n\n1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.\n\n\n\n2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell,then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.\n\n\n\nSo which is it?\n\n\n\nIf we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that, \"It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,\" and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct......leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, Teresa kept shouting \"Oh my God.\"",

Well, I decided that I'd try to climb down but after a few, I figured 7 more would be too much.

Ok, fine, it was a brown bear... no wait... that still won\u2019t work. Polar bear? Maybe a grizzly bear, though, I guess technically that\u2019s still brown. You know what, it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s not important to the joke. You just make it whatever kind of bear you want. It could be a grizzly bear, polar bear, koala bear, it doesn\u2019t matter. This is now strictly between you, your bear and your morals.\n\nSo this BEAR walks into a restaurant and a bunch of the patrons are all really uneasy because a bear just walked in. One of the patrons actually jumps up and runs from the restaurant screaming. No wait. That wouldn\u2019t make sense if it was a koala bear. Unless that guy had some traumatizing experience with a koala bear when he was a child or something. So fine, it can be whatever kind of bear you want, but not a koala bear, or it could be a koala bear if the guy who ran off had a traumatic koala bear accident as a child. Regardless the guy who ran off isn\u2019t important to the joke, so we\u2019ll just move on.\n\nSo this bear sits down at an empty table and waits for the waiter. The waiter timidly walks up to him and offers him a menu and the bear says, \u201cThat\u2019s no good. I can\u2019t read. I\u2019m a bear. If you could bring me a cheeseburger, though, that would be great.\u201d Now I know what you\u2019re thinking, why can the bear talk but not read? I mean are we supposed to suspend our disbelief as far as talking but not reading? I don\u2019t know. Maybe the bear was in a bad school system. Maybe he\u2019s always been slow. Which is really unfair considering that if the bear can talk he\u2019s pretty damn smart for a bear. Regardless, it\u2019s important for the joke that the bear can talk but he can\u2019t read.\n\nSo the guy goes back to talk to his manager because he\u2019s not sure what to do. After all this is the first time a bear has ever been to the restaurant. The manager asks the waiter, \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me this bear can talk?\u201d The waiter nodded, \u201cBut he can\u2019t read.\u201d The manager shrugged and said, \u201cMust have come from a bad school system.\u201d The waiter agreed but added, \u201cRegardless he\u2019s still obviously pretty smart for a bear.\u201d\n\nSo then the manager gets this bright idea, \u201cYou know, he probably doesn\u2019t really know anything about what people charge for food, and if he can\u2019t read then we could charge him whatever we wanted for his cheeseburger.\u201d See, I told you it was important that the bear couldn\u2019t read.\n\nSo the manager says, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, get him his cheeseburger but charge him $100 for his meal.\u201d So the waiter agrees and gets the bear his burger. The bear eats his burger still making the other patrons uncomfortable. Unless it\u2019s a koala bear then they all think it\u2019s adorable, ya know except for that one guy who had the traumatic koala bear accident.\n\nAfter the meal the waiter tells the bear, \u201cThat will be $100 dollars.\u201d The bear shrugs and pays the man and picks up his hat to leave. The bear was wearing a hat when he came in now, because bears in hats are funny.\n\nOn his way out the waiters stops him and says, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re the first bear we\u2019ve ever had at our restaurant.\u201d The bear grumbles and says, \u201cWith prices like these, it\u2019s no wonder!\u201d\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\n",

Once upon a time their dairy farm had been huge, and business was booming. But a terrible cow-afflicting disease swept throughout the town, and hit this families bovine particularly hard (some believed it to be sabotage, that the disease was introduced by Alpenrose to eliminate all competition. But that's neither here nor there.)\n\nThe farmer had been left with nothing but a single, pathetic old cow. His family was struggling, and making money in any form was a thing of the past. In fact, his sons more or less lived off milk and the hot-pockets they stole from their friends freezers.\n\nOne midsummer's evening, the farmer was feeling particularly good about himself. He had split an onion with his wife for lunch, and he thought a nice glass of fresh, frothy milk might top his day off. His sons had drained the milk that morning, of course, so he grabbed his pistol and strutted off to the barn (the barn was infested with a strange variety of absurdly large rats, quite possibly the source of the infection that had killed most of his cows, and he made a point of killing one on every trip to the barn.)\n\nHe heaved the door open, and began to walk inside.\n\nAnd stopped dead.\n\nThere, in the middle of the barn, lay his single cow in a pool of it's own blood, clearly dead.\n\nThe farmer had always been an honorable man, and a courageous one as well, but the crushing weight of his discovery was to much even for him. He fumbled with the pistol, put the barrel to his head and blew his brains out.\n\nHearing the gunshot, his wife rushed out to the barn. Upon seeing the shit that had gone down in that barn, she also grabbed the gun and blew her brains out.\n\nSeveral hours later, when the bodies were already cold, the eldest son came home from his friend Randall's house. Randall was a massive douchebag. When he couldn't find any milk (or his parents, for that matter) he headed out to the barn to get some for himself.\n\nUpon opening the door, the eldest son saw everything that had happened, and, devastated, he ran down to the stream to drown himself. Just as he was about to thrust his head into the stream, a mermaid popped out.\n\n\"Hello, Farmer Jr.\" She said. \"I can make everything better. But, I have a price. You must have sex with me five consecutive times, no breaks and no mercy. If you fail, I'll drown you myself.\"\n\nFarmer Jr. readily consented, and, to his credit, made it all the way to 4 before his heart gave out. The mermaid sighed and disappeared into the water.\n\nShortly later, the middle son showed up at home, found his parents, and ran down to the river. Again, the mermaid popped up, and promised to fix everything if only he'd have sex with her 10 times. Again, his heart gave out, and he drifted away down the stream.\n\nAs I'm sure you've guessed, the youngest son made his way down to the mermaid as well. Again she promised to rectify everything, if only he'd have sex with her 15 times.\n\n\"15? Please, don't insult me. 20.\" He responded.\n\nThe mermaid was shocked.\n\n\"Fine.\" She smirked. \"Make it 25.\"\n\n\"30!\"\n\n\"Yeahhh, no. 25.\"\n\n\"Deal!\"\n\nAs they were about to begin, the boy stopped and took a step back.\n\n\"Wait wait wait.\" He said. \"One question.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"How...how do you know this won't kill you like it killed the cow?\"",

They're getting out of the car and the seal says, \"Hey, something's wrong with the engine!\" the penguin looks underneath the car, and sure enough there is a puddle of oil forming under the hot engine. Fortunately, they see a service station across the street. So, fighting the heat, they push the car to the shop and ask the mechanic to look at it while they go eat. By this time, the penguin and the seal are about ready to melt, so the penguin orders a huge bowl of ice cream. Unfortunately, he realizes that he cannot use a spoon. Abandoning all composure, the penguin buries his face in the ice cream, getting it all over himself. Meanwhile, the seal enjoys a shrimp basket. Finally, the two finish and go back to the mechanic. \"Well,\" he says from under the hood, \"it looks like you just blew a seal.\" \n\"Nope,\" replied the penguin, still wiping his face. \"Just ice cream.\"",

Immediately, 7 shots are fired, followed by loud screaming. The sounds of a struggle are obvious. The panelists look to each other, worried. \n\nA loud crash is followed by several dull 'thud' sounds. Everything goes silent and the door opens. Out walks the gunny, covered in scratches and cuts. His clothing is torn, blood is running down the side of his face. \n\n\"Gunny! What the Hell happened?\"\n\n\"Well,\" he says. \"Some asshole loaded the gun with blanks.

I called mine *sex*. Now sex has been very embarrassing to me when I went to the city hall to renew the dog's license for sex. I told the clerk I'd like a license for sex he said. \"I would like to have one too!\". Then I said, \"she is a dog!!\". He said he didn't care what she looked like. I said, \"you don't understand. I had sex since I was 9 years old.\" He replied, \"You must have been quite a strong boy.\"\n\nWhen I decided to get married, I told the minister that I would like to have sex at the wedding. He told me to wait until after the wedding was over. I said, \"but sex has played a big part in my life and my life revolves around sex.\" He said he didn't want to hear about my personal life and would not marry us in his church. I told him everybody would like having sex at the wedding. The next day we were married at the justice of peace. My family was barred from the church then on.\n\nWhen my wife and went on out honeymoon, I took the dog with me. When we checked into the motel, I told the clerk that I wanted a room for me and my wife and a special room for sex. He said every room in the motel is a place for sex. I said, \"you don't understand. Sex keeps me awake at night.\" The clerk said, \"me too!\"\n\nOne day I entered sex in a contest. But before the competition began, sex ran away. Another contestant asked me why I was just looking around. I told him that I was going to have sex in the contest. He said that I should have sold my own tickets. \"You don't understand!!\" I said. \"I hoped to have sex on TV!!\". He called me a show off.\n\nWhen my wife and I separated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. I said, \"your honour. I had sex before I was married, but sex left me after I was married.\" The judge said, \"me too!!\"\n\nLast night, sex ran off again. I spent hours looking all over for her. A cop came over and asked me what I was doing in the alley at 4 o'clock in the morning. I said, \"I'm looking for sex.\" My case comes up next Thursday.\n\nWell now I have been thrown in jail, been divorced and had more damn troubles with that dog than I ever foresaw. Why just the other day when I went for my first session with my psychiatrist, she asked me, \"what seems to be the trouble?\" I replied, \"sex has been my best friend all of my life but now it has left me forever. I couldn't live any longer. So lonely.\" The doctor said, \"look mister you should understand sex isn't a man's best friend. So get yourself a dog.\"\n\n**Edit:**\n**Source**- http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-09-01/features/9103050771_1_dog-dear-ann-landers-motel-clerk",

The second kingdom, which farmed bees and their honey as the main form of currency and food, called themselves the Kingdom of Bee. And the third and final kingdom, which fished primarily, called themselves the Kingdom of Sea. \n\nNow, the kingdoms were always debating on which one of them would get the highly profitable land in the middle, which was called Pythagorea. They debated for years and years about this, when finally a wise old man from a distant land came and suggested that they fight it out. Now the kings, being lazy as they were, decided to only send one squire per kingdom to fight; with the victor's kingdom owning the land. All three kings agreed to this, and started training their squires immediately. \n\nThe Kingdom of Ehh sent their squire, who had a slight potbelly and was commonly known around their town as being a slight drunkard. Being the lazy king that he was, the squire had received barely any training, but was extremely overconfident. The Kingdom of Bee sent their squire off too, and their semi-lazy king had trained the squire, but not enough. This one too suffered from overconfidence. However, the king of the Kingdom of Sea was the least lazy of them all, although the poorest, so he sent the best squire the kingdom could offer. This squire trained day and night to defeat the other two, for he had a wife and sons that he not only wanted to return to, but create a home for them in the new land. And so the three squires set off from their homeland in pursuit of one another. \n\nWhen the three squires met, they ran towards each other and started fighting. It was a terrible battle, but it only lasted a couple minutes because the Kingdom of Sea's squire had defeated the other two quickly by stabbing them in the chest. As the two lay dying on the field, one squire said to the other: \"We should have taken him on together.\" The other one replied: \"We may not have even won then.\" The third squire then stood up majestically and said.: \"You two are worth one of me. So on this day forth, let it be known:  \n\n\"That Pythagorea's rule is that Ehh's squire plus Bee's squire equals Sea's squire.\"",

He thinks of his ex-wife, his old business partner, clients and rivals, but cannot come up with anyone who would hate him enough to want him dead. \n\nSo the next day the phone rings, \"H-h-h-hello?\" the man answers. \"The Viper is coming in one hour.\" \"Oh, God,\" the man cries, \"why are you torturing me like this. Just come over here and *do it already*! You sadistic bastard!\" But the voice had already hung up.\n\nExactly one hour later there is a knock at the door. \"Who is it?\" the man asks.  In reply he hears another knock. \"Who is it?\" he asks, louder, getting more frightened. Again, there is no reply but another knock. Frantic now, fearing for his life, the man tears open the door shouting, **\"Alright, do it! Just do it already I can't take it anymore!\"** To which the small Eastern European lady standing outside his door replies \"Alright. I'm the viper, I'm here to vash and vipe the vindows!\"",

Joe was charming enough to bring a lady home but they would always run away at the sight of his enormous manhood. So Joe began looking for surgery to shorten his long johnson. Almost every surgeon and doctor told him that there was no procedure to help him. But Joe didnt give up.  After one doctor visit, as Joe was walking away in disappointment, the doctor called him back. \"I may actually know someone that may be able to help,\" the doctor said in a whisper. \"There is said to be a witch on that hill, there. Go to her, she should know what to do.\" So Joe, skeptical but still curious, went up to see her. She met him on her porch upon Joes arrival, and Joe explained to her his huge dilema. \"Well i have not potions or cures for such an ailment. Yet i know of a frog that that lives out on that pond, there. Go find that frog and ask it to marry you. Every time the frog says 'No' to your proposal your penis will shrink 10 inches.\" Once again Joe didnt know what to make of it all but figured he'll do anything to finally get laid. So Joe goes to the pond and begins searching for this magical frog. After quite some time Joe finally spots the frog, sleeping peacefully on a lilypad. \"Hey frog!\" says Joe. The frog wakes up a bit startled. \"What is it man?\" the frog says. \"Frog, will you marry me?\" The frog, confused, says \"No, i will not marry you, dude.\" Joe feels a tingle in his pants, looks down, and sure enough his penis was only 40 inches. Excitedly he asks again, \"Frog, will you marry me?\" The frog, annoyed, says \"No, dude, i'm not going to marry you.\" Another tingle, another 10 inches gone. Joe, being reasonable, decides he will ask 1 more time, thinking 20 inches would be a doable  penis. \"Frog!\" Joe says. \"What do you want, dude?\" says the frog. \"Will you marry me, frog?\" The frog finally looses his cool and yells \"No, no, and for the last time,no!\"",

This unprecedented academic reform comes at the behest of parents who are concerned about what their children are learning at the school.\n\n  One parent is quoted as saying, \"We thought we'd taught our kids all they needed to know to become adults. They were good kids, you know? They went to church every Sunday, they did their homework, believed in the values of hard work and pulling yourself up by their bootstrap. Then they went off to college, and we weren't impressed. John came home talking about drug and prison reform, and Mary got seriously into feminism! Since they both graduated with Liberal Arts degrees, we figured that's what did it.\"\n\n   Another parent stated, \"My kid went off to school and came home asking why it's wrong for the government to get into my gun safe, but not wrong for it to be in people's bedrooms! Started talkin' about how gay people are entitled to marriage too! It's bull****! The Bible says Adam and EVE, not Adam and STEVE!\"\n\nWe'll have more to report as this story continues to develop.\n\n",

You couldn't get it up if I held a gun to your head!\"\n\n\"I know,\" Harold says, \"but it would be nice if a woman could just hold it for a while.\"\n\n\"Well, I can oblige,\" says Mildred, who unzips his trousers, removes his manhood and proceeds to hold it. Afterward, they agree to meet secretly each night in the garden where they would sit and talk and Mildred would hold Harold's manhood.\n\nThen one night, Harold didn't show up at their usual meeting place. Alarmed, Mildred decided to find Harold to make sure that he was okay.\n\nShe walked around the Senior Citizen Home. She found him sitting by the pool with Ethel, another female resident, who was holding Harold's manhood.\n\nFurious, Mildred yelled, \"You two-timing son of a bitch!

To make matters worse, there was no male gorilla available. \n\nAfter considering nearly all possible options, the Zoo Keeper thought of Bobby Lee Walton, a redneck part-time worker responsible for cleaning the animal cages.  Bobby Lee, a very strong physical man, had little sense but was always bragging about his honky tonk women. The Zoo Keeper thought they might have a solution. Bobby Lee was approached with a proposition. Would he be willing to mate with the gorilla for $500.00? \n\nBobby Lee showed some interest, but said he would have to think the matter over carefully. The following day, he announced that he would accept their offer, but only under four conditions: \n\n\"First\", Bobby Lee said, \"I ain't gonna kiss her on the lips.\" The Keeper quickly agreed to this condition. \n\n\"Second\", he said, \"you can't never tell no one about this, and I mean no one.\" The keeper again readily agreed to this condition. \n\n\"Third\", Bobby Lee said, \"In the event that there are offspring, I want all the children raised Southern Baptist.\" Once again it was agreed. \n\nAnd last,\" Bobby Lee said, \"I'm gonna need another week to come up with the $500.00.\" ",

The pianist is momentarily overcome as he sits down at the majestic instrument. The manager pulls up a chair and tells him that the position pays three hundred dollars a night, but with one condition: \"You have to play only original music.\" Barely able to contain his joy, the pianist says \"That's not a problem at all, I've written hundreds of pieces.\" The manager asks him to play one.\n\nThe pianist launches into an up-tempo post-bop piece with subtly shifting harmonies somewhat reminiscent of Ravel, but with a rhythmic drive that would make McCoy Tyner blush. After he finishes the tune, the manager, floored, asks \"Wow! that's amazing! What's the name of that?\" The pianist tells him It's called \"I love it when you take a huge steaming shit on my grandmother's carpet\".\u00a0\n\nThe manager is taken aback by the the unexpected vulgarity, but because the pianist is so brilliant, he ignores it. The manager asks him to play another of his compositions. He starts off with a poignant rubato introduction and then smoothly slides into a 5/4 samba that features a bi-tonal ostinato section set off by a funk groove section with a surprising update of Coltrane's countdown changes.\n\nThe manager is again thoroughly impressed and reluctantly asks the name of the tune. The pianist says It's called \"I want to stick my head in your panties and suffocate in your wonderfully sickening ass-stench.\" The manager is again startled by the sharply disgusting title, but by this time a crowd had gathered around to enjoy the music.\u00a0\n\nRealizing that he was in the presence of greatness, the manager decides to hire him, but gives him a warning: \"You must promise me one thing. You can't tell anyone the names of your tunes.\" The pianist gives the manager a bemused look, and although he doesn't fully understand this strange request, he agrees.\n\nSo the pianist starts his new job and the crowd is really enjoying his other-worldly dinner music. After a while, nature makes its inevitable call, and he takes a break to go to the men's room. Never the most fastidious person, and being pre-occupied by an idea for a new composition, the pianist neglects to return his manhood to his trousers, and blithely strides out of the men's room.\n\nMistaking the diner's stares for adulation he confidently struts toward the piano, but before he gets there the bartender, shocked, yells out \"Hey man! Do you know your fly's open and your dick and balls are hanging out?\" The pianist gives him a condescending look and says \"Do I KNOW it? I WROTE it!\"",

One day, Fred walks up to Ethel and says, \"Would you like to watch tv together?\" Ethel looks up with a smile and says, \"Yes.\" \n\nWhile they are watching tv, Fred asks Ethel if she would put her hand on his lap. He says that by doing this they can both feel that long lost connection of another human being. Ethel obliges but states that in no way would it lead to sex or anything of that sort. Fred seems fine with the arrangement. A week goes by and they watch tv together that way when one day Ethel succumbs to pneumonia. She is taken to the hospital and given antibiotics. She returns a week later to find Fred watching tv with another woman, Ruth. \n\nDevastated, she walks up to Fred and exclaims, \"I can't believe this is happening. I thought we had something special Fred.\" Fred stammers out an apology. Ethel asks, \"What is it that she has that I don't, Fred?\" to which he replies, \"Parkinson's.\"",

He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. \n\nHe went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample, and deposited the $10. \n\nThe computer made the usual noise and printed out the following message: \n\nYour tap water is too hard.

The treatment consisted of implanting muscle tissue from an elephant's trunk in the man's penis.\n\nThe man thought about it for a while.

You can do whatever you want.. just one thing\" *Adam just finishes loading up his bong and is having another smoke* \"so, it's like you stupid mofo can't let her into the ocean. That's the only requirement!\" Adam's like \"mhmmm... whateves dude\".\n\nThe next day was Monday, Adam wakes up, his morning wood tears through another one of his leaves, he's all pissed off because now he's got to go get a new one and it's in this tree and there's a fucking snake, anyway, that doesn't matter, he looks over to Eve and his morning wood almost punches him in the stomach. He's like \"wtf?\". He goes over to Eve, Eve's eyeing him up and down, licks her lips, at that moment, her leaf drops and she bends over to pick it up, the rest is history (up to your imagination).\n\nTuesday comes, whilst Adam's doing Eve, his bong drops off her back and he notices there's another hole there, just a bit higher. What's a guy to do? He sticks it in there hoping for the best, and it is! Now Eve's making all these new noises and Adam's feeling very alpha.\n\nBy Friday they're into bondage, he's even skinned one of the fluffy animals, in the garden of Eden, to make a spank table out of it. They're at it again, God rides his Harley by, looks at Adam, shakes his index finger and says \"remember what I told you, douchebag!\" Adam's like \"yea whatev's bro!\"\n\nSaturday, they're into hardcore BDSM, Eve's tied to a tree, snake and all, Adam's practicing auto erotic asphyxiation whilst he's slapping Eve, by Saturday night they're all bruised and feeling very satisfied.\n\nSunday morning comes Eve wakes up, kisses Adam on the cheek and whispers \"let's do it again\" at this point Adam's exhausted, so he fumbles away and mumbles \"leave me alone, even God rested on Sunday, do something else\". Eve's like \"ok, I'll go for a swim into the ocean, do some sight seeing, maybe pay that snake a visit, he was great last night\". Eve walks on the beach, takes off her leaf, folds it and places it on the warm sand, giggles and goes straight into the ocean. At that point *poof, God appears and he's wearing steel cap boots. Starts kicking Adam and punching him in the head* Adam's like \"wtf man? wtf? fuuuuck, stop!\" punches and kicks don't slow down, they keep coming, and God thunders \"what the fuck did I tell you, you imbecile?\" Adam's like \"I don't know, I was out of my mind smoking dope and shit man, fuck, stop!\" God thunders again \"Told you not to leave Eve into the ocean you stupid mofo!\" Adam: \"fuuuuuck stop man! what's wrong with the ocean?\" God: \"now we're never going to get the smell out of the fish!\". \n\n*thank you and sorry to all of you who now hate me*",

Can you just tell me what's going on?\"\n\n\"Well you see,\" Roshi replied, \"for most people, and especially for most educated people like you and I, what we perceive and experience is heavily mediated, through language and concepts that are deeply ingrained in our ways of thinking and feeling. Our objective here is to induce in ourselves and in each other a psychological state that involves the unmediated experience of the world, because we believe that that state has certain desirable properties. It's impossible in general to reach that state through any particular form or method, since forms and methods are themselves examples of the mediators that we are trying to avoid. So we employ a variety of ad hoc means, some linguistic like koans and some non-linguistic like zazen, in hopes that for any given student one or more of our methods will, in whatever way, engender the condition of non-mediated experience that is our goal. And since even thinking in terms of mediators and goals tends to reinforce our undesirable dependency on concepts, we actively discourage exactly this kind of analytical discourse.\"\n\nAnd the student was enlightened.",

Would you help me catch a fish for the meal?\"\n\n\"I'd be glad to help!\" said the young man.\n\nAbout an hour later and with the young man's help Father O'Leary finally got a fish on the line. As he was no fisherman he nearly lost it but with the boy's assistance the rather large fish was reeled in.\n\n\"Wow!\" exclaimed the young man. \"I thought we'd lost him there for a second! Just look at it-- that is one huge son of a bitch!\"\n\nFather O'Leary's smile from his success turned into a frown. \"Young man,\" he said, \"you forget yourself. I am a man of the cloth. You should not use such foul language around me.\"\n\nThe young fisherman, thinking quickly, said, \"No, no! You don't understand. That fish right there? It's a *sonofabitch*. Very common in these waters, you see, but this one is particularly large!\"\n\nO'Leary looked at the flopping fish for a moment, considered, and then nodded. \"Well... if that's its name then that's its name. And you're right, he is rather large! God has blessed us with a wonderful meal to serve our new pope.\"\n\nWhen Father O'Leary returned to his church he discovered that Bishop Conner had arrived during his absence. He explained to the bishop his plan for serving the new pope a special dinner that night.\n\n\"A most wonderful idea!\" said Bishop Conner. \"If only I could also contribute somehow...\"\n\n\"Well,\" said O'Leary, \"I was going to do it myself but if you'd like you may gut and clean the fish. I would warn warn you, though, that it is one very large *sonofabitch*.\"\n\nThe bishop's cheerful smile disappeared. \"Father!\" he scolded. \"Have you forgotten yourself!? How dare you use such language in a house of God!\"\n\n\"No, no, you don't understand,\" pleaded the priest. \"That's the fish I caught, a *sonofabitch*. The young man who helped me catch it said that they are plentiful in these waters but that this is one of the largest he's ever seen!\"\n\n\"Ah, I see,\" nodded the bishop. \"Well then, I wouldn't mind cleaning the sonofabitch for his Holiness!\"\n\nAfter gutting and cleaning the fish Bishop Conner brought it to the Mother Superior. \"Pope Francis will arrive for dinner soon,\" he told the elderly woman. \"Please take special care preparing this meal. I have personally gutted and cleaned the *sonofabitch* but as you can see, this *sonofabitch* is very large.\"\n\nThe mother superior's face drained of color and her eyes went wide at the Bishops words. \"Wh-- wha--?\" she stammered while clutching her rosaries. \n\nBishop Conner, realizing his mistake, quickly said, \"No, no, I know what you're thinking, Mother. Worry not, I have not profaned: this fish is what's known as a *sonofabitch*. There are many in these waters and this one is particularly large.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" the woman smiled in relief. \"Forgive me, your excellency... I had never heard of such a fish. I shall begin cooking this *sonofabitch* right away.\"\n\nLater that evening the new pope honored his hosts by saying grace before the meal was served. Every dignitary from the village was there and each was able to enjoy some of that large fish during dinner. All agreed that it was a delicious, most wonderful course. Most complimentary of all, though, was the new pope.\n\n\"This was truly exquisite,\" the pontiff said after clearing his plate. \"Who do I have to thank for such a tasty and well prepared meal and from such a small and humble village no less?\"\n\nFather O'Leary spoke first. \"I caught the *sonofabitch!*\" he proudly announced.\n\nBishop Conner quickly followed, \"I cleaned the *sonofabitch!*\"\n\nThe mother superior declared, \"I cooked the *sonofabitch!*\"\n\nMost of the guests at the table gasped in shock.

So what's your story?\"\n\nSo the first man replies: \"Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell -- but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony.\"\n\n\"That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,\" said Peter, and let the man in.\n\nThe second man comes up and St. Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story.\n\n\"It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I'm here.\"\n\nOnce again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death.\n\nThe third man came to the front of the line, and again Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story.\n\"Picture this,\" says the third man, \"I'm hiding inside a refrigerator...\"",

He feels sucessful for the first time in his life but he is starting to fall back on his old ways. One day he goes to the casino and he loses and he loses and he loses and he gambled all his money away and he gets fired to boot because gambling is against company policy. So he is back down to a level 1 cheerio. He gets a job on a production line at a nearby factory and determines himself not to fall back ever again. So he works and he works and he works and he works and he WORKS, level 2, level 3, and he is doing great again. He is promoted to Floor manager of the factory and he is doing great and becomes a level 4 cheerio. But then one day a rival company sabotages their operation by putting poison in their toothpaste or whatever the hell they were making. They have to pay out damages and PR and the like and they declare bankruptcy. He is knocked back down to level 2 for the lack in income. But he is hired almost straight away by a branch of a huge conglomerate because they recognized how hard of a worker he is. So he works, level 3, works, level 4, and he works and works and WORKS. So he is promoted to CEO of the branch that he works in. A few months pass and he is approaching level 5 status when the Head of the entire conglomerate decides to retire. He weighs his options for his replacement and sees our guy and what a hard worker he is and chooses him as his replacement. So our guy is now the CEO of a huge company, a level 5 cheerio and making Bill Gates level money and he finally becomes a Frosted Cheerio. So he goes to the princess and asks her again, \"will you marry me?\" and she says \"Yes I will marry you now.\" So a few months pass and theyre at the wedding recption, they allready said their vows and the party is winding down. The newlywed wife tells her husband \"Hey I'm thirsty, can you go over to the bar and get me a Gin and Tonic or something?\" So the dutiful guy he is he went over to the bar and low and behold the bartender wasnt there. So he waits and he waits and he waits and he waits 15 minutes and the bartender still hadnt shown up so he decided he must have gone home since the party was winding down. So he went back to his wife and tells her the bartender wasnt there, can I get you something else? she replies: \"Ok, its fine. Here take this dollar and go buy me a Diet Coke at the vending machine in the lobby. So he goes to get it and theres a line for the machine. It was the princesses wedding so obviously a lot of people would show up. So he waits and he waits and he waits in line and he finally gets up to the machine only to find that the prices were hiked because they knew they could gouge them. So he goes back to his wife gets another dollar and waits and waits and WAITS in lineonly to find once he finally reached the front that they were out of Diet Coke. So he buys a regular Coke instead and takes it to his wife. She throws it away saying she needs to keep her figure yadda, yadda, yadda. So she tells him to get a cup off the table and get her some water from the cooler. So he goes over there and there is a line there too so he waits and he waits and he waits in line and the cooler runs out of water 5 people ahead of him. So exasperated he goes back to his wife and tells her, look there out of water is there any other source of liquid in this damn place. So she tells him \"screw it, just to go get some punch from the punch bowl.\" So he leaves, gets the punch, and comes back within a minute. She says \"wow, that was fast. What happened? How did you get it so fast?\" and he replies \"Well it was a short wait because there was no punchline.\"",

She is as dumb as a box of rocks and frankly I'm surprised she has sufficient brainpower to continue breathing.\n\nThe next chick is a polar opposite. She is possibly one of the smartest people on the planet. She has virtually endless career opportunities and yet, her she is with us. She is a 0 on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm not sure she so much as showers, much less shaves her 'womanly' parts. I think she might be a lesbian, as every time we drive by the hardware store, I swear to god she moans like a cat.\n\nBut the jewel of the crowd, has to be the fucking stoner. Now, I'm talking more that your average pothead. In fact, the guy is baked before he comes into work, during work, and I'm sure after work as well. He probably hasn't been sober at any point in the last ten years and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and on top of it all, he brings his huge fucking dog to work.

So, the monarch offered him his freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult question. Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer and, if after a year, he still had no answer, he would be put to death. \n\nThe question?...What do women really want? Such a question would perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and to young Arthur, it seemed an impossible query. But, since it was better than death, he accepted the monarch's proposition to have an answer by year's end. \n\nHe returned to his kingdom and began to poll everyone: the princess, the priests, the wise men and even the court jester. He spoke with everyone, but no one could give him a satisfactory answer. \n\nMany people advised him to consult the old witch, for only she would have the answer. \n\nBut the price would be high; as the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged \n\nThe last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no choice but to talk to the witch. She agreed to answer the question, but he would have to agree to her price first. \n\nThe old witch wanted to marry Sir Lancelot, the most noble of the Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend! \n\nYoung Arthur was horrified. She was hunchbacked and hideous, had only one tooth, smelled like sewage, made obscene noises, etc. He had never encountered such a repugnant creature in all his life. \n\nHe refused to force his friend to marry her and endure such a terrible burden; but Lancelot, learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur \n\nHe said nothing was too big of a sacrifice compared to Arthur's life and the preservation of the Round Table \n\nHence, a wedding was proclaimed and the witch answered Arthur's question thus:\n\nWhat a woman really wants, she answered...is to be in charge of her own life. \n\nEveryone in the kingdom instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and that Arthur's life would be spared. \n\nAnd so it was, the neighbouring monarch granted Arthur his freedom and Lancelot and the witch had a wonderful wedding. \n\nThe honeymoon hour approached and Lancelot, steeling himself for a horrific experience, entered the bedroom. But, what a sight awaited him. The most beautiful woman he had ever seen lay before him on the bed. The astounded Lancelot asked what had happened \n\nThe beauty replied that since he had been so kind to her when she appeared as a witch, she would henceforth, be her horrible deformed self only half the time and the beautiful maiden the other half. \n\nWhich would he prefer? Beautiful during the day....or night? \n\nLancelot pondered the predicament. During the day, a beautiful woman to show off to his friends, but at night, in the privacy of his castle, an old witch? Or, would he prefer having a hideous witch during the day, but by night, a beautiful woman for him to enjoy wondrous intimate moments? \n\nWhat would YOU do? \n\nWhat Lancelot chose is below. \n\nBUT....make YOUR choice before you scroll down below. \n\nOKAY? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Lancelot said that he would allow HER to make the choice herself. \n\nUpon hearing this, she announced that she would be beautiful all the time because he had respected her enough to let her be in charge of her own life. \n\n*Now....what is the moral to this story?*\n\n\n\n\n\nThe moral is..... \n\nIf you don't let a woman have her own way, things are going to get ugly",

The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.\n\n\nThe next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.\n\n\nThe battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage.

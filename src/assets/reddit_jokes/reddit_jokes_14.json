Sometimes he changes it like for the New Years he sets it as the year, or Christmas time when he changes it to the date, but it's late fall right now so there he has it set as the regular code. Although once he decided to be a little generous, he got a new heating system for the office, it's a little screwy sometimes, you turn the heat on but it never actually turns on. But the heaters came with new thermostats, these show the date and the time on them.\n\n There are only three other guys in the office, Tim, he's just a weird one, he asks about what kind of stamps we buy, I don't like him much. Then there is some gay guy. I can't remember his name, he's not exactly a vibrant person, he blends in to the office like he is part of it. Lastly there is an old guy, he's been in the office for decades now, I think he might just be dead and no one ever checked, I have never seen that man leave his office chair. \n\nRight now, we are all working overtime, I think I might have forgotten to go home last night, I can't remember. There was a big crisis back at HQ and now we are stuck with the paperwork. I really don't know what day it is.

The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air.\n\nEvery morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor, she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. \n\nThe years went by and he continued to rip them out. Then one Christmas day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the bed covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. \n\nSometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bath room. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. \n\nShe bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, \u201cHoney you were right\u2026 all these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked his wife. \u201cWell, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened, but by the grace of god, some Vaseline and two fingers.

Within a net, the beast desperately tired to free itself, but with each attempt, became more and more entangled and howled louder and louder in pain. Upon approaching the massive beast, the man quickly became intensely scared, nervous that the gorilla would retaliate. Trembling with beads of sweat drenched across his brow, the man slowly cut the net and the gorilla stomped through the jungle and never turned back.\n\nYears later a happy man returned to the jungle with a new born child in search of a way to teach his son a new way of life. To show him that it is the small things in life that make a difference to better humanity. Upon traversing across a small, misty creek littered with green ferns the man saw a scarred gorilla by a river bed. He was sure that this was the same gorilla he had saved from the net years ago. The gorilla turned and made eye contact with the happy man, son by his side. As the man approached and held out his arm to greet the familiar creature, the gorilla hoisted him high up into the air and vigorously bashed his brains in on a giant rock. He was thrown far into the river and drowned to death. Must have not have been the same gorilla.\n",

It just so happend that Vladimir, the Russian Ambassador, and Umballa, the Zambian Ambassador, were sharing a suite. To pass the time, Vladimir introduced his fellow dignitary to the Russian game of roulette. He produced an antique Soviet revolver, and a single bullet. It took a while, but he was finally able to explain the gist of the game to Umballa. Intrigued and excited, Umballa loved the game. By the time the U.N. meeting was over, the two had become fast friends. As they parted company at the airport, Umballa told Vladimir, ''One day, you must visit my country, and try our version of your roulette.''\n\nA year later, Vladimir was in Zambia, and looked up his old friend. Umballa remembered him, and welcomed him with open arms.\n\n''I have come, my comrade, to try your game.''\n\n''Very well. Come with me.'' Umballa took his friend before six,\n buck-naked bush women. ''Pick one. Any one. And she will give you a blowjob.''\n\n''But my friend, where is the danger in this?''\nUmballa replied with a toothy smile, ''One of them is a cannibal.''",

Make a name for yourself and hire more people to sell your product to all the restaurants in the area until you're a local name. Then open your own place, work hard day and night and make it a success then open another and another, delegating and training more people to take over sections of the business. Grow and expand into other towns, invest in advertising, eventually open up a franchise and go international! At the height of your business, sell it! You'll make a fortune.\"\n\nThe local waits for the translation, thinks carefully, then asks, \"and what would I do with this fortune?\"\n\nThe businessman laughs and replies, \"Whatever you want!

He had come a very long way to see the beautiful views and wildlife of the island.\n\nHe rented himself a car at the airport and set off to see the sights.\nBut just as he started down the airport road, he heard a thump from under his rental cars tire.\nThinking he may have rented a lemon, he pulled to the shoulder of the road an got out to check the car.\nWith utter dismay he realized he had struck a poor defenseless bunny rabbit, that had been trying to cross the road.\nThe Tourist was a devote vegan and was torrmented to tears at the sight, of the poor creatures limp body laying behind his car on the road.\nCarefully he picked up the body an carried it gently to the shoulder of the road.\n\nAs the tourist was doing this, a local fisherman, who was off to pick up his brother in law from the airport. Cause his brother in law, Herald, was back on his turn around from Alberta. Well the fisherman saw the strange sight of the vegan tourist cradling the body of the critter in his arms crying on the side of the road.\nBeing aweful currious an knowing Herald was likely drunk looking for his luggage still, the fisherman pulled over to investigate the situation.\n\n\"Whats going on witth ya there skip?\" Said the fisherman\nAs he emerged from his beat up f150 he had parked on the other side of the road.\nStill crying profusely the Vegan looked up at the Fisherman with water filled eyes, still cradling the body of the rabbit in his arms. Unable to speak from the shock an utter devastation he was going through after the event.\nFinally he was able to form the words he dreaded to admit to himself. \"I ...I.. I hit this poor rabbit with my car\"\nHe then began to loudly wail in anguished mournfull regret.\n\"Calm down now skipper, no need bawling your eyes out.\" The fisherman said sternly.\nKneeling down he touched the rabbit with his large battered weather worn hands. \"Thats no a rabbit, here we calls em Hares\" \nThe vegan looked up at the wrinkled hairy face of the fisherman, tears barely held in, he sucked back a sob. \"What?\" He mumbled, confused by the fisherman's choice of topic.\n\"Hold on, I gets something out of the truck, fix em right up.\" With that the fisherman quickly ran to the rear door of his truck, and began rummaging through the large pile of seemingly useless things he stored there. Within moments he returned, shaking a spray can, back and forth in his hands.\n\"What is that?\" Asked the vegan tourist, his sadness turning slowly to curiosity.\n\"Just put em down I shows ya\" replied the fishman.\nThe Tourist being completely enthralled with what the old fisherman could have in mind, obliged and placed the small Rabbit on the ground and stepped back.\n\nThe old fisherman, knelt down an sprayed some of the contents of the can he had retrieved from his beaten up pickup truck, on the limp body of the rabbit.\n\nTo the complete amazement of the vegan tourist, the small Rabbit jumped to it's feet! It looked up at the two men an raised its front paw, shaking it in their direction. It then hopped it's way across the road as the tourist looked in a stupor of disbelief. However just as it reached the shoulder of the road on the other side, it collapsed in a heap. \nThe tourist roared in dismay! \"Oh god! No! The poor rabbit! What's going on? What's in that can!? What just happened?\"\nThe fisherman paid him no mind, he walked across the road, looking over his shoulder at the vegan he began to coat the rabbit in spray, soaking it into the fur.\"we call them hares here skip, not rabbits. Must not of used enough I spose?\" \nThe tourist's eyes rolled in complete confusion at the statement from the old fisherman.\nBut before he could say anything the rabbit jumped back to it's feet! It shook it's front paw again once at the fisherman a second time directly at the vegan tourist. Then it dove into the long grass by the road side, running up over the hill, it stopped at the very crest of the hill and turned to view them. \nRaising both it's front paws it shook them in the direction of the men then disappeared over the hill out of sight.\n\nThe old fisherman just smirked, and began to walk back towards his truck. \nThe tourist flabbergasted rushed to the window of the truck demanding answers.\n\"Sir! I must know! What is in that spray can? How did it bring the rabbit back to life?\"\nThe old fisherman just smiled at him\n\"We call them hares here skip, an take a look for yourself.\"\nHanding the spray can to the tourist\n\"And ya gotta read the fine print on er.\"\n\n*hair spray - Guaranteed to bring your hair back to life, with a permanent wave",

One particular evening, the sky was red with beautiful cirrus clouds, the breeze warm and gentle-a perfect night for romance.\nAs they sat there, the sheep started looking better and better to the man. Soon, he leaned over to the sheep and put his arm around it. But the dog got jealous, growling fiercely until the man took his arm from around the sheep. After that, the three of them continued to enjoy the sunsets together, but there was no more cuddling. A few weeks passed by and lo and behold, there was another shipwreck.\nThe only survivor was a beautiful young woman, the most beautiful woman the man had ever seen. She was badly injured when they rescued her, and they slowly nursed her back to health. When the young maiden was well enough, they introduced her to their evening beach ritual. It was another beautiful evening: red sky, cirrus clouds, a warm and gentle breeze-perfect for a night of romance.\nPretty soon the man started to get \"those feelings\" again. He fought them as long as he could, but he finally gave in, leaned over to the young woman and cautiously whispered in her ear, \" Would you mind taking the dog for a walk?",

Here you go.\" The little alley downs his water and scampers out of the bar. The two-way street orders some Pepsi and sits down to read his morning paper.\n\nSuddenly, a mean old 2-lane highway storms in, and yells \"Out of my seat ya weenie.\" The street replied, \"Sir, I'm trying to enjoy my refreshment and read the morni...\" WHAM! The highway smacks the street on the head and the street decides he's going to be a pacifist today \"I mean of course, it's your seat, my apologies.\" \"Gimme some beer, not that pussy ass girly cola.\" The bartender pulls out the finest Miller Light he can find and passes it to the highway. \n\nAll was peaceful until around 4PM when Interstate 95 runs in during rush hour \"MOVE OUT OF THE WAY BITCH I'M IN A HURRY\". \"FUGGIN MAKE EM YA BASTARD\" and the two hammer away at each other. The two go at it for a few minutes, but the highway could not keep up with the fury of hundreds of short-tempered drivers that had just been cut off. The interstate grabs the highway,\"GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY ASS\" and tosses him where the 2-way street was nursing his headwound. The interstate claims victory, finishes his beer and says \"QUICK BARTENDER, GIMME SOME VODKA\"  The interstate begins to down vodka by the handle. \n\nHalfway through the 3rd handle of vodka, the Autobahn walks in \"Out of my way, you puny little piece of asphalt.\" The Autobahn grabs his gun and puts 6 rounds into the interstate. He sits down and tells the bartender, \"I want the blood of my enemies mixed with your hardest rum on the rocks, shaken, not stirred.\" The bartender squeezes out some of the interstate's blood from an open gunshot wound and uses the bullets for ice. He mixes it with rum and serves it to the autobahn. But before the autobahn can pick up his drink, a little dirt bike trail walks in. The autobahn says \"Ha, I suppose you're gonna make me move out of my chair?\" The trail starts screaming and grabs the autobahn by his head and rips him limb from limb. With a guttural cry of victory the little bike trail runs out. At this point, the highway has recovered sufficiently to ask the street, \"Gee what's his problem?\"\n\nThe street replies, \"Oh him? He's a cycle path.\"",

It was the one where you make words with wooden tiles.  I point them out to the owner, and ask him why they're up playing so late.  The owner explains that these two rock climberswanted to buy the same rock climbling-themed board game from the store, and they had both gotten into a heated argument over who got to buy it.  Not wanting an all-out fist fight on a crowded night, he had them play a \"best of nine\" tournament of the board game, and the winner would earn the right to buy the set.\n\nI nodded sagely.

Tim greatly enjoyed conducting his train around every day, and even though he had relatively poor pay, all was well in Tim's world. There was only one issue; Tim was a flat out *awful* conductor. He reduced the overall efficiency of all of the trains nearly every day by screwing up his timing, causing other trains to have to wait on him. \n\nTim's conducting got worse and worse as time went on. One day, Tim decided to try and eat his lunch while doing his job. Seeing as he could hardly work while focused, this was a terrible idea, but Tim decided to do it anyway. This was a mistake. Another train, hurtling at his train at great speed, was scheduled to pass through the area that Tim was currently in. It was Tim's responsibility to yield to the other train to prevent a crash. Unbeknownst to the other conductor, Tim was unaware that the other train was coming, so Tim plowed on in his train, not a care in the world. Biting into the sandwich his wife had packed, Tim's eyes closed to savor the taste. The other train began to cross in front of him, but seeing as Tim's eyes were closed, Tim did not see the train, and didn't stop. The two collided, the screeching of metal against metal combined with the crashing as the two trains were flung off of their tracks.\n\nTim was fired on the spot. Devastated, Tim went home to his wife. Her kind, loving smile upon seeing him made his insides melt, and it was in that moment Tim realized he couldn't bear to break the news to her. Acting as though nothing was wrong, Tim left the next day as if going to work, but instead drank at a nearby pub the entire day. This continued for weeks until Tim ran out of money. Crushed and guilty, Tim went home again and told his wife everything, begging for her forgiveness.\n\nShe left him.\n\nTim had nothing left to live for, and considered taking his own life. While mulling it over, a thought struck him; if the other conductor had stopped *his* train, none of this would have happened. In Tim's deluded mind, this though evolved into another: revenge. \n\nTim tracked down the other conductor. In the dead of night, Tim snuck into the poor mans house. The crack of a gunshot echoed through the streets as Tim shot the man. The police found Tim lying on top of the dead man, laughing maniacally. After a short trial, Tim was sentenced to death.\n\nTim looked blankly foreword as he was strapped in an electric chair. The executioner turned a switch, and a leathal shock pulsed through the chair. Miraculously, Tim survived. The baffled executioner tried again and again to execute Tim, but was unsuccessful. Scientist were brought in to try and figure out what was causing this strange phenomenon, but not a single one could find the truth. Eventually, the scientists became desparate enough to ask Tim if he understood why the chair could not kill him. Through a haze of madness, inspiration struck Tim. He look up at the scientist and said: \n\n\"Well, I never was a very good conductor.\"",

I backed a horse last week at ten to one.  It came in at quarter past four.        \n\n \n\n37.   I swear, the other day I bought a packet of peanuts, and on the packet it said ''may contain nuts.'' Well, YES! That's what I bought the buggers for! You'd be annoyed if you opened it and a socket set fell out!''           \n\n \n\n38.   A lorry-load of tortoises crashed into a trainload of terrapins, What a turtle disaster     \n\n \n\n39.  My phone will ring at 2 in the morning, and my wife'll look at me and go, ''Who's that calling at this time?' ''I don't know! If I knew that we wouldn't need the bloody phone!''    \n\n \n\n40.  I said to this train driver ''I want to go to Paris\". He said ''Eurostar?'' I said, ''I've been on telly but I'm no Dean Martin''.\n\n \n\n41.   Two Eskimos sitting in a kayak were chilly. But when they lit a fire in the craft, it sank, proving once and for all that you can't have your kayak and heat it.      \n\n \n\n42.  I've got a friend who's fallen in love with two school bags, he's bisatchel.          \n\n \n\n43.  You see my next-door neighbour worships exhaust pipes, he's a catholic converter.     \n\n \n\n44.  A three-legged dog walks into a saloon in the Old West. He slides up to the bar and announces: ''I'm looking for the man who shot my paw.''   \n\n \n\n45.   I tried water polo but my horse drowned.      \n\n \n\n46.   I'll tell you what I love doing more than anything: trying to pack myself in a small suitcase. I can hardly contain myself.  \n\n \n\n47.   So I met this gangster who pulls up the back of people's pants, it was Wedgie Kray.   \n\n \n\n48.   Went to the corner shop - bought 4 corners.            \n\n \n\n49.  A seal walks into a club...   \n\n \n\n50.   I went to the Doctors the other day, and he said, 'Go to Bournemouth, it's great for flu'. So I went  -  and I got it.",

He got out, and with all his strength in his weak flippers, he pushed the car over hill and dale.\r\r\"Whew!\" he sighed.\r\rAs luck would have it, there was a mechanic in town, and he told the penguin that he'd have to spend some time with the car. \"Why don't you come back in an hour or so?\"\r\rWiping the sweat from his brow, the penguin spied an ice cream shop. \"Hurray!\" he cried. \"I'll be back, toot sweet!\" he said.\r\rHe ordered the tallest vanilla ice cream he could hold between his wings... those miserable fins could barely manage the scoops upon scoops of creamy goodness. The cone was so tall that more of it ended up on the penguin than in him!\r\r\"Yummy! That was very very good!\" the penguin said, smacking his lips.\r\rHe waddled back to the mechanic who was ready to give the little fellow an update. The mechanic looked at the penguin sternly. The gaskets and seals on the engine were severely damaged after years of driving without a routine check, and it was certainly going to be expensive.\r\r\"Well, it looks like you blew a seal.\"\r\r\"Oh no, that's just ice cream!\" the penguin said, wiping the ice cream from his chin.\r\r\r\r\rMy grandpa told me this one.

He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper\u2019s cemetery in the back country. As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost.\n\nI finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.\n\nI felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn\u2019t know what else to do, so I started to play.\n\nThe workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I\u2019ve never played before for this homeless man.\n\nAnd as I played \u2018Amazing Grace,\u2019 the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my guitar and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.\n\nAs I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, \u201cI never seen nothin\u2019 like that before and I\u2019ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.\u201d\n\nApparently, I\u2019m still lost\u2026\n",

Having cut down the tree Noah left, hoping to return to a multitude of snakes.\nIt took many weeks upon months, but eventually the snakes produced a small number of young. The snakes requested to Noah that they cut down more trees. Noah obliged. After many trees were cut down, Noah asked the snakes in bewilderment, \"snakes, why is it that you need to have trees be cut down to produce children? I ask you to go forth and multiply, but you have me cutting down trees!\"\nThe snakes look at each other, and reply \"we need you to cut down trees for us to be both fruitful and to multiply.\"\nNoah replies \"but why is it so I am cutting down precious trees for you to produce young?\"\nOne of the snakes pulls Noah aside and whispers to him \"Noah, we respect you, but it is an embarrassing topic to talk about our sexual behaviour.\"\n\"All I ask if the reason why you have me cutting down trees, snake!\"\nThe snake replies \"we're adders.

He was now fed up of being the subject of constant jokes of his friends, relatives and many-a-times, complete strangers.  \n  \nThere was a time when he was proud of his unusually long penis, thinking of it as an indicator of much masculinity. But that was few years ago. He had heard that most women liked it big, and was excited for his first time, but was severely disappointed when his then girlfriend had been so terrified after unzipping his pants, that she had straightway declined to even touch it. He had now come to realize that there is such a thing as a too large penis.  \n  \nSo now, the boy, deciding that he had had enough, packed his bags and set out on a journey to find a way to reduce the size of his penis. After months of wandering around and seeking for a solution to his problem, he was told of a wise man who could most definitely solve his problem because, the legend said, the wise man had never ever failed to that day.  \n  \nAfter a long and an arduous journey, he found the man he was looking for. The wise man heard his tale and gave him the directions to a lake. He told the boy that on reaching the lake, he was to raise his voice and say his name. If he was lucky he would be answered by a mermaid. He was to ask the mermaid to marry him. That, according to the wise man, would solve his problems.  \n  \nThe boy followed the path the wise man had given him and in a few days, he reached the lake. Quite a few times, he called his name loudly over the silence. Nothing happened. Just when he was disappointed, and thought that his entire journey had been in vain, a beautiful mermaid appeared out of the water and sat on the stone at the edge of the lake.  \n  \nSmiling, the mermaid asked, \"How may I help you, human?\"  \n  \nExcited, the boy hurriedly asked her that what he was supposed to ask, \"O dear mermaid, will you marry me?\"  \n  \nThe mermaid, still smiling, simply said, \"No.\"  \n  \nSuddenly, the boy's penis was reduced from 25 inches to 20 inches. Tears of happiness welled through his eyes. But even through this intense happiness, the boy found himself thinking, 20 inches is better than 25, but 15 would be even great.  \n  \nThus, he asked the mermaid again, \"Will you marry me?\"  \n  \nThe mermaid's smile faded a little, but even so, she replied curtly, \"No.\"  \n  \nThe boy's penis reduced from 20 inches to 15 inches. Now, again, he thought, 15 inches is better still, but a 10 inches penis would be ideal. A 10 inches penis would be perfect.  \n  \nThus, he asked the mermaid again, \"Will you marry me?\"  \n  \nThe mermaid, now visibly frowning, and clearly annoyed, replied in an irritated voice, \"How many times do I have to say that to you?! No! No! No!\"",

Months later, much like the first encounter, Ben woke up to a crow on his window sill. \"Your doggie is gonna die.\" cawked the crow.  Ben then made his way down to the kitchen table for breakfast where his parents informed him that his dog Buddy had \"ran away\". Later in that same month a final visit came from the crow \"Your daddy's gonna die\".  Ben became very scared, so much that he confessed everything to his father, including the previous prophecies from the black bird. Ben's father was distraught and went through work that day paranoid as he expected a car to hit him or an attack while on the street. He made it safely through the day and returned home to tell his wife how horrible his day had been. \"It was terrible, I peeked around every corner expecting death to be there waiting for me.  You don't know how it feels to think that your life will end on this very day.\" His wife responded \"You think your day was bad, today the gardener collapsed dead right in our flowerbed!\"",

A priest was just about to go into surgery for a stomach problem at their hospital, so he rearranged things to have him and the nurse do the operation. He delivered the baby by c-section, took care of the priest's stomach problem, quietly made arrangements for the nurse to recover at her home ... and proclaimed a miracle: the priest hadn't actually had a stomach problem ... he'd been pregnant! He just delivered a healthy baby boy!\n\nAmazingly, everyone believed it, including the priest. He took the boy home from the hospital, and raised it as his own. As the boy grew up, the priest wouldn't tell him about his origin. Whenever the boy asked, \"Who's my father?\" the priest said, \"I'll let you know when you are 16.\"\n\nWhen the boy turned 16, the priest finally told him the story. He told about how he'd gone into the hospital, and the boy had been miraculously born into the world. The boy said, \"Wow ... so you really are my father!\"\n\nThe priest said, \"Well actually, I'm your mother. The arch-bishop ... he's really your father.\"",

we\u2019ll all be floating on top of the water\n\nand I\u2019ll be like HEY JOHN IT\u2019S GREAT TO BE ALIVE, HUH?\n\nand you\u2019ll be like HEY NICHOLAS\n\nI CAN TOTALLY SEE YOUR FACE BECAUSE IT IS DAY TIME AND THIS PLAN IS FOOLPROOF\n\nsound good?\n\nand the Carpenter is like THAT SOUNDS GREAT AND ALSO TOTALLY BELIEVABLE\n\ncarpenters: SOOOOO DUMB AM I RIGHT\n\nso John goes around and sets up all this dumb stuff that is super dumb\nand then that night he and his wife and Nicholas all climb into the tubs\nlike GOODNIGHT GUYS\n\nLET\u2019S ALL PRAY BECAUSE THIS IS A REAL THING THAT IS HAPPENING\n\nand then while John is praying\n\nAllison and Nicholas climb out of the tubs\n\nsneak inside\n\nand FUUUUUUUUUCK\n\n\n\n\nbut guys\n\nguys\n\nthis is where it gets REALLY GREAT\n\ncause there\u2019s this other scholar dude\n\nhis name is Absalon\n\nand this asshole thinks he\u2019s SO DAMN PRETTY\n\nyou know the type\n\nhe\u2019s the guy with the van halen hair\n\nand he plays guitar\n\nand every time a religious holiday rolls around\n\nhe is the dude carrying the censer\n\nwhich is a big mace full of incense\n\nthat he uses to go into hot chick\u2019s houses\n\nand bathe them with sweet-smelling smoke\n\nseriously\n\nthis guy had to join the church to come up with an excuse to fondle women\n\nhow fucked up is that?\n\nalso\n\nhe is CONSTANTLY going into bars\n\nand playing his fucking guitar to try and get with the waitresses\n\nand despite that\n\nhe\u2019s a real squeamish dude\n\nwho is TERRIFIED of farts\n\nman I bet THAT won\u2019t come into play at all right?\n\n\n\n\nbut so obviously Absalon is hot on Allison\n\nand when he hears a rumor circulating around town\n\nthat no one has seen John all day\n\n(cause john is in his shed building his dumbass contraption)\n\nand he\u2019s like SWEET\n\nNOW\u2019S MY CHANCE\n\nso he waits til like 5AM\n\nand he goes over to Allison\u2019s window\n\nand he starts serenading the FUCK out of that window\n\nand Allison goes over to the window like FUCK BALLS WHAT DO YOU WANT\n\nand Absalon is like I WANT YOUR BODY ALL OVER MY BODY\n\nand Allison is like EW NO\n\nI DON\u2019T WANT YOUR VAN-HALEN-LOOKIN\u2019 ASS ANYWHERE NEAR MY ASS\n\nHAVE YOU EVEN SEEN MY ASS\n\nPEOPLE HAVE OFFERED TO PAY ME MONEY\n\nTO EAT PUDDING OFF OF IT\n\nPUDDING, OK\n\nand Absalon is like OKAY FINE\n\nWELL CAN I AT LEAST GET A KISS?\n\nand Allison is like WILL YOU GO THE FUCK HOME?\n\nand Absalon is like OK SURE\n\nso he busts out a ladder he brought specifically for this purpose\n\nand he climbs up to the window\n\nand it\u2019s really dark, you gotta understand\n\nso he gets up there and he puckers his lips\n\nand Allison proceeds to stick her ASS out the window\n\nand Absalon starts making out with her pungent hole\n\nand then he\u2019s like hey wait a second\n\nwomen don\u2019t have \u2026 beards\n\nAW SHIT\n\nand Allison is like TEE HEE\n\nand then slams the window in his face\n\nand goes back to banging Nicholas\n\nso now Absalon is FURIOUS\n\nlike, real furious\n\nthis is dangerous\n\nthis is a dangerous game now\n\nhe\u2019s ready to KILL someone\n\nor at least seriously maim them\n\ncause see what he does\n\nis he goes over to this blacksmith\u2019s place, right\n\nand the blacksmith is like yo Absalon\n\nwhat\u2019s your van-halen-lookin\u2019 ass doing in here at 5 o\u2019clock in the damn morning?\n\nand Absalon is like NO TIME TO EXPLAIN\n\nLET ME BORROW YOUR RED HOT IRON REAL QUICK\n\nand then he just grabs that shit and runs out of the store\n\nand he goes back to Allison\u2019s window\n\nand he\u2019s like HEY\n\nHEY\n\nOPEN THE FUCK UP\n\nI BROUGHT YOU MY GRANDMA\u2019S RING\n\nI WILL TRADE IT WITH YOUR TAWDRY SELF IN EXCHANGE FOR MORE KISSES\n\nand this time it\u2019s Nicholas who hears him\n\ncause see he just got up to take a piss\n\nso he makes his voice all high and he goes like COMING, HONEY\n\nand he goes over to the window\n\nand he sticks his narrow scholar ass out the window\n\nand Absolon climbs all the way up there\n\nand Nicholas rips the NASTIEST FUCKING FART\n\nlike BLURRRTTTTTTTTTTTTT\n\nand Absolon is almost blown off the damn ladder\n\n[THIS IS LITERATURE GUYS. THIS IS FUCKING LITERATURE]\n\nbut he\u2019s got his red hot iron ready this time\n\nand he just jabs Handsy Nick right in his flapping asshole\n\nand Nick\u2019s taint catches on fire\n\nand he runs into the house like WATER\n\nWATER\n\nHOLY SHIT\n\nWATER\n\nand John\n\nwho is still in the shed waiting for judgement day\n\nhears Nick yelling and is like WATER?\n\nHOLY SHIT THE FLOOD HAS COME\n\nand he takes the axe\n\nand severs the ropes\n\nand plummets to the floor and breaks his arm\n\nand the whole town shows up\n\nand Nicholas is like hey guys\n\nlook at dumbass John the Carpenter\n\nhe thought there was going to be some kind of biblical flood\n\nhe was trying to make me and his wife go along with it\n\nbut luckily we were too busy banging or WHO KNOWS WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED\n\nand everyone makes fun of john forever\n\nalthough I think he still stays married to Allison\n\nso I don\u2019t know what Nicholas got out of this whole thing\n\nother than a scorched asshole\n\n\n\n\nbut uh, okay\n\nso the moral of the story?\n\nwell the moral of the story is that hot chicks make terrible wives\n\nand scholars make terrible friends\n\nso maybe you\u2019re better off just being gay\n\nbecause at least then it\u2019s not a TOTAL loss\nif you find yourself making out with some dude\u2019s asshole at 5:00 in the morning\n\n\n\n    stolen from: http://bettermyths.com/the-miller-is-one-drunk-motherfucker/\n",

One day he took his questions to his mother, who became rather flustered. Instead of explaining things to Johnny, she told him to hide behind the curtains one night and watch his older sister and her boyfriend. This he did. The following morning, Johnny described everything to his mother.\n\n\u201cSis and her boyfriend sat and talked for a while, then he turned off most of the lights. Then he started kissing and hugging her. I figured sis must be getting sick because her face started looking funny. He must have thought so too, because he put his hand inside her blouse to feel her heart, just like the doctor would. Except, he\u2019s not as smart as the doctor, because he seemed to have trouble finding her heart. I guess he was getting sick too, because pretty soon both of them started panting and getting all out of breath. His other hand must have been cold, because he put it under her skirt. About this time, sis got worse, and began to moan and sigh and squirm around and slide down the end of the couch. This was when the fever started. I knew it was a fever because sis told him she was really hot.\n\nFinally, I found what was making them so sick\u2026. a big eel had gotten inside his pants somehow\u2026 it jumped out of his pants and stood there, about ten inches long. Honest. anyway he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from getting away.\n\nWhen sis saw it, she got really scared\u2026 her eyes got big, and her mouth fell open and she started calling out to God and stuff like that. She said it was the biggest one she\u2019s ever seen; I should tell her about the one down at the lake! Anyway, sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by biting it\u2019s head off. All of a sudden, she made a noise and let the eel go. I guess it bit her back. Sis then grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eel\u2019s head to keep it from biting again.\n\nSis then laid back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor lock on its head, he helped by lying on top of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a fight. Sis started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squashing it between them. After a while, they both quit moving and gave a great sigh. Her boyfriend got up, and sure enough they had killed the eel. I knew it was dead, because it just hung there, limp and some of its insides was hanging out. Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired form the battle, but they went back to courting anyway. He started hugging and kissing her again. By golly, the eel wasn\u2019t dead! It jumped straight up and started to fight again. I guess eels are like cats\u2026.they have nine lives or something.\n\nThis time, sis jumped up and tried to kill the eel by sitting on it. After a 36 minute struggle, they finally killed the eel. I knew it was dead because i saw sis boyfriend peel its skin off and flush it down the toilet\u201d. By this time, Johnny\u2019s mother had passed out cold.",

The corn flake was sad, so he looked online to see how he could get frosted. There was a frosting machine in his town, but it was pretty expensive. So he worked and worked to afford the frosting. After 6 months he had enough spare change to be able to get half frosted. He went to the place in town to get frosted and had it done. He was only half frosted, but the next company party he went to the other corn flake and tried to talk to her. Again, she said \"I said, I only talk to fully frosted corn flakes. Go away.\" So again, for 6 months he worked hard at his Walmart job. Then he could afford full frosting. So he went to the frost machine and had it done. He was a glorious fully frosted corn flake then. At the company party he found the girl and again, tried to talk to her.  She said \"Oh, hello Mr. Frosty. You look nice and frosty today.\" The corn flake replied \"Hey. Can I get you anything to drink? Maybe a water?\"\n\"Sure\" she said. so he went to find the line for the water. He came back moments later, saying \"They're out of water. Anything else?\"\n\"I dont know, maybe some orange juice?\" she said. So he went to find the orange juice. But the line was too long. \"Anything else I can get you?\" He said to her. \"Can I have some fruit punch?\" She asked. So he went to find the fruit punch. But then he realized....\n\nThere was no punch line.",

An attentive bagboy notices the woman's bemused expression and asks if there's a problem. \"Oh, I just forgot to get something important,\" the woman replies. The bagboy, eager to assist a pretty customer, politely offers to go and get for her whatever item she's forgotten. Quite embarrassed but in a hurry to leave, the young woman whispers to the bagboy, \"I need a box of Tampax\". \"No problem,\" he says, \"I'll be right back!\". The young woman is relieved and appreciates the help, as she waits at the register with a line forming behind her. Meanwhile, the bagboy has misunderstood the woman's shyly whispered request, and is now searching for a \"box of thumbtacks\". Eventually he finds the thumbtacks, but is confused by the different choices available. Imagine the young woman's reaction when the bagboy comes trotting back up to the register calling to her, \"Miss, do you want the kind that you push in, or the kind that you hammer in?\"\n",

The dad realizes the boy has swallowed the quarter and starts panicking, shouting for help. A well dressed, attractive, but serious looking woman in a blue business suit is sitting at a coffee bar in the market reading her newspaper and sipping a cup of coffee. At the sound of the commotion, she looks up, puts her coffee cup down on the saucer, neatly folds the newspaper and places it on the counter, gets up from her seat and makes her way, unhurried, across the market. Reaching the boy, the woman carefully takes hold of the boy's testicles and starts to squeeze, gently at first and then ever more firmly. After a few seconds the boy convulses violently and coughs up the quarter, which the woman deftly catches in her free hand. Releasing the boy, the woman hands the coin to the father and walks back to her seat in the coffee bar without saying a word. As soon as he is sure that his son has suffered no lasting ill effects, the father rushes over to the woman and starts thanking her saying, \"I've never seen anybody do anything like that before, it was fantastic. Are you a doctor?\" \"No,\" the woman replies. \"I work for the IRS.\"",

They ordered everyone in the town to evacuate immediately.\n\nA faithful Christian man heard the warning and decided to stay, saying to himself, \u201cI will trust God and if I am in danger, then God will send a divine miracle to save me.\u201d\n\nThe neighbors came by his house and said to him, \u201cWe\u2019re leaving and there is room for you in our car, please come with us!\u201d But the man declined. \u201cI have faith that God will save me.\u201d\n\nAs the man stood on his porch watching the water rise up the steps, a man in a canoe paddled by and called to him, \u201cHurry and come into my canoe, the waters are rising quickly!\u201d But the man again said, \u201cNo thanks, God will save me.\u201d\n\nThe floodwaters rose higher pouring water into his living room and the man had to retreat to the second floor. A police motorboat came by and saw him at the window. \u201cWe will come up and rescue you!\u201d they shouted. But the man refused, waving them off saying, \u201cUse your time to save someone else! I have faith that God will save me!\u201d\n\nThe flood waters rose higher and higher and the man had to climb up to his rooftop.\n\nA helicopter spotted him and dropped a rope ladder. A rescue officer came down the ladder and pleaded with the man, \"Grab my hand and I will pull you up!\" But the man STILL refused, folding his arms tightly to his body. \u201cNo thank you! God will save me!\u201d\n\nShortly after, the house broke up and the floodwaters swept the man away and he drowned. It's a real shame he didn't let himself be saved because God doesn't exist.",

The zookeeper agrees to the conditions and asks about the third.\n\nWell, says the janitor, I'm gonna need another week to come up with the $500.\n\nCredit to /u/Bic_Parker for the joke.",

Before the blonde could shut the door, the brunette yelled out, \"Be sure to be in and out in no more than 5 minutes!\" The blonde ran inside and the brunette waited in the car... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. Finally, the blonde bursts out of the bank's doors, the alarm blaring loud enough to wake everyone up. The blonde was lugging a bank safe behind her by a rope tied around it. A security guard ran out of the bank, his pants down around his ankles and attempting to reach his gun. The blonde breathed heavily as she tried to put the safe in the car but finally just gave up and left the safe behind. She ran into the passenger seat and pulled the door shut, the car already moving. The security guard yelled, \"Stop! Stop!\" while the pair drove off, leaving the safe with rope tied tightly around it behind. The brunette frantically asked the blonde, \"What the hell happened in there?!?\" The blonde was panting and turned to the brunette and choked out, \"What do you mean? I followed the plan exactly!\" The brunette paused and yelled, \"YOU IDIOT! YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO TIE UP THE GUARD AND BLOW THE SAFE!\"",

Then I looked around saw that all the staff had spoons in their pockets.\n\nWhen the waiter came back to serve our soup I asked, \"Why the spoon?\" Well,\" he explained, \"the restaurant's owners hired Kurt Salmon Associates to revamp all our processes. After several months of analysis, they concluded that the spoon is the most frequently dropped utensil. It represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour. If our personnel are better prepared, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift.\"\nAs luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he was able to replace it with his spare. \"I'll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now.\" I was impressed.\n\nI also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the waiter's fly. Looking around, I noticed that all the waiters had the same string hanging from their flies. So before he walked off, I asked the waiter, \"Excuse me, but can you tell me why you have that string right there?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly!\" Then he lowered his voice. \"Not everyone is so observant. That consulting firm I mentioned also found out that we can save time in the restroom. By tying this string to the tip of you know what, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the restroom by 76.39%.\"\n\n\"After you get it out, how do you put it back?\"\n\nWell,\" he whispered, \"I don't know about the others, but I use the spoon.\"\n\nCredit to u/LXIV",

But business wasn't going too well and so Mr. Pages decided to hire a advertisement company. And so he did...\n\nA couple of days went by and when Mr. Pages was walking to his store one morning, he saw a big billboard depicting Jesus hanging from his cross, and in big letters above it: \"With nails from Mr Pages, you hang for ages.\"\n\n\"OMG!\", screamed Mr. Pages, as he rushed to his store to call the advertisement company. On the phone with the designer of the billboard: \"You can't possibly be serious about this!\", he yelled at the guy, \"I will lose all my customers!\"\n\n\"Calm down\", the guy said, \"I will fix it emediately.\" So the designer, a bit frustrated because he thought the Jesus thing was a good idea, started working on a new concept.\n\nThe next morning Mr. Pages was walking to his store again and looked up at the billboard hoping the advertisement was changed. He was flabbergasted, as now Jesus was lying in a little bundle under his cross and the text above it read: \"He has teared of, but nails from Mr. Pages are still tough!\"\n\nSteaming with rage, Mr. Pages ran to his shop and called the advertisement company again. \"That's it!\" he said \"Our deal is off! I want nothing to do with your company anymore! I want this billboard removed and I'm not paying you either!\" and hung up the phone.\n\nThe designer, now also pissed off, not in the least because he wasn't getting payed for the work he already done.\n\nThe next morning Mr. Pages was eager to see the billboard removed. Instead, there was a big white canvas, and written in huge black letters: \"At Mr Pages their all Jews, but they have good screws!\"",

The night was rolling on and no car went by. The storm was so strong he could hardly see a few feet ahead of him. Suddenly he saw a car slowly coming towards him and stopped. John, desperate for shelter and without thinking about it, got in the car and closed the door, just to realize there was nobody behind the wheel and the engine wasn't on!\n\nThe car started moving slowly. John looked at the road and saw a curve approaching. Scared, he started to pray, begging for his life. Then, just before he hit the curve, a hand appeared through the window and turned the wheel. John, paralysed with terror, watched how the hand appeared every time they came to a curve. John saw the lights of a pub down the road so, gathering strength, jumped out of the car and ran to it. Wet and out of breath, he rushed inside and asked for two shots of tequila. He then started telling everybody about the horrible experience he went through. A silence enveloped everybody when they realized he was crying and.... wasn't drunk.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later, two guys walked into the same pub. They were also wet and out of breath. Looking around and seeing John Bradford sobbing at the bar, one said to the other, \"Look, Bruce.. there's the fucker that got in the car while we were pushing it.\n\n\nEdit: wow, this exploded.

No problem\"\n\nWell, Randy the rooster is a lot of money, but the farmer decides he'd be worth it, so, he buys Randy.

The lifeguard must have noticed because he yelled no cannon balls, then looked over at me very confused since I was dry, but everything got wet...even the cars in the parking lots 200 feet away.  Then the water started to turn red because the poop I took was so big. \n\n I then got scared and pissed but I was at the concession stand now...the cashier must have noticed because the vanilla snowcone I had just bought just turned into lemon flavor.  She took a bite because she was so confused.  She took one lick, looked me in the eyes, took off her clothes and fucked me there....I got scared and pooped my pants but this time it was inside her VAGINA!  And the snow cone was actually red now because she was color blind!    \n\nOk here is the punchline...I didn't poop inside her vagina, I pooped inside an asshole because it was a man cashier instead!  but double punchline...it was actually my own asshole!

Every Tuesday the nun goes to this graveyard to mourn her lost friend. What you need to do is go to the graveyard dressed up like a ghost and demand that she have sex with you. A couple guys do this every Tuesday and the nun always says yes and fucks them. Excited the guy says thank you and goes to a costume shop to get ready. Time passes and Tuesday comes by and the guy asks the nun on the bus will you fuck me? Which she says no. So Tuesday night rolls around and he puts on his ghost costume and goes to the graveyard the bus driver told him the nun goes to. There he waits for the nun to show up. An hour passes and the nun finally shows up. The guy jumps out from behind the graveyard and demands that the nun has sex with him. Scared the nun says yes and they finally fuck. Afterwards the guy takes off his costume and says I was the guy from the bus. The nun responds and says I'm the bus driver.",

I slam by tally-wacker against the bedpost seventeen times.\"\n\"Is that it?\" Asked Obama. \"That is all I have to do?\"\n\"That's it.\" Answered Bush. \"But don't hold back.

One...Thwack! Two...Thwack! Three... Thwack! Four...

St. Pete welcomes him and says that there is a new regulation now where a soul gets to choose if they want to go to heaven or hell. The soul must spend three days in hell and three days in heaven and after that he chooses where to go.\n\nThe man elects to get hell over with first and like that he *poof* vanishes and is transported to hell. He is greeted by lightly dressed, beautiful women, rivers of gold, alcohol, lust beyond all his dreams, a paradise of pleasure. Nothing at all like he was explained on earth. Everyday a new woman. Everyday the most succulent foods. Everyday just more and more bliss.\n\nAlas, though, his third day was up and like a flash *poof* he arrived in heaven. He was given wings and a harp. There was no river of gold, lust, women to fuck, the food was relatively bland. All and all, it was just meh.\n\nHis third day past, St. Pete appeared before him and asked where he wanted to spend eternity. The man says, \"St. Pete... I never thought I'd ever mutter these words, but I want to go to hell!\" St. Pete asked him if he was sure and as giddy as a school boy he gives a definitive yes.\n\nAnd just like that *poof* he arrives in hell. This time, though, he is shackled to a wall, on fire, and being disemboweled. It's never ending! In torturous pain constantly with no relief! It began to dawn on him that this would be his eternity.\n\nLater that day he sees Satan strolling by. Between his screams of agony and pain, the man yells, \"HEY SATAN!! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WOMEN, THE FOOD, THE LUST, THE HEAVEN THAT WAS HERE WHEN I VISITED!!!\"\n\nSatan replies, \"oh. You see when you visited I was campaigning. Today you voted!\"",

Of course, the professor knew of the problems and came up with a very intriguing proposition.  He said, while stroking his chin, \"Yeah, I can help you, but it is gonna take a little of you know what, if you know what I mean.\"  She, of course, knew what he meant.  She quickly thought about it and how she felt about it.  Rationalizing that her mom probably did something similar to get by she said, \"Yeah I can do that.\"  The professor told her to come closer so he could whisper into her ear.  She obliged and very carefully put her ear within whispering distance of the professor.  Feeling his hot breath he told her, \"D is for a little dick, C is for some Coochie, B is for Boobies because I am a Boob man and....\".  And right at that moment the professor's phone rang for which he immediately picked it up.  This was quite a relief for the student as it gave her time to think about her options.  Of course, she wanted the A and knew what this would require.  She knew she couldn't go home thinking that she didn't try her best to get an A and so resolved to go with that option.  The professor finished his phone call and hung up the phone.  The student immediately bent over and lifted her skirt so the professor could see her ass.  She said carefully fingered her butt letting him know what grade she wanted  He walked up behind her and unzipped his pants.  She bit down on her pencil and he put it in.

After hearing the man's symptoms and listening to his belly with a stethoscope the doctor told him that he had a tapeworm. ''Oh, is that bad? How can I get rid of it?'' asked the man. ''Come in tomorrow and bring a hard boiled egg and a lemon cookie,'' said the doctor. When he saw a puzzled look cross the man's face, the doctor said, ''Trust me. I'm the doctor.''\n\nSo, the next day the man brings in the hard boiled egg and the lemon cookie. ''Drop your pants, and bend over,'' says the doctor. ''What?'' says the man. ''Trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. So, the man drops his pants and bends over. SWOOSH! The doctor shoves the egg up his rear. ''Whoa! Hold on a minute, Jack!'' screams the man. ''Hold still and trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. \n\nAbout a minute later, SWOOSH! up goes the lemon cookie. ''Now pull up your pants and come back tomorrow with a hard boiled egg and a lemon cookie,'' says the doctor. As the infuriated man starts to protest the doctor says, ''Trust me. I'm the doctor.'' So, the man comes in the next day and he brings the hard boiled egg and the lemon cookie. ''Drop your pants and bend over,'' says the doctor. ''This again?'' yells the man. ''Trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. \n\nSo, the man drops his pants and bends over. SWOOSH! The doctor shoves the egg up his rear. ''Oh! I can't believe I'm doing this!'' says the man. ''Hold still now and trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. About a minute later, SWOOSH! up goes the lemon cookie. ''Now pull up your pants and come back tomorrow with another hard boiled egg and another lemon cookie,'' says the doctor. As the man starts to shake his head the doctor says, ''Trust me. I'm the doctor.'' So, this goes on all week until one day, after the man pulls up his pants, the doctor says, ''Now come in tomorrow and bring a hard boiled egg and a hammer.'' As the man turns pale the doctor says, ''Trust me. I'm the doctor.'' \n\nThe man gets no sleep that night worried to death about what the hammer is going to feel like when it gets shoved up in him. He almost stays home, but he still feels sick. So far the treatments haven't helped and he's afraid he'll have to start over if he goes to a new doctor. The man comes in the next day and he brings the hard boiled egg and the hammer. ''Drop your pants and bend over,'' says the doctor. ''But, why do we need a hammer?'' asks the man nervously. ''Trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. \n\nThe man drops his pants and bends over. SWOOSH! The doctor shoves the egg up his rear. ''Please!'' says the man, terrified of what is to come next. ''Hold still and trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. About a minute later, the man is about to pass out from terror and he is involuntarily clenching his rear as tight as he can. Then nothing happens. Several more minutes pass and he starts to relax. The man is about to straighten up and ask the doctor what happened when the tapeworm sticks its head out his rear and yells, ''Where's my lemon cookie?!'' And WHAM! Down comes the hammer.",

He enters the Italian litterature teacher\u2019s office and says: \u201cH-hi, t-teacherr, I\u2019m Gio-t-t-o\u2019shh fa-ther, is m-my s-shhon d-doing w-well?\u201d. The teacher looks at him with a disgusted face. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this man? He speaks like somebody whose tongue has been cut off!\u201d, he thinks. Still shocked, the teacher tells the man about Giotto: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but Giotto is a terrible student. He knows nothing about Italian litterature and during my lessons, I always see him drawing on his desk, paying no attention to me\u201d. Hearing these words, Giotto\u2019s father goes mad and starts uttering: \u201cW-what? T-thish i-issh sshameful! T-tonight I\u2019mm g-gonna t-teach him w-what the word d-dishhipline r-really meanssh!\u201d\nSo he leaves the room and goes to the math teacher\u2019s office. \n\u201cH-hi, t-teacherr, I\u2019m Gio-t-t-o\u2019shh fa-ther, is m-my s-shhon d-doing w-well?, he asks.\nThe math teacher doesn\u2019t believe his eyes. \u201cHow could this man end up speaking like this? I can hardly understand what he says as he keeps spitting all around the office!\u201d, he thinks. Then he answers the man\u2019s question: \u201cGiotto is a disaster, sir. He can barely count to 10 and whenever I look at him, I find him drawing on his desk\u201d. Giotto\u2019s father goes mad again and leaves the office. \u201cT-tonight I\u2019m t-teaching him a l-lesshhon!\u201d, he shouts.\nFinally, Giotto\u2019s father reaches the art teacher\u2019s office.\n\u201cH-hi, t-teacherr, I\u2019m Gio-t-t-o\u2019shh fa-ther, is m-my s-shhon d-doing w-well?\u201d.\nThe art teacher is shoked at first. \u201cWhat happened to this man?\u201d, he thinks. Then he smiles: \u201cYou\u2019re a very lucky father, sir! Your son is a genius! He draws like no other. I\u2019m sure he has a bright future ahead of him. Yesterday, for example, he painted a window on my classroom\u2019s wall. Outside the window you could see an amazing landscape wih hills, flowers, birds and even a river! It was so realistic that I tried to look out the window and I hit my head against the wall!\u201d, says the art teacher while pointing at a large patch on his forehead.\nGiotto\u2019s father seems to be unimpressed: \u201cW-Well\u201d, he says, \u201ct-that sshhhhon of a b-bitch! It wasshh worshhe f-for me! Two d-days ago he p-painted a pusshhy on the shhtove!\u201d\n",

Intrigued he decides to go check out the mine, and finds the walls absolutely glittering with silver. He rushes back to town and buys the mine, and then goes to the local hardware store to buy a pickax and a wheelbarrow. He then spends the next week going up to the mine every day, filling his wheelbarrow with silver, dumping the precious loot in his truck and driving back to town to sell the silver to the bank. After a week of hard work he has more money than he knows what to do with, so he decides he can afford to take on a little help. He puts out a help wanted ad for a day laborer, and soon enough he gets a call from an American Indian. The Indian says \"ad says you need worker. am strong worker, will work very hard.\" and the man hires him on.\n\n  For the next week the two of them work in the mine, the Indian picking away at the walls, and the young man dumping the wheel barrow in the truck and driving back into town to sell the silver. Another week's worth of money in the bank, the young man is feeling great. He gets a call from a Mexican answering his help wanted ad. He decides that he and the Indian have been working hard, and there's money to spare, why not take the Mexican on. He shows the Mexican around the mine and tells him that the Indian will work at the walls with the pickax, and that the Mexican will be dumping the full wheelbarrow in the truck for the young man to drive back into town to sell the silver. \"Es no problema, senor, si I dump the silver.\"\n\n  And so they went, the Indian picking the silver out of the walls of the mine, the Mexican wheeling the silver out of the mine and dumping it in the truck, and the young man driving back to town and selling the silver to the bank. Yet another week goes by and the team in the mine are going gangbusters. They're making money hand over fist and the young man is ecstatic. Then he gets a call from a Chinese man saying \"I see ad fo' worker. I rike work vely much. you pay me!\"\n  \n The man thinks it over, he really didn't think they needed more help, the Indian was doing great working the wall, the Mexican was running the wheelbarrow as fast as he could the second it was filled, and the man only had one truck to drive back into town. But, after a minute he told the Chinese man \"OK, I'll take you on. You can be in charge of the supplies. Whatever the Indian or the Mexican need, you get all the supplies, OK?\" \"OK,\" said the Chinese man, \"supplies, I do supplies.\"\n \n The next day the young man drove back into town to sell their most recent haul of silver, and when he came back he saw the Indian and the Mexican hard at work, but he couldn't find the Chinese man. He asked the Indian if he had seen him \"No,\" said the Indian \"I work wall. I do not see Chinese man today\". He asks the Mexican, and \"No senor. I no see no Chinese senor\". Confused the young man walks deeper and deeper into the mine looking for his most recent hire. It's getting darker the further into the mine he goes, and as he walks around a corner the Chinese man leaps out in front of him yelling **\"SUPPLIES!!\"**\n",

It just pops into your head. There's no warning that it's on the way; it's just there.

I understand he took to drinking right after we split up those many years ago, and I hear he hasn't been sober since.\" \n\"My God!\" I said, \"Who would think a person could go on celebrating that long?\" \nAnd then the fight started... \n________________________________ \n\nWhen our lawn mower broke and wouldn't run, my wife kept hinting to me that I should get it fixed. But, somehow I always had something else to take care of first, the shed, the boat, making beer.. Always something more important to me. Finally she thought of a clever way to make her point. \nWhen I arrived home one day, I found her seated in the tall grass, busily snipping away with a tiny pair of sewing scissors. I watched silently for a short time and then went into the house. I was gone only a minute, and when I came out again I handed her a toothbrush. I said, \"When you finish cutting the grass, you might as well sweep the driveway.\" \nThe doctors say I will walk again, but I will always have a limp. \n______________________________ \n\nMy wife sat down next to me as I was flipping channels. \nShe asked, \"What's on TV?\" \nI said, \"Dust.\" \nAnd then the fight started... \n________________________________ \n\nMy wife was hinting about what she wanted for our upcoming anniversary. \nShe said, \"I want something shiny that goes from 0 to 165 in about 2 seconds.\" \nI bought her a bathroom scale. \nAnd then the fight started...... \n______________________________ \n\nAfter retiring, I went to the Social Security office to apply for Social Security. \nThe woman behind the counter asked me for my driver's License to verify my age. \nI looked in my pockets and realized I had left my wallet at home. I told the woman that I was very sorry, but I would have to go home and come back later. \nThe woman said, 'Unbutton your shirt'. \nSo I opened my shirt revealing my curly silver hair. \nShe said, 'That silver hair on your chest is proof enough for me' and she processed my Social Security application. \nWhen I got home, I excitedly told my wife about my experience at the Social Security office. She said, 'You should have dropped your pants. You might have gotten disability too.' \nAnd then the fight started... \n________________________________ \n\nMy wife was standing nude, looking in the bedroom mirror. \nShe was not happy with what she saw and said to me, \n\"I feel horrible; I look old, fat and ugly. I really need you to pay me a compliment.' \nI replied, \"Your eyesight's damn near perfect.\" \nAnd then the fight started........ \n________________________________ \n\nI rear-ended a car this morning...the start of a REALLY bad day! \nThe driver got out of the other car, and he was a DWARF!! \nHe looked up at me and said 'I am NOT Happy!' \nSo I said, 'Well, which one ARE you then?' \nThat's how the fight started. \n",

The weatherman assured him that there was no chance of rain in the coming days. So the king went fishing with his wife, the queen. \n\n On the way he met a farmer on his donkey. Upon seeing the king the farmer said, \"Your Majesty, you should return to the palace at once because in just a short time I expect a huge amount of rain to fall in this area\". \n\n The king was polite and considerate, he replied: \"I hold the palace meteorologist in high regard. He is an extensively educated and experienced professional. Besides, I pay him very high wages. He gave me a very different forecast. I trust him and I will continue on my way.\" \n\n So he continued on his way. However, a short time later a torrential rain fell from the sky. The King and Queen were totally soaked...... and their entourage chuckled upon seeing them in such a shameful condition. Furious, the king returned to the palace and gave the order to fire the weatherman at once! Then he summoned the farmer and offered him the prestigious and high paying role of royal forecaster. \n\n The farmer said, \"Your Majesty, I do not know anything about forecasting. I obtain my information from my donkey. If I see my donkey's ears drooping, it means with certainty that it will rain.\" \n\n So the king hired the donkey. And so began the practice of hiring asses to work in the government, and ...occupy its highest and most influential positions..... and which later became the symbol for the Democrat party. \n\n Thus ends your knowledge lesson for today ",

The car is parked on the street in front of the bank; she has the title, and everything checks out. The bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. The bank\u2019s president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the blonde for using a $250,000 Rolls as collateral against a $5,000 loan. An employee of the bank then drives the Rolls into the bank\u2019s underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the blonde returns and repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, \u201cMiss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely; but we are a little puzzled. We checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is - why would you bother to borrow $5,000?\u201d The blond replies\u2026..\u201cWhere else in New York City can I park my car for two weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?\u201d",

I was considering calling him a retard, but wasn't quite sure if he was Polish or not and didn't want to offend him...he did not appear homosexual so I did not think it would offend.\n\nMy lawyer has advised me to claim I am homosexual in order to get this charge dropped...but he is telling me that simply claiming to be homosexual will not be enough.  This is all just so messed up because I have nothing against gay people and the person accusing me is the one that actually started the fight!\n\nHe wants me to stand in front of 12 jurors and receive anal sex from him.  I asked him if I could just perform oral on him but he told me that I cant because legally speaking he is a top.  \n\nI asked my lawyer how long this will last for, and he is telling me the longer the better.  He is saying it will be best if he reaches ejaculation, but is not quite sure if they will allow him to bring in anal beads and butt plugs as a witness....if he isn't allowed to bring them in he says our chances will only be 50/50.\n\nHe says that if we do lose that we will be able to have a retrial once I am in prison for awhile.  I asked why anything would be different then and why we couldn't just prove my innocence now...he stated that the main issue currently with the case is that I am not his type.  He said I was not adequately fit to stand the trial.....I said \"what?!  Then why are we going to trial!\" He apologized and meant that he was talking about my fitness and excess weight.  I broke into tears and he comforted me with a gentle kiss on the neck then explained to me that in prison I will surely obtain evidence within weeks of being there.  He explained that I would be going to a maximum security prison and that my chances of being raped were pretty high.  \n\nThe more I talk to him the more he seems disinterested....I think he is becoming less and less attracted to me.  He has already started giving me advice on how to get raped the fastest in prison.  He is telling me not to resist so it makes it look like it is consensual and to not shower afterwards...he is explaining that I may need to hold the ejaculate within my asshole for weeks until it can be processed in a lab.  He is telling me that once it happens it will be one of the greatest days of my life.  \n",

        "body": "Once-upon-a-time, there was a young woman who fell in love with a fish. This caused her parents some embarrassment when they went to church. When her father had found out he screamed \"What do you mean she's dating a fish!\".\n\n\"He's not an ordinary fish dear, he's one of those anthropomorphic fish, the kind that talk and take on human characteristics\"\n\n\"Does he have a job?\"\n\n\"Well no, but he reads a lot, and he's very polite. He's really a very nice boy dear.\"\n\n\"He's an unemployed fish!\"\n\n\"Whatever.\"\n\nEventually the young woman began to grow unsatisfied with the lack of sex in the relationship. She was also getting tired of him staying home all day and reading while she worked all day. The young woman decided to go to the witch who lived in the forest, and ask her to turn her fish into a man. So she took the fish to the witch.\n\n\"Well let's see here.\" the witch said, looking at the fish \"Very nice fish you got here, nice coloring. I'll take it, now what do you want?\" she asked the young woman.\n\n\"This fish and I have fallen in love and I want you to turn him into a man.\" the young woman replied.\n\n\"Is this true?\" the witch asked the fish.\n\n\"Yes ma'am\" smiled the fish.\n\n\"Did I do this?\" the witch asked the young woman.\n\n\"No, he was always a fish\"\n\n\"No, what I mean is did I make you fall in love with the fish? I have a few drinks now and then, and the next thing you know whole weeks are blacked out.\" the witch said.\n\n\"I don't think so.\" the young woman said.\n\n\"O.k., so if I turn this fish into a man, you go home with a man, and I get to keep the fish?\"\n\n\"If you turn the fish into a man, then there won't be a fish for you to keep, unless I'm missing something here.\" said the young woman with a quizzical look on her face.\n\n\"So we need to arrange another method of payment then?\" asked the witch.\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"Well o.k., did you bring any money dear?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I'm just a poor farm girl with no material possessions.\"\n\n\"I'll change the fish into a man after you have worked for me for a year.\"\n\nThe young woman agreed and went to work for the witch, sweeping, cooking, and sewing for the witch. Finally the year passed, and the witch turned the fish into a tall and handsome man. And so the young woman and the tall and handsome former fish lived happily until the tall and handsome former fish left the young woman for a barmaid with long legs and a learning disability.\n\nEventually the young woman found a young man who was slightly younger than her, but extremely gifted at oral sex and they settled down.\n\nShe often thought about the tall and handsome former fish and how stupid she was. She was thinking these every thoughts one day while she was fishing off the bridge. She felt something bite the hook, and she yanked the poll up. To her surprise, the fish called out to her \"Hey Baby!\"\n\n\"Not another one!\" she screamed.\n\n\"It's me baby. Don't you remember? We really had something special!\" said the fish.\n\n\"What happened to that barmaid you left me for?\" the young woman scowled.\n\n\"She left me, and when I wouldn't leave her alone, she got the witch to turn me back into fish.\" said the fish.\n\n\"Well come on dear let's take you to the witch and straighten this out.\" she said the fish. And so she took the fish to witch.\n\n\"Hello.\" said the witch as she answered the door.\n\n\"Do you remember me? I worked for you for a year so that you would turn this fish into a man. It seems another woman had you turn him back into a fish.\" the young woman said to the witch.\n\n\"Oh yes I remember, lovely fish.\" the witch said.\n\n\"Well I'd like to make another deal with you.\"\n\n\"What would you like dear?\"\n\n\"I'd like to you make my breasts bigger, and in exchange you can have the fish.\" the woman said to the witch.\n\n\"Baby! You can't do this to me, not after all we've meant to each other!\"\n\n\"Deal.\" said the witch.\n\nAnd so the young woman went home that evening without any fish, but her husband didn't seem to notice.\nRead more at: http://www.funzoned.com",

A bird pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely *not* Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.\n\nHowever, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analysing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with lorries, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car.\n\nAn Ornithological Behaviourist was sought to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.\n\nThe Ornithological Behaviourist very quickly concluded the cause: when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger.\n\nThe scientific conclusion was that while all the lookout crows could say \"Cah\", none could say \"Lorry.\"",

Looking around saw a restaurant neon flashing in mid daylight. Though, that'll do. \nWent in, and it was packed, except there was a chair empty at a table on the other end of the busy restaurant hall. On the other chair on that table, behold, its my boss, yelling at the waiter.

He looked upset, more than the usual, looked at me with a red face throbbing in anger, didn't say anything. Well, he did not say no, I took my chance and sat down. The waiter came and I asked him what he can bring me now, without waiting. He replied 'the special soup'. So be it, soup it is.\nI noticed that boss had not touched his soup, the same one I ordered and it is just sitting there. Looked at my watch and 6 minutes had already passed. Asked him if he was going to have that soup, I ordered the same and he could have mine which would arrive hot. Thought to my self the he must be aware of the meeting I'm presenting in.\nWell, here goes, I pulled bowl towards me again with as much politeness as I could manage. Amazingly my bosses expression remained absolutely unchanged. I started gobbling down the soup like there is no tomorrow. And as I reached the bottom of the bowl I could notice something there. Heck what ever, I kept at it and finally when I finished it all I could see that the object at the bottom of the bowl was a dead cockroach. Dear goodness, my stomach churned and almost in a single reflex all of what I just swallowed I puked back out onto the bowl drop for drop.\n\nAs I was reeling from it and began to process the information of what just happened, my boss spoke. \"That's right, I did exactly the same!\"",

After walking through the camping and fishing sections he ends up in the hunting supply section. He notices the trophy heads mounted on the wall and is drawn to the moose. Despite having never gone further then the subway map his entire life he decides he is going to go moose hunting. \n\nHe finds a Grizzly Adams looking employee at the store and tells the man \"I want everything I need to go moose hunting.\"\n\nAfter some questions Grizzly Adams realised this new hunter has lots of money but zero outdoor experience. He sells city boy 5 full outfits of hunting clothes, a high end tent and sleeping bag, camp stove and cooking gear and all the odds and ends needed for a week long stay in the woods. They make their way over to the firearm section and Grizzly sells the man the most expensive rifle they sell. \n\nLooking over his haul city boy asks \"so now that I have all this gear am I guaranteed I'll get a moose?\"\n\nGrizzly looks around to make sure no one was listening in and leaned in close to city boy. He quietly tells him he can guarantee the man gets a moose if he can keep quiet about a family hunting secret of his. City boy eagerly agrees and Grizzly takes him to the back room of the store. Grizzly produced a wooden box the size of a shoe box and puts it on the table in the centre of the room. City boy opens the box and the smell that came from the box nearly knocked him flat on his back. He looks at grizzly through his watering eyes and asks what the rancid stink has to do with moose hunting. \n\nGrizzly explains \"this box holds your secret weapon to guarantee you land a moose, the vagina from a female moose. Just put this on a string around your neck and you'll have a bull moose coming your way in no time.\"\n\nSatisfied with his haul, moose box and all, city boy pays for his gear and heads off to the wilderness to kill a majestic moose. \n\nAbout 2 weeks later Grizzly notices that same city boy walking in his store. City boy looks like he's been in a fight he has a black eye, his arm in a sling and cuts and scrapes on every bit of exposed skin he can see. As soon as city boy sees Grizzly stomps right over to him points in his face and yells \"you son of a bitch I'm going to sue you and take everything you have!\"\n\nConfused, Grizzly asks the man what's the problem. City boy gets right in his face and yells \"you never sold me any bullets for that gun. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN FUCKED BY A MOOSE!?!?\"",

The tribe immediately took them as prisoners and tied them to stakes.    \nThe chief says to them, \"If your penises can measure a total of 12 inches, we will let you go. If not, you will be killed and eaten.\"    \nThe men grew immediately nervous, as one of the tribesmen pulls down the first guys pants. 4 inches. They begin to sweat. The tribesman pulls down the next guy's pants. It's like a baby's arm. 7 inches. Breathing a massive sigh of relief, they all look to the last guy, who's breathing heavy and with worry on his face, as his pants are removed. 1 inch.    \nThe guys cheer as they're being untied and are walking out of the camp. As they finally make their way out of the jungle and laughing to themselves at the insanity of the situation, the third guy looks at the other two and says, \"Man. I'm really glad I had a boner.\"",

So he went to the maid's room.  When he looked through the maid's room keyhole, he saw his dad having sex with his maid.  Little Johnny was surprised, but then he just realized somethingand thinks aloud,  \"OH!! Now I understand the government!

On her way home, she stops at a news-stand to buy a newspaper. Before leaving, she says to the salesgirl, \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind me asking, but how old do you think I am?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout 22,\u201d is the reply.\nHot blonde\n\u201cNope! I\u2019m exactly 40,\u201d the woman replies with a big smile.\nA little while later she goes into McDonald\u2019s and asks the counter girl the very same question.\nThe girl replies, \u201cI\u2019d guess about 21.\u201d\nThe woman says happily, \u201cNope, I\u2019m 40. I guess I look so much younger, right? Hehe.\u201d\nNow she\u2019s feeling really good about herself. While waiting for the bus to go home, she asks an old man waiting next to her the same question.\nHe replies, \u201cLady, I\u2019m 68 and my eyesight is not so good. Although, when I was young, there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was. It sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra. Then, and only then I can tell you EXACTLY how old you are. You want to let me try?\u201d\nThey wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the best of her. She finally blurts out, \u201cWhat the hell, go ahead.\u201d\nThe old man immediately slips both his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and gentlely. He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently rubs each nipple. He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other too!\nAfter a few more minutes of this, she says, \u201cOkay, okay\u2026How old am I?\u201d\nHe completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, \u201cMadam, you are 40.\u201d\nStunned and amazed, the woman says, \u201cThat was incredible, how could you tell?\u201d\nThe old man says, \u201cPromise you won\u2019t get mad?\u201d\n\u201cI promise I won\u2019t.\u201d she says.\n\u201cI was behind you in line at McDonald\u2019s.\u201d ",

LISTEN, I NEED YOU TO SELL YOUR BUSINESS.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, of course, God!\"  Joe said, ecstatic that God was speaking to him.

They just laugh at him and tell him to go try one of the other branches. He heads over to the air force, they tell him it's not going to happen but maybe he'll have better luck with the navy. He tries them and gets told that they are desperate but not THAT desperate, he should go try his luck with the Army.  So he heads over to the army recruiters and sure enough, they sign him right up.\n\nThe kid starts his training and when the time comes to be assigned their riffles he is the last one in line. By time he gets to the front they are all out of guns. The guy handing out the guns hands the kid a broom instead. The retarded kid asks him what he is suppose to do with a broom and the army guy tells him, \"Well son, this is a magic broom. When you see the Germans comin, just point your broom at them and say 'banga banga banga' and they'll all fall over dead.\" So the kid takes his broom and leaves. The next day they are handing out bayonet's and again, the kid is the last one in line. When he gets to the front they give him a piece of string. Again the kid asks what he is suppose to do with a piece of string. The army guy ties it to his broom and tells him. \"Well, if the Germans get too close, just move your broom back and forth and say 'slishidy slash, slishidy slash' and they'll fall over dead. \n\nTime passes and the kid finally finds himself on the front line facing the German army. He points his broom at them and starts saying 'banga banga banga' and sure enough, the Germans start falling over dead. A little while later and the Germans are still advancing, now they are right on top of the American forces. The kid starts swinging his broom from side to side saying 'slishidy slash, slishidy slash' and again the Germans start falling over dead. A little more time passes and the kid sees the biggest German he has ever seen coming over the hill. He points his broom at him and says 'banga banga banga' but nothing happens, the German keeps coming right at him. The kid starts swinging his broom back and forth and saying 'slishidy slash, slishidy slash' but again nothing happens. The German keeps coming, runs right into the kid, knocks him over. As the kid is being smashed into the mud he looks up and the last thing he hears is the German saying \"Tankady tankady tankady\". ",

Next, Buddy here *points to the chihuahua* is trained to run right up to that gorilla and bite him square in nuts.  When the gorilla puts his hands down to protect himself, you slap the cuffs on him and I'll take him away in the truck.\"             \n           \nFred: \"Well, I never would have guessed it, but that actually sounds like a great plan.  But wait, what's the shotgun for?\"            \n          \nBob's casual demeanor drops, and suddenly he is deathly serious when he says: \"If I fall off that ladder, you shoot that Fucking Dog.\"",

So he took his costume and away he went.\n\nThe wife, after sleeping soundly for one hour, awakened without pain, and as it was still early, she decided to go to the party. In as much as her husband did not know what her costume was, she thought she would have some fun by watching her husband to see how he acted when she was not with him.\n\nShe joined the party and soon spotted her husband cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing with every nice chick he could, and copping a little feel here and a little kiss there. His wife sidled up to him and being a rather seductive babe herself, he left his partner high and dry and devoted his time to the new stuff that had just arrived\n\nShe let him go as far as he wished; naturally, since he was her husband. Finally he whispered a little proposition in her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the cars and messed around.\n\nJust before unmasking at midnight, she slipped away and went home and put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of explanation he would make for his behavior.\n\nShe was sitting up reading when he came in and asked what kind of a time he had. He said, \"Oh, the same old thing. You know I never have a good time when you're not there.\"\n\nThen she asked, \"Did you dance much?\"\n\nHe replied, \"I'll tell you, I never even danced one dance. When I got there, I met Pete, Bill Brown and some other guys, so we went into the den and played poker all evening.

In the mean time, well, there isn't much, but if you want to amuse yourself, i can help you with that.\"\n\nThe engineer thinks for a moment, and then says, \"You know, it is extremely hot down here. I'd love to build a large AC unit. Do you have the materials?\"\n\nSatan says, \"Well, yes, we have all manners of metals due to our location under the Earth's crust. Have at it.\"\n\nThe engineer, after 3 days of heavy work, finishes his Hell-wide AC and turns it on. After 3 hours, the temperature has finally reached a more desirable 78 degrees, and Hell is much less hellish. Satan is highly impressed. \"Nice work, i didn't think this was even possible! Sorry to say, though, St. Peter refuses to admit he messed up. Since you made this AC happen, I'll let you do whatever you want.\"\n\nThe engineer thinks, and says, \"You now it's also really dark and dim with just the lava flows. Have the materials for a lighting system?\" Satan says, \"Of course! God sent some heavenly light once but i never could figure out how it worked. Here's the instructions.\"\n\n2 days later, the heavenly light had been configured to brightly light Hell. Productivity was way up and now Hell was not so bad anymore. Satan tells the engineer,  \"I like you, bud! Tell you what, you can live like a king. Got a room in my castle for you. Everything you could ever want is there.\"\n\nAt this point, several angels had reviewed the engineer's life and informed God of St. Peter's mistake. God hastily adds the engineer to the Heaven list. He calls Satan and asks for the engineer. \n\nSatan says, \"No way, man! Hell has never been so nice before him. We have lighting, cooling, and now he's tinkering with machines that haven't worked since your son went to Earth! I'm keeping him.\"\n\nGod immediately responds, \"He is a good man, though! He belongs in Heaven. It is only right! If you will not return him, I'll have to take you to court.\"\n\nSatan laughs, and says, \"Oh, and just where will you find a lawyer?\"",

You came home and ate in two minutes, and went straight to sleep after watching the game. You don't tell me you love me anymore, you don't touch me or anything. Either you're cheating or you don't love me anymore, whatever the case is. I'm gone.\n\nP.S. If you're trying to find me, don't. Your BROTHER and I are moving away to West Virginia togetherl\n\nHave a great lifel > Your EX-Wife\n\n***************************************\n\nDear Ex-Wife\n\nNothing has made my day more than receiving your letter. It's true that you and I have been married for seven years, although a good woman is a far cry from what you've been. I watch sports so much to try to drown out your constant nagging. Too bad that doesn't work. I did notice when you cut off all of your hair last week, the first thing that came to mind was \"You look just like a man!\" My mother raised me to not say anything if you can't say anything nice.\n\nWhen you cooked my favorite meal, you must have gotten me confused with MY BROTHER, because I stopped eating pork seven years ago. I went to sleep on you when you had on that new negligee because the price tag was still on it. I prayed that it was a coincidence that my brother had just borrowed fifty dollars from me that morning and your negligee was $49.99.\n\nAfter all of this, I still loved you and felt that we could work it out. So when I discovered that I had hit the lotto for ten million dollars, I quit my job and bought us two tickets to Jamaica.\n\nBut when I got home you were gone. Everything happens for a reason I guess.\n\nI hope you have the fulfilling life you always wanted. My lawyer said with your letter that you wrote, you won't get a dime from me. So take care.\n\nP.S. I don't know if I ever told you this but Carl, my brother was born Carla. I hope that's not a problem.\n\nSigned",

As a sophomore, he was 6'7\" 230, super athletic and was a star in any sport he played, but he loved basketball the most. One night he was out celebrating after a win and his buddy was driving drunk and wrecked. Ron wasn't wearing his seat belt and was thrown from the vehicle. He suffered a lot of serious injuries, but what was devastating was that they had to amputate his arms as they had nearly ripped off from rolling on the pavement. The whole community was so devastated because everyone had such high hopes for him and his future. \nRon was a determined kid though and he vowed to play basketball again. \n\nAfter almost a year of PT and countless hours in his driveway with his dad practicing, he learned how to headbutt the ball into the basket, and utilize his long legs and strong torso to play defense. Needless to say, we all kinda chuckled (not in a mean way, we're not savages) when he said he was going to try out for the team again. His determined look told us he wasn't kidding, so we went to his tryout to see how he'd do. We were shocked to see the agility he had, and his precise \"header shots\" as he called them. He actually beat me 1 on 1 later that day in a pick up game. I wasn't a standout, but I could generally hold my own against similar competition. He had these really small stubs that he used to dribble and I have no clue how he pulled the rest off. \n\nAnyways, we were playing in our final game of the year, if we won we'd go to states to compete and everyone was nervous. Ron was simply amazing that game. He put up over 30 points and had 12 assists but towards the end of the game we were only up by 1 point. There were only 7 seconds left on the clock and the opposing team was in-bounding the ball. Somehow the guy I was guarding ran around a screen and I tripped giving him a wide open lane to the basket. I felt sick. The ball immediately went to him and as he drove to the hoop we all see Ron flying across the court. As he pulls his arm up to lay the ball in, Ron dropkicks this kid right into the padding behind the hoop. It was one of the dirtiest plays I've ever seen. The kid goes flailing, the ball bounces awkwardly off the rim and his the ground and the time expires. The whole gymnasium was silent waiting to hear the ref's whistle and see the free throws that would surely tie or end the game, but only the subtle chatter of the refs could be heard followed by a quick whistle to signal the end of the game. \n\nThat's when he lost it. The other coach was vehemently screaming at the top of his lungs, flailing his arms, kicking chairs, making a mess, but the ref just looked at him and shook his head and uttered the phrase I'll always remember. The one that sealed our victory, \"Sorry coach, No arm, no foul\".\n ",

His grandma asked him how he was doing, what college was like, etc. and the kid replied \"Its great, but I'd love some more of what we talked about before.\n\nShe replied, \"Have you been reading your Bible however?\"\n\nThe kid replied, \"Of course! I'm on chapter 4!\"\n\nThe grandma sighed, and said goodbye.\n\nA few more months passed by, and the kid was doing great in college, but money was starting to get tight.  He called his grandma in a panic and asked her, \"Grandma, I really need money, college is great, and I want to graduate, but to do that I need more money.\"\n\nThe Grandma once again asked, \"Have you been reading your Bible?\"\n\nThe son responded \"Yes, its great, I wish it was longer!\"\n\nAgain, the grandma sighed, and said goodbye.\n\nFinally, the time for graduation rolled around, but even though the kid had all As, he had to drop out since he had no more money left.  He was in tears, and saw that his grandma was calling.  He picked up and said hello.\n\n\"I heard you're dropping out of school, why is that?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know grandma, maybe its because I don't have any money because you won't give any to me!\"\n\nThe grandma, exhausted, asked \"Have you read your Bible yet?\"\n\nThe kid, in frustration, hung up the phone.  As he cried, he began packing up his room, and the final thing he put away was the Bible.  For the first time at college, he actually opened the Bible, and inside, in a hole cut out in the book was an envelope.  He opened the envelope and inside was a handwritten note from his grandma.

Only this night was different, on the bar, sat somebody new.\n\nA woman so beautiful, so elegant, he had to fall in love with her. This was the girlfriend he was looking for, the girl he dreamed about for sure!\n\nHe saunters over toward the girl in the smokey room and asks \"How's it going?\". The girl looks flustered and says \"It's a little smokey in here...\", red faced, she was literally glowing.\n\nSo he said unto her, \"Don't worry maam, I'll sort out this stuff\", and sucked all the smoke in the room up with one big huff.\n\nHe walked outside, blew the smoke out; and walked back in and stood next to her, with a proud little pout.\n\nAmazed, she asked \"How did you do that?\", pointing to his mouth with her hand.\n\nAnd he said \"Well my dear, it's not too hard, being an ex-tractor fan.\"",

The next day, Horatio the Physician made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's brassiere while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense.\n\nUpon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio the Physician informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick the Dragon Slayer would work as the antidote to cure the itch.\n\nThe King quickly summoned Nick the Dragon Slayer. Horatio the Physician then slipped Nick the Dragon Slayer the antidote for the itching powder, which he quickly put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's voluptuous and magnificent breasts.\n\nThe Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick the Dragon Slayer left satisfied and touted as a hero.\nUpon returning to his chamber, Nick the Dragon Slayer found Horatio the Physician demanding his payment of thousand gold coins.\n\nWith his obsession now satisfied, Nick the Dragon Slayer couldn't have cared less and, knowing that Horatio the Physician could never report this matter to the King, with a laugh just told him to get lost.\nThe next day, Horatio the Physician slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick the Dragon Slayer...\n\nContinued......",

There, in the corner, there\u2019s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo the guy asks the bartender, \u201cWhere\u2019d he come from?\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThere\u2019s a genie in the men\u2019s room who grants wishes.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo the guy runs into the men\u2019s room and, sure enough, there\u2019s this genie. And the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d So the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cO.K., I wish for world peace.\u201d And there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and then the room fills up with geese.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo the guy walks out of the men\u2019s room and he\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo the guy processes this. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cDoes that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cYeah. Why, what did you wish for?\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWorld peace.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo the bartender is understandably ashamed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it\u2019s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI feel like I should explain myself further.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s just grab a beer.

If you looked hard enough, you could see that there were cracks all over the walls, from previous failed attempts at escape. The hope to escape had long fled the hearts of those surrounding Fue, but he was special, he was a survivor. Fue was a brilliant boy, and studied mechanical engineering his whole life, so that one day he could taste the sweetness of victory. Fue was able to feed his insatiable desire to escape by working in the scrapyard near his small hut in the encampment. He spent years on a secret project that he knew would one day lead him to freedom. After 10 years of hard work, Fue lancaster finished his project, a remarkable, and heavily armed jet fighter. He proudly looked upon his creation and decided he should name it after himself. It wasn't long after that fue took flight, and headed towards the wall. With the press of a small red button, the roaring of the flight engines on the missiles could be heard for miles. With the loudest boom fue  had ever heard, he saw the wall crumble. He felt a new sensation in his face and realized that he was smiling for the first time. That smile soon faded when fue realized that the center of the wall was made of solid steel! With a mighty yawp, fue blasted roaring flames at the treacherous metal keeping him from his one desire of freedom. His yell did not stop until there was no more fire left. His heart raced as he waited for the smoke to clear. All of a sudden, his heart broke into a million pieces, and it was in that moment, that he realized, that Jet Fue L can't melt steel beams",

He asked, \"Rabbi, everyone has been going crazy in this town, and the next, and cities near and far. Why is life like a wheel of cheese?\"\n\nThe great rabbi thinks for a moment, then shrugs his shoulders and says \"eeeehh... ok, maybe it's not like a wheel of cheese.\"",

He is barely able to walk and his back is so hunched he can barely look up at the priest. The old man walks up to the priest and says;\n\n\"Father, please help me. I am an old, tired, and feeble man. All I want is a purpose and a bed to sleep in. Is there anything I can do for your church? Any way I can be of some help to someone?\"\n\nThe priest looked down at the sad old man with pity in his heart and said;\n\n\"My son, it grieves me to see one of God's children in such a state. Of course you are welcome to stay here, but you need not work to earn your keep.\"\n\nTo which the old man replied;\n\n\"But Father, I seek a job, a purpose, something to give my remaining time some meaning.\"\n\nThe priest thought, then said;\n\n\"Well, it's not much, but we do need a new bell ringer, though I fear it may be to strenuous a task for you.\"\n\nThe old man said;\n\n\"I'll do it. Please just give me a chance.\"\n\nSo the priest lead the old man to the top if the bell tower, showed him how to pull the ropes to ring the gigantic bells, and showed him the bed for him there in the tower.\n\n\"You can stay here. We will bring you food everyday and all you must do is ring the bell every hour, on the hour, the appropriate number of times,\" The priest said.\n\nThe old man thanked him and the priest returned down stairs.\n\nAs the first hour drew near, the priest began to worry. He thought of the man's hunched back and his twisted arms, and began to doubt the man would be able to ring the huge bell. But sure enough, when the hour came, the bell rang loudly and clearly and the appropriate number of times.\n\nFor the next few days, the priest worries lessened as the bell continued to ring perfectly every time.\n\nOne night, as the priest sat reading in his study, he began to be curious about how the broken old man was doing it. He had been so sure the man's wilted body would not be capable of exerting the effort required to ring the great bell.\n\nSo, near the hour of 9, he quietly went up the tower to watch. As the time grew near, he watched the man get up from his bed and stand facing the bell at a few paces. The man checked the clock and when the hour hit 9 exactly he charged face first into the bell, creating a resonant, clear ring. The man repeated this eight more times, ringing the bell with his own face each time.\n\nThe priest watched in horror, but when the old man finished and turn back to his bed, among the bruises and cuts on the man's face, there was a giant smile. He was so happy to have a purpose and home that he almost didn't feel the pain.\n\nThe priest returned downstairs, worried, but unsure what to do. He decided that he would let the man continue, but he would make sure to check on him more often.\n\nFinally, Sunday came and the church was full of people. The priest gave his sermon and listened as the bell rang proudly in the middle of it. An hour after that, during a hymn, the bell began to ring again, but, unlike any time before it, the bell stopped two rings short of the proper number.\n\nThe priest was worried by this, but was unable to stop the service, and knew it would be over soon. \n\nAfter the service, he was heading for the base of the tower when he heard a great deal of noise coming from outside. He was worried about the old man, but felt he needed to check outside first.\n\nWhen he got outside, he saw a huge crowd of people near the base of the tower, all focused on something on the ground in the middle of the group. He quickly made his way through the crowd to the middle, only to find the broken body of the old man lying there in a heap.\n\nThe priest assumed the man, in one of his mad charges at the bell, had missed and tumbled from the tower to the ground below.\n\n\"Father, did you know this man?\" someone asked.\n\n\"No\" said the priest, \"but his face rings a bell.\"",

Jack sits up and sees his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed. He takes the aspirins, cringes when he sees a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror.\n\nThen he notices a note hanging on the corner of the mirror written in red with little hearts on it and a kiss mark from his wife in lipstick: \"Honey, breakfast is on the stove, I left early to get groceries to make your favorite dinner tonight. I love you, darling! Love, Jillian\" He stumbles into the kitchen and sure enough, there is a hot breakfast, steaming hot coffee, and the morning newspaper all waiting for him.\n\nHis son is also at the table, eating. Jack asks, \"Son\u2026 what happened last night?\"\n\n\"Well, you came home after three in the morning, drunk and out of your mind. You fell over the coffee table and broke it, and then you threw-up in the hallway, and got that black eye when you ran into the door.\"\n\nConfused, he asked his son, \" So, why is your mother in such a good mood, and breakfast is on the table waiting for me?\"\n\nHis son replies, \"Oh THAT!

Eventually I pull the bottle out and says \"Okay, I'm ready to wish, genie.\"\n\n\"About fucking time,\" says the genie, \"it's cramped in there, what do you wish for?\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"I've given it some thought, and I have decided that money can in fact buy happiness, and so I will have one billion dollars, please.\"\n\nBAM! \"It is done,\" says the genie, \"what is your second wish?\"\n\n\"I don't know yet,\" said I, \"I'll get back to you.\"\n\nSo I and look at my bank balance, and sure enough, it's a billion dollars. I go and buy an mansion and a yacht and a harem and all sorts of expensive rich-person stuff and I live the life of luxury for months.

I negotiate world peace and invent whole new schools of thought. All the time I'm thinking, okay, what would be even better than this? What is the one thing I could wish for next that would make my life absolutely perfect? And eventually, I figure it out.\n\nI pull out out the bottle and say to the genie, \"Okay, it's third wish time.\"\n\n\"Fucking finally\", says the genie, \"what's it gonna be?

Turns out his name is Joseph, and he's here on vacation from some tropical place I didn't catch the name of (hence why he's so over dressed). Anyway, we make it to the top of the hill, and he suggests we go to the terrain park (with jumps and rails). I ask him if he's ever done that before and he says no, but that he'd like to try. I shrug my shoulders, tell him to be safe, and down the trail we go. Suddenly, he veers off and begins to take a rail on his skis. And wouldn't you know it, the armature is doing it! Yet all of a sudden, I see his ski slip, and he falls off the rail. I see his jacket explode in stuffing, blood starting to pool around his eyes. Poor guy must have hit his eye on the rail during the fall! I rush over to him to see if he's okay, but he quickly gets up, and stuffs a gob of the jacket stuffing in his eye. Then he just skis away! And to be honest, I don't know where he'd come from, I didn't know where he'd go, but all I knew was that he was Cotton-Eye Joe",

        "body": "Once upon a time, in a kingdom not far from here, a king summoned two of his advisors for a test. He showed them both a shiny metal box with two slots in the top, a control knob, and a lever. \"What do you think this is?\"\n\nOne advisor, an engineer, answered first. \"It is a toaster,\" he said.  The king asked, \"How would you design an embedded computer for it?\" The engineer replied, \"Using a four-bit microcontroller, I would write a simple program that reads the darkness knob and quantizes its position to one of 16 shades of darkness, from snow white to coal black. The program would use that darkness level as the index to a 16-element table of initial timer values. Then it would turn on the heating elements and start the timer with the initial value selected from the table. At the end of the time delay, it would turn off the heat and pop up the toast. Come back next week, and I'll show you a working prototype.\"\n\nThe second advisor, a computer scientist, immediately recognized the danger of such short-sighted thinking. He said, \"Toasters don't just turn bread into toast, they are also used to warm frozen waffles. What you see before you is really a breakfast food cooker. As the subjects of your kingdom become more sophisticated, they will demand more capabilities. They will need a breakfast food cooker that can also cook sausage, fry bacon, and make scrambled eggs. A toaster that only makes toast will soon be obsolete. If we don't look to the future, we will have to completely redesign the toaster in just a few years.\"\n\n\"With this in mind, we can formulate a more intelligent solution to the problem. First, create a class of breakfast foods. Specialize this class into subclasses: grains, pork, and poultry. The specialization process should be repeated with grains divided into toast, muffins, pancakes, and waffles; pork divided into sausage, links, and bacon; and poultry divided into scrambled eggs, hard- boiled eggs, poached eggs, fried eggs, and various omelet classes.\"\n\n\"The ham and cheese omelet class is worth special attention because it must inherit characteristics from the pork, dairy, and poultry classes. Thus, we see that the problem cannot be properly solved without multiple inheritance. At run time, the program must create the proper object and send a message to the object that says, 'Cook yourself.' The semantics of this message depend, of course, on the kind of object, so they have a different meaning to a piece of toast than to scrambled eggs.\"\n\n\"Reviewing the process so far, we see that the analysis phase has\nrevealed that the primary requirement is to cook any kind of  breakfast food. In the design phase, we have discovered some derived requirements. Specifically, we need an object-oriented language with multiple inheritance. Of course, users don't want the eggs to get cold while the bacon is frying, so concurrent processing is required, too.\" \n\n\"We must not forget the user interface. The lever that lowers the food lacks versatility, and the darkness knob is confusing. Users won't buy the product unless it has a user-friendly, graphical interface. When the breakfast cooker is plugged in, users should see a cowboy boot on the screen. Users click on it, and the message 'Booting UNIX v.8.3' appears on the screen. (UNIX 8.3 should be out by the time the product gets to the market.) Users can pull down a menu and click on the foods they want to cook.\"\n\n\"Having made the wise decision of specifying the software first in the design phase, all that remains is to pick an adequate hardware\nplatform for the implementation phase. An Intel 80386 with 8MB of memory, a 30MB hard disk, and a VGA monitor should be sufficient. If you select a multitasking, object oriented language that supports multiple inheritance and has a built-in GUI, writing the program will be a snap. (Imagine the difficulty we would have had if we had foolishly allowed a hardware-first design strategy to lock us into a four-bit microcontroller!).\"\n\nThe king wisely had the computer scientist beheaded, and they all\nlived happily ever after.",

I drove for just about 2km from home n my car engine started to overheat so I turned back to get  the other car. When i got home i found my husband romancing with our maid!!! I don't know what to do now. Please help.\" \n\nReply by male columnist:\n\n\n\"Dear Rose,\nOverheating of engine after such short distance can be caused by problems associated with the carburetor. You need to check oil and water level in your engine before you start your journey. You must also make sure your car is serviced regularly to avoid problems in future. Hope this helps.\" \n\n",

Based on the fact that the clone was not officially alive, he was sure he would get away with it. \n\n In the police station he told his story, confident that he could not be charged with anything. After much deliberation the chief inspector decided to arrest the scientist. \n The scientist was shocked and asked on what charge was his arrest based on. \n\n\n \"Well sir, I am arresting you for making an obscene clone fall.\" ",

Since he wasn\u2019t physically impaired he remained in the military and eventually became an Admiral.  However, during his career he was always sensitive about his appearance.  One day the Admiral was interviewing two Navy Master Chiefs and a Marine Gunnery Sergeant for his personal staff. The first Master Chief was a Surface Navy type and it was a great interview. At the end of the interview the Admiral asked him, \u201cDo you notice anything different about me?\u201d The Master Chief answered, \u201cWhy yes. I couldn\u2019t help but notice you are missing your starboard ear, so I don\u2019t know whether this impacts your hearing on that side.\u201d The Admiral got very angry at this lack of tact and threw him out of his office. The next candidate, an Aviation Master Chief, when asked this same question, answered, \u201cWell yes, you seem to be short one ear.\u201d The Admiral threw him out also. The third interview was with the Marine Gunnery Sergeant .  He was articulate, extremely sharp, and seemed to know more than the two Master Chiefs put together.  The Admiral wanted this guy, but went ahead with the same question. \u201cDo you notice anything different about me?\u201d To his surprise the Gunnery Sergeant said, \u201cYes. You wear contact lenses.\u201d The Admiral was impressed and thought to himself, what an incredibly tactful Marine. \u201cAnd how do you know that?\u201d the Admiral asked. The Gunny replied, \u201cWell sir, it\u2019s pretty hard to wear glasses with only one ear.\u201d",

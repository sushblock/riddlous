He had been abandoned as a small child and had to survive by eating the leftover food of picnics and parties. \n\nEvery day he would go swimming in the lake, practicing diving out of the a tree. He became really good at it and took pride in the one thing he was good at.\n\nOne day he was caught by a lady after trying to steal food from a birthday party. Fortunately the lady was really kind and, instead of taking him to the police, gave him 50$. \n\nThe boy had never seen such money before in his life and thanked the lady. He wanted to spend the money on something that he would enjoy. \n\nHe decided to spend the money on a vacation cruise. He went to try and book a room on the ship but the person told him that 50$ was not nearly enough for a proper room. He begged and said that he would stay in any room. The person said there was one room available. He took it without any hesitation.\n\nwhen he got to the ship an attendant walked him to his cabin. On the first floor, the rooms were made out of diamond. The boy thought he would be staying there with much glee. The attendant said that his room was further down. They walked past a gold room, silver room, bronze room, copper room, iron room, they past the kitchen and even the pantry. \n\neventually they got to the boiler room, the attendant said that his room was behind the boiler through a somewhat hidden door. Nonetheless, the boy was still happy.\n\nA little while later the captain came to the boy and said that the boy had to work on the ship in order to pay for the remaining fees. The boy told the captain the only thing he was good at was diving into water. The captain came up with a great idea. The boy would dive from a high ladder into the pool in order to entertain guests. \n\nLater that day, the staff began to prepare the ladder. The ladder was high but the boy said that it could go higher, so they raised it. Again the boy demanded it go higher. They kept on raising it until the boy was pleased. The ladder was so high it was almost impossible to see the top.\n\nAs guests began to crowd, the boy began to climb the ladder. Eventually he got to top.\n\nThis was his moment, he looked down at the people and they looked like ants. Then he jumped...\n\nHe flew through the air at such high speeds. The crowd was amazed. He landed in the pool but didnt stop there. He went through the diamond floor, silver floor, bronze floor, copper floor, iron floor, and the rest of the floors until he went through the ship completely. \n\nThe boy resurfaced on the side of the boat and the captain helped him on board in shock. The captain was bewildered that the boy had survived and asked the boy how he had managed to stay alive.\n\nThe boy replied saying that he had gone through many hardships in his life.",

The next morning he walked to work instead of taking the car, in case there was an accident, and spent the day at his desk doing very little but worrying. \n\nWhen he got home that evening he collapsed into a chair, his nerves in pieces, and told his wife all about the nightmare day that he\u2019d had.

Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen Sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs!\n\nStruggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your Business at this convention?\u201d\n\n\u201cLecturer,\u201d she responded. \u201cI use information that I have learned from my Personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what kind of myths are there?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she explained, \u201cone popular myth is that African-American men are The most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait. Another popular myth is That Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of Mexican Descent who are the best. I have also discovered that the lover with Absolutely the best stamina is the Southern Redneck.\u201d\n\nSuddenly the woman became a little uncomfortable and blushed.. \u201cI\u2019m Sorry,\u201d she said, \u201cI shouldn't really be discussing all of this with you. I don\u2019t even know your name.\u201d\n\n\u201cTonto,\u201d the man said, \u201cTonto Gonzales, but my friends call me Bubba\".\n\n*I am reposting something from facebook to share ha*",

What are you doing round this way?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working on the building site across the road,\u201d explains the duck.  \u201cI\u2019m a plasterer.\u201d\n\nThe flabbergasted barman cannot believe the duck and wants to learn more, but takes the hint when the duck pulls out a newspaper from his bag and proceeds to read it.\n\nSo, the duck reads his paper, drinks his beer, eats his sandwich, bids the barman good day and leaves.\n\nThe same thing happens for two weeks.\n\nThen one day the circus comes to town.\n\nThe ringmaster comes into the pub for a pint and the barman says to him \u201cyou\u2019re with the circus, aren\u2019t you? Well, I know this duck that could be just brilliant in your circus. He talks, drinks beer, eats sandwiches, reads the newspaper and everything!\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds marvelous,\u201d says the ringmaster, handing over his business card. \u201cGet him to give me a call.\u201d\n\nSo the next day when the Duck comes into the pub the barman says, \u201chey Mr. Duck, I reckon I can line you up with a top job, paying really good money.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always looking for the next job,\u201d says the duck.  \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the circus,\u201d says the barman.\n\n\u201cThe circus?\u201d repeats the duck.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d replies the barman.\n\n\u201cThe circus?\u201d the duck asks again. \u201cWith the big TENT?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the barman replies.\n\n\u201cWith all the animals who live in CAGES, and performers who live in CARAVANS?\u201d says the duck.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the barman replies.\n\n\u201cAnd the tent has CANVAS sides and a big canvas roof with a hole in the middle?\u201d persists the duck.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d says the barman.\n\nThe duck shakes his head in amazement, and says ..\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck would they want with a plasterer??",

The man said, 'You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife.' The agent said, 'Then you're not the right man for this job. Take your wife and go home.'\nThe second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. The man came out with tears in his eyes, 'I tried, but I can't kill my wife.' The agent said, 'You don't have what it takes. Take your wife home.'\nFinally, the last man was given the same instructions, to kill his wife. He took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the man, wiping the sweat from his brow. 'Some idiot loaded the gun with blanks' he said. 'I had to strangle the bitch to death'.",

His sister went up to him. \"I can't do this Ving, I really want to, but father will do horrible things to me, I know it. It's blasphemous.\" His sister hugs him and requests a cancellation from the court. \"I'm sorry ma'am, but cancellation requires a separate fee in and of itself.\" Just as she reaches into her purse, their dad bursts into the courtroom, with tears in his eyes. \"Son, do you really want this?\", he asks loudly with tears in his eyes. \"Yes dad, but I know it'll be blasphemous to you.\" His dad hugs him and Ling. \"Son, then I've only got one thing to say to you;\n\n\"Don't stop, be Lee, Ving.  \n Hold on to that fee, Ling.\"\n",

The card said nothing but \"Nescafe.\" Mum was puzzled at first, but then went the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: \"Good till the last drop.\" Mum blushed, but was pleased for her daughter.\n\nThe second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, and the card read: \"Benson & Hedges.\" Mum now knew to go straight to her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack: \"Extra Long. \nKing Size.\" She was again slightly embarrassed but still happy for her daughter.\n\nThe third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean. Mum waited for a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing. Then after a whole month, a card finally arrived. Written on it with shaky handwriting were the words \"British Airways.\" Mum took out her latest Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, and finally found the ad for British Airways. The ad \nsaid: \"Three times a day, seven days a week, both ways.\"\nMum fainted !",

        "body": "First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving, which is unlikely. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added. \n\nThis gives two possibilities:1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over. So which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by Anabella during my Freshman year that, 'It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,' and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is\nnot accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct..... \n\n....leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a Divine Being which explains why, last night, Anabella kept shouting 'Oh my God.'",

How could I know that when we get in the alley you won't hold me up against the wall, pull up my skirt, and have your way with me?\" \n\nJimmy replies: \"Oh my god, miss! Remember I'm carrying a bucket, a big can of red paint, a dozen of eggs, two chickens and a goose. How in the world could I possibly hold you up against the wall and do that?\"\n\nThe girl immediately replies  \"Put those eggs aside, turn the bucket upside down, put the goose inside it, put the big can of paint on top of the bucket so it won't get away, and I'll hold the chickens!\"\n\n",

Now, I had spent time around her parents once or twice before, but this would be the first time that I'd ever encountered any of her siblings, and this was apparently a big deal in her family.\n\nIt was mid-afternoon when I pulled up to the house, and I spotted my fianc\u00e9 coming out the front door.\n\n\"Oh, I'm so glad you're here!\" she told me. \"I need to run to the store for some dinner supplies, though. Go make yourself comfortable, and I'll be back in about an hour.\"\n\nWell, I went inside and walked to the living room... and there, sitting on the couch, was my fianc\u00e9's absolutely gorgeous eighteen-year-old sister. Her pert, youthful breasts were clearly visible through the material of her tank top... and below the waist, she was wearing nothing but a pair of pink panties.\n\n\"I knew you'd be coming,\" she said, \"and I know this is probably a bad idea... but I've heard so much about you from my sister, including how amazing you are in bed. I've been saving my virginity for the right man, and since you're not married yet, I want it to be you. I'll be upstairs in my bedroom, completely naked. It's the first door on the left.\"\n\nWith that, she stood up and slowly walked away. I watched the way that her hips swayed, the subtle bounce of each buttock as she moved... and I confess, I stood there thinking for a brief moment. Then, after taking a deep breath, I quickly left the house.\n\nAs soon as I walked outside, I was greeted by a huge explosion of applause. Dozens of men and women were surrounding the door, each of them with smiles on their faces. My fianc\u00e9 came rushing up to me from within the crowd and threw her arms around me.\n\n\"I knew you'd be loyal!\" she laughed. \"I'm sorry to put you through that, but I knew you'd stay true to me... and now my entire family knows, too!\"\n\nAunts, uncles, cousins, and other relatives all came up to me, offering their congratulations and welcoming me to the family. If I'm honest, I felt a little bit hurt by the whole affair, and thoroughly out of my element. Still, I learned something that day, too, and it's a moral that I've carried with me ever since:\n\nAlways keep your condoms in your car.",

The man is flabbergasted, but he finishes his pee in silence, zips up, and goes to wash his hands. The dwarf finishes around the same time and goes to wash his hands as well.   \n   \nAfter a few seconds the man can't stop himself and breaks the silence.      \n   \n \"Sir, I'm sorry, but I couldn't help noticing you've got such a large penis. How could a man with your small stature have such a big dick!?\"  \n  \n The dwarf smiles, \"You noticed that, eh? Well it's simple lad, I'm a leprechaun, I just wished it upon myself. I could do the same for you, if you'd like, but it'll cost you.\"  \n  \nThe man thinks shortly about how much his life could change if he had a bigger penis, and liking the image he painted in his head he asks \"well how much?\"  \n     \n\"Oh, I don't want money. If you want a dick like this you'll have to get on all fours and let me have my way with you.\"  \n  \nThe man is taken aback, but he starts to weigh the options in his head. 'I really don't want to get violated by a leprechaun, but I DO want a bigger dick...' He agrees to the terms and assumes the position.    \n \nThe leprechaun mounts him from behind and starts pumping steadily. \"By the way lad, how old are ya?\"    \n \n\"32, why?\"   \n  \n\"32 years old and you still believe in leprechauns!?\"",

One day he got off in a small town and on his way to the nearest bar he spotted a small dog in an alleyway.  He thought, \"Ah, perfect!\", scooped the dog up and proceeded to the bar.  Once inside he sat on a stool and put the dog down on the stool next to him.  When the bartender turned to him the drunk ordered a beer and before the bartender could protest the presence of the dog he threw his voice and made the dog say, \"I'll have one too!\"  Perplexed, the bartender poured two beers and set them in front of the drunk and the dog.  The drunk drank his beer and when the bartender turned away, he quickly downed the dog's beer too.  When the bartender came back to them the drunk ordered another beer and threw his voice again, so the dog ordered one as well.  This time, the bartender unable to contain his curiosity and bewilderment, rubbed his head and asked, \"Am I out of it, or is that dog talking?\"  The drunk ventriloquist smiled and said, \"Yeah, he's been talkin' ever since he was a pup!\"  The bartender's eyes widened and he calmly asked the drunk, \"Would you ever consider selling that dog?\"  The drunk frowned and looked at the dog.  After a couple of seconds he replied, \"Well, he means a lot to me and normally I would never consider it, but as you can see, I'm down on my luck and it may be the best for the dog, but I have to say that I couldn't take less than a thousand dollars.\"  The bartender looked in the register and answered, \"All I have is $500 now, could I owe you the rest?\"  The drunk frowned again, but replied, \"I guess I don't have much of a choice.  Ok, it's a deal!\"  The drunk finished his beer and left the bar $500 richer.\n\nA month or so later, the drunk happens upon the same town and wanders into the same bar in a drunken stupor.  He had forgotten all about the previous encounter, but the same bartender was there and recognized him instantly!  The bartender walked swiftly over to the drunk and in an angry voice said, \"You son of a bitch!  You sold me that dog and he hasn't said a word since!!\"  The drunk ventriloquist all of the sudden remembered the situation and was quick to reply, \"Really?!  That's strange.  Where is he?  Do you still have him?\"  The bartender sighed deeply and said, \"Yeah, I've got him tied up out back...\"  The drunk insisted on seeing the dog.  Once out back, the drunk leaned down and rubbed the dog on the head and scratched behind his ears and said, \"Hey!  I told you that you had to talk for this guy just like you talked for me.  What's wrong?!?\"  He threw his voice again and the dog replied, \"I ain't sayin' nothin' till he gives you that other $500!!\"",

They proceed to their table and the waiter comes to take their order. Before he leaves for the kitchen he places a basket of dinner rolls on the table.

She was reluctant to call upon little Johnnie, knowing that he sometimes could be a bit crude. But eventually his turn came. Little Johnnie walked up to the front of the class, and with a piece of chalk, made a small white dot on the blackboard, then sat back down. Well the teacher couldn't figure out what Johnnie had in mind for his report, so she asked him just what that was. \"It's a period,\" reported Johnnie. \"Well I can see that,\" she said, \"but what is so exciting about a period.\" \"Damned if I know,\" said Johnnie, \"but this morning my sister said she missed one. Then Daddy had a heart attack, Mommy fainted and the man next door shot himself.\"",

        "body": "Mouth odor is a common problem that mostly affects people who are not observing regular oral hygiene. The most obvious reason for an odor of the mouth is that particles of the food we consume remain in the gaps between the teeth. This rot over a period of time results in mouth odour or halitosis.\n\nHow To Prevent Mouth Odour\n\nThe easiest way to ensure that you do not have mouth odor is to clean and floss your teeth regularly. Do not forget to clean your tongue. \n\n\nRinsing your mouth with warm water and salt is another remedy. \n\n\nChewing on cloves will ensure that your mouth smells fresh.\n\n\nIf the smell refuses to go away despite these remedies then you need to see a doctor. Sometimes a bad smell in the mouth is connected to some kind of problem in the stomach. People who are suffering from constipation regularly that smells of their mouth and should consult their doctor at the earliest.\n\nDrop in a handful of fenugreek seeds in a pot of cold water and boil. Then strain and drink the liquid with the essence of fenugreek in.\n\nDo not eat food products containing white flour and sugar. Healthy meals would prefer your food. Instead, eat healthy meals. These should include fresh fruits and raw vegetables. You can drink a variety of juices, but avoid drinking coffee or carbonated beverages.\n\nSOURCE:http://www.naijahomeremedies.com/2015/10/Mouth-odor-remedies.html",

Even with all my magical power I cannot make that wish come true.\"  A tear drops out of the mans eye.  He really wanted to make a difference.  \"Cheer up!\" genie says, \"You still have a wish! what else might you wish for?\"   \"Well... You know Mariah Careys vagina?

So I tried to translate it and did some improvments since my first comment, too:*\n\nA 3rd grade class goes to the swimming pool.\n\nThe lifeguard asks to the class: \"Does any one of you already know how to swim?\"\n\nThen the little Dimitri, all excited, answered: \"Yes! I do!\"\n\nThe thing is, the little Dimitri has no arms.\n\nSo the lifeguard doesn't really trust him but the little Dimitri insists: \"Yeah yeah I can assure you!\"\n\nThe lifeguard finally tells him to give it a try.\n\nUnexpectedly, the little Dimitri swims very well. To the point that the lifeguard asks him: \"Where did you learn to swim like that?!\"\n\nLittle Dimitri: \"Oh I have experience. Each week-end my father brings me to the coast, throw me into the water and I have to get back to the shore really quick.\"\n\nLifeguard: \"Well... It's a little bit harsh for a method, don't you think?\"\n\nLittle Dimitri: \"Oh no it's not that big of a deal. The most difficult part is to get out of the plastic bag\".\n\n\n---\n\n\n*Because some of you were asking for it.

More than anything they needed red ink for the illustrious X's that will mark the location of the unbound riches of their future. A well known calligrapher lived in the area and Clumsy Edward knew just how to get their much-needed red ink!   \n   \"Put ye hands out and I can vault into the window he keeps open, Cap'n. In an out real quick-like, sir! Ink an everything!\"   \n   Clumsy Edward's plan was foolproof. The night had come and Captain Normal Beard and Clumsy Edward were outside the calligrapher's home. All according to plan, the window the duo had planned to use was open and the home was dark. Normal Beard interlocked his fingers as if he'd done it hundreds of times before and Edward was in the window in no time.  \n   Here's where the issue arises.   \n   Clumsy Edward, claiming his name once again, had only put enough forethought into the operation to get into the window. He was unaware of the layout of the small one-room home the calligrapher lived in. He was incredibly unaware that the calligrapher did all of his work right under the window and that he had neglected to put away his work from earlier the night. Clumsy Edward falls through the window and lands onto the table with a loud crash, alerting the neighboring citizens. \"Argh, I done crash't into the table an spill't the ink, Cap'n! I'm cover't innit!\"\nUpon hearing the commotion a nearby group of men ran to the scene to find Clumsy Edward leaving the home covered in ink. Black ink on his face. Blue across his entire torso. Red ink covering his arms and hands. \nUnfortunately, Clumsy Edward and Captain Normal Beard's dream to be wealthy pirates was known to the community and no one believed that Clumsy Edward would do something of his own fruition.   \nAfter the fallout of their plan, Captain Normal Beard went to the local tavern to attempt to drown his sorrows unaware of the fate that befell his matey.   \n   Mid-drink Clumsy Edward was thrown into the tavern followed by his captors. Upon making eye contact with his Captain, Edward immediately and profusely apologized. Seeing this, Edward's captors seized Captain Normal Beard and showed him the evidence against him. The black ink on Edward's face. The Blue in across his torso. And finally, the red ink covering his arms and hands. \"We believe Edward here to have broken into the calligrapher's home with your instruction, Normal Beard. What do ye say to these accusations?\"  \n   Captain Normal Beard was completely stunned, unable to come up with a good reason for their predicament. \nNormal Beard knew that he and his matey had been caught and they would surely hang for destruction and theft. His dream of becoming a pirate was over before it started to come to fruition. Being a man of his word, never lying, yet still sour over the outcome of the night said but one thing to the men..  \n   \"Aye, we did the deed.. An I woulda got away wit it too, had ye not caught me Red Hand Ed!\"  \n\n\n\n\n   **EDIT:**   \nFirst post, long time redditor. I was unaware as to how long this would be. I just thought of the punchline and came up with a story on the fly. I hope at least one person gets a chuckle out of it, although I doubt it warrants a laugh or a bellow with how lengthy it is and how weak the punch is. Nevertheless, hope someone enjoys it and ANY criticism is more than welcomed. I have aspirations to possibly become a stand up comic, but of course not with jokes like this seeing as how it is far from suited for that kind of venue. Any way to shorten this joke is also extremely welcome. More so than any criticism, whether it be constructive or not.   \n\n\n   *Post Edit TL;DR*  \nA pirate captain, Normal Beard, and his matey, Clumsy Edward, attempt to steal ink to make treasure maps. They break into a calligrapher's home with the matey clumsily falling and getting covered in ink, in particular, red ink on his arms and hands. The matey is caught and brought to the pirate captain by his captors who then interrogate the captain of his suspected crimes, bringing up the ink on his cohorts arms and hands. Being a man who doesn't lie, yet is still flustered the captain proclaims, \"\"Aye, we did the deed..

But he quickly pulls himself together, cleans some dried spit off the rim with his sleeve, puts his lips to the rim and tilts his head back. At this point the smell hits the whole saloon, just straight purification, clearing most of the clientele out, covering their mouths and seeking fresh air. Joe begins gulping down the contents, heaving and convulsing after every swallow, letting excess run down his chin and chest. Down his front is just this rotten, pussy, brown and black swirled slime, with chunks of chew and butts falling and splatting on the floor. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter a minute of this his friend eyes watering and mouth dropped open comes to with a fresh whiff of rancid eggs. He heaves and cries \"Kevin, stop, that's enough, you win! I cant stand it anymore, you have to stop.\" At this point, Kevin tips his head back farther and starts drinking more, letting more pussy sludge run around the edge of the spittoon. His friend seeing this looses it and runs outside to vomit. Five minutes later Kevin comes outside, green in face, empty spittoon in hand, and completely soiled with rotten mucus and spittle. Everyone in town is crowded around the entrance to the saloon curious about what was happening, covering their mouths trying to protect themselves from the disease the man is radiating. His friend slowly stands up, cleaning the vomit from his mouth and asks, \"Why didn't you stop? I said you won.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nKevin looks his friend square in the eyes and flatly responds, \"It was all one piece.\"",

They were only two ducks on the farm that weren't normal.

The first son was walking down the street when he passed a man working in the yard. The man asked him if the duck was for sale, for the man loved the taste of ducks. He offered the son 10 dollars for his duck. The son decided this was very good, so he took it. He decided his brother wouldn't be able to get close to his success. \n\nThe second son was walking and passed a whorehouse. He went in and said that he didn't have any money, but he would give them the duck. One girl said fine. After they f**ked, she decided that she didn't want the duck anymore. The son said he would take the duck back if they f**ked again. She agreed. After they f**ked the second time, the son left. \n\nHe was walking home, thinking about what to do with the duck when it broke the leash. The duck ran out into the street and was hit by a car. The lady that hit it jumped from her car and started apologizing profusely. The son insisted it was ok, but the lady said she would pay for the duck. She was in a hurry, so she gave him 25 dollars and sped off. \n\nWhen the sons got home, the farmer asked the first son what he got. He proudly displayed the 10 dollars. The farmer was impressed. He asked the second son the same thing. \n\n\"That's nothing. I got a f**k for a duck, a duck for a f**k, and 25 dollars for a f**ked up duck.\"\n",

Then they would never have to worry about the milk supply again.\n\nThey bought a bull and put it in the pasture with their beloved cow.  However, whenever the bull came close to the cow, the cow would move away. No matter what approach the bull tried, the cow would move away from the bull and he could not succeed in his quest.\nThe people were very upset and decided to ask the rabbi, who was very wise, what to do. They told the rabbi what was happening:\n\n\"Whenever the bull approaches our cow, she moves away. If he approaches from the back, she moves forward. When he approaches her from the front, she backs off. An approach from the side and she just walks away to the other side.\"\n\nThe rabbi thought about this for a minute and asked:\n\n\"Did you buy this cow from Minsk?\"\n\nThe people were dumbfounded.

One day he finally got fed up with his repetitive, insignificant life and decided that he would leave his hive, his family, his entire close-knit wasp community and he would go out into the world and make something of himself, just like the humans do. So the wasp enrolls in school, and passes with flying colors. Remember, this is a very smart wasp. He gets his high school diploma in a little under 3 years, with a 4.0 GPA and all that snazz. After high school, believe it or not, the wasp gets accepted to Harvard. Harvard! This too proves to be no challenge for our hero, as he graduates in just two years, again a 4.0, on the Dean's list, and all that snazz. Not to mention all the clubs and sports he was in-the newspaper, rowing, student government-and the fact that he was by far the most popular student on campus. Even his professors looked up to him. \nHe goes on to get two PhDs, and when he finishes his education, the wasp faces a bit of a dilemma. How does he apply his knowledge now? Where does he go from here? He decides to try out politics. After all, he was popular throughout school, did well in Harvard government. So he runs for mayor, and wins in a landslide. He greatly reforms the city, fixing virtually all its major problems. He runs for governor and again wins in a landslide. Two years later, the presidential election was coming up, and the wasp decides he might as well go for it. \nOf course, he wins in the largest landslide in US presidential history. His presidency goes exceedingly well-he is loved by all parties, and has the highest approval ratings in history. He also finds the cures for cancer, AIDS, and broken hearts while in the White House. After 8 years (yes, of course he was reelected) the time has come for him to leave his office. Even his successor his saddened by the wasp\u2019s departure, but they all know it\u2019s what must be done. Back at his vacation home in California his first day after leaving office, the wasp looks back on his long and fruitful life. He realizes that he hasn't been back to his hive at all since that first day he left. He suddenly feels a twang of guilt as he realizes how much he misses his parents and his little brother. So he heads back to the hive, looking more worn out than he remembers. He goes inside and greets his family, who are overjoyed at the sight of him. He talks about how his life has gone as his family listens in wonderment. Eventually he decides he is thirsty, so he decides to visit the old watering hole he remembered. Once he gets there though, there\u2019s an extremely long line. He decides it\u2019s worth the wait, so gets in line. One hour. Two hours. This is the slowest moving line he\u2019s ever seen! Eventually he calculates that it could be a few days before he gets to the front of the line, so decides it\u2019s not worth it. He decides to go get some cider to drink instead, but waddya know, another huge line of people waiting for cider! He remembers one other drinking area that never had a long line-fruit punch! So he decides to go get punch. He arrives, and lo and behold, there's no punch line.",

Just as the waiter is coming to his table, he sees another waiter bringing the Matador Special to a customer who got there before him.  \"Damn!\" he says to himself.  \"And tomorrow's my last day here.\"\n\nSo the next day, he skips the bull fight, and arrives at the restaurant early.  He is the first one seated, and proudly proclaims, \"I'll have the Matador Special!\"\n\n\"An excellent choice, Senor!\" responds the waiter.  Soon afterwards, the waiter brings out his dish, but the meat balls are disappointingly small, and taste rather foul.\n\n\"What's with this,\" the now angry man shouts, \"I thought this was your premier dish!\"\n\n\"I'm very sorry, Senor,\" said the waiter, \"But you see, sometimes zee bull, he wins.\" ",

He's like 100 feet tall and stomping around like Godzilla, just absolutely crushing shit and laughing about it. The Pope hears about this and decides he has to go and try to stop Satan. Obviously, he takes the dog along.\n\nSo the Pope gets to Satan and is all, \"Hey-a you Satan! You-a betta stop a-stompin' around! In-a the name-a Jesus! You go-a right back-a to Hell!\"\n\nSatan just laughs. He lifts up his giant devil-foot and smushes the Pope. The dog tries to jump in the way to protect him, but obviously he gets smushed too, poor pooch.\n\nAnyway, as everyone knows, the rule is that if Satan kills the Pope, then a magic portal to Heaven opens up and Satan is supposed to be able to climb through it and run a-muck in Heaven. So, Satan's all stoked cause now he gets to go do that, but right as he's about to climb through the portal, God shows up and is like, \"Ah-ah-ah nooo I don't think so Satan!\"\n\nThen Satan's like, \"WTF God?! Rule says I get to come in there and tear shit up!\"\n\nBut then God's like, \"Oh Hellllll no! Ain't no way you settin' foot in here with that dog-pope on your feet!\"\n",

He is led to the guest bathroom that contains the leaky pipe under the sink. Troy assesses the problem and tells Obama that it's an easy repair, that will take less than 10 minutes. Obama asks Troy how much it will cost. Troy checks his rate chart and says, \"$9,500.\" \n\"What?! $9,500?!\" Obama asks, stunned, \"But you said it's an easy repair. Michelle will whip me if I pay a plumber that much!\" \nTroy says, \"Yes, but what I do is charge those who make more than $250,000 per year a much higher amount so I can fix the plumbing of poorer people for free. This has always been my philosophy. As a matter of fact, I lobbied the Democrat Congress, who passed this philosophy into law. Now all plumbers must do business this way. It's known as the 'Affordable Plumbing Act of 2014'. I'm surprised you haven't heard of it.\" \nIn spite of that, Obama tells Troy there's no way he's paying that much for a small plumbing repair, so Troy leaves. Obama spends the next hour flipping through the phone book calling for another plumber, but he finds that all other plumbing businesses in the area have gone out of business. Not wanting to pay Troy's price, Obama does nothing and the leak goes un-repaired for several more days. A week later the leak is so bad President Obama has had to put a bucket under the sink. \nMichelle is not happy as she has Oprah and guests arriving the next morning. The bucket fills up quickly and has to be emptied every hour, and there's a risk the room will flood, so Obama calls Troy and pleads with him to return. \nTroy goes back to Obama's house, looks at the leaky pipe, checks his new rate chart and says, \"Let's see, this will now cost you $21,000.\" \nObama quickly fires back, \"What? A few days ago you told me it would cost $9,500!\" \nTroy explains, \"Well, because of the 'Affordable Plumbing Act,' a lot of wealthier people are learning how to maintain and take care of their own plumbing, so there are fewer payers in the plumbing exchanges. As a result, the price I have to charge wealthy people like you keeps rising. Not only that, but for some reason the demand for plumbing work by those who get it for free has skyrocketed! There's a long waiting list of those who need repairs, but the amount we get doesn't cover our costs, especially paperwork and record-keeping. This unfortunately has put a lot of my fellow plumbers out of business, they're not being replaced, and nobody is going into the plumbing business because they know they can't make any money at it. I'm hurting too, all thanks to greedy rich people like you who won't pay their 'fair share'. On the other hand, why didn't you buy plumbing insurance last December? If you had bought plumbing insurance available under the 'Affordable Plumbing Act,' all this would have been covered by your policy.\" \n\"You mean I wouldn't have to pay anything to have you fix my plumbing problem?\" asks Obama. \n\"Well, not exactly,\" replies Troy. \"You would have had to buy the insurance before the deadline, which has passed now. And, because you're rich, you would have had to pay $34,000 in premiums, which would have given you a 'silver' plan, and then, since this would have been your first repair, you would have to pay up to the $21,000 deductible, and anything over that would have a $7,500 co-pay, and then there's the mandatory maintenance program, which is covered up to 17.5%, so there are some costs involved. Nothing is for free.\" \n\"WHAT?!\" exclaims Obama. \"Why so much for a puny sink leak?!\" \nWith a bland look, Troy replies, \"Well, paperwork, mostly, like I said. And the internal cost of the program itself. You don't think a program of this complexity and scope can run itself, do you? Besides, there are millions of folks with lower incomes than you, even many in the 'middle class', who qualify for subsidies that people like you must support. That's why they call it the 'Affordable Plumbing Act'! Only people who don't make much money can afford it. If you want affordable plumbing, you'll have to give away most of what you have accumulated and cut your and Michelle's income by about 90%. Then you can qualify to GET your 'Fair Share' instead of GIVING it.\" \n\"But who would pass a crazy act like the 'Affordable Plumbing Act'?!\" exclaims the exasperated Obama. \nAfter a sigh, Troy replies, \"Congress ... because they didn't read it.\" \nThis will help you understand Obamacare .... And here you have it, the 'Affordable Plumbing Act of 2014'.",

It seemed that each passing day, night absorbed more of the light, and the days grew progressively colder. Fearful that the Nightman was punishing them, they congregated in the town square to seek the wisdom of the elders.\n\n\u201cHey guys, didja notice that it seems each passing day, night absorbs more of the light, and the days grow progressively colder?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah! We really should do something about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fearful that the Nightman is punishing us, we should congregate in the town square to seek the wisdom of the elders!\u201d\n\nSoon, all the townspeople joined those other three guys in the square. The crowd was overcome with panic as the Eldest Elder approached the proscenium. (The square had a really awesome stage.)\n\nHe exclaimed, \u201cDo not fear The Dying of the Light, my people, for I am Dayman, Fighter of the Nightman, Champion of the Sun. I have found a solution! We will set our clocks back one hour and your fears will be allayed.\u201d\n\nThe crowd hushed as confusion set in.\n\n\u201cWhat the Hell is a clock?\u201d cried Townsperson #3.  \u201cAnd what the Hell is an hour?\u201d shouted Townsperson #1 (smugly, considering his status as Townsperson #1). \n\nThe Eldest Elder continued, \u201cSo where it was once 7 o\u2019clock, it will now be 8 o\u2019clock. Thus giving us an additional hour of daylight- so we can continue to wash our underwear in the same river from which we bath and drink.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the Hell in an o\u2019clock?\u201d muttered a muddled, unnumbered, townsperson. (Numbering of townspeople was completely arbitrary in those days.)\n\nAt this point, Elders Arizona and Indiana looked at each other; knowing the Eldest Elder was incorrect, they shook their heads and retreated behind the curtain- never to be seen again. (Legend has it these elders left for a place the Nightman did not follow.)\n\nThe rumblings dissipated as the townspeople grappled with understanding the implications of this new system. Although something seemed amiss, they did not question the authority and superior judgment of the Eldest Elder. After all, he was Dayman, Fighter of the Nightman, Champion of the Sun. And he had tenure so there was nothing they could do about it anyhow.\n\nSurprisingly, in the days to come, despite the Eldest Elder\u2019s bold proclamation, it was found that the Dying of the Light increased dramatically. Fearing the wrath of the Nightman, the townspeople did not speak up, for his power was undeniable and they would not encourage his wrath any further. Instead, before night fell over the town, they worked with great urgency to wash their underwear in the same river from which they bathed and drank.\n\nAnd thus the tradition of Daylight Savings Time was begun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026Some time later, a young boy sat on the Eldest Elder\u2019s lap and asked, \u201cWhere do girls come from?\u201d The elder looked upon the boy, gulped back the dregs of his sixth brew, burped into his beard, and then muttered something about tearing out a man's rib.

I'm not hiring any Cajuns, the foreman thought to himself, so he made up a test hoping that the Cajun wouldn't be able to answer the questions, and he'd be able to refuse him the job without getting into an argument.\n\n\n\"Here's your first question,\" the foreman said. \"Without using numbers, represent the number 9.\" \"Without numbers?\" The Cajun says. \"Dat is easy,\" and proceeds to draw\nthree trees.\n\n\n\"What's this?\" the boss asks. \"Ave you got no brain? Tree and tree and tree make nine.\" says the Cajun.\n\n\n\"Fair enough,\" says the boss.\n\"Here is your second question. Use the same rules, but this time the number is \n\n99.\"\nThe Cajun stares into space for a while, then picks up the picture that he has just drawn and makes a smudge on each tree. \"Ere you go.\"\n\n\nThe boss scratches his head and says, \"How on earth do you get that to represent 99?\"\n\"Each of DA trees is dirty now! So it's dirty tree, and dirty tree, and dirty tree. Dat is 99.\"\n\n\nThe boss is getting worried he's going to have to hire this Coonass, so he says, \"All right, last question. Same rules again, but represent the number 100.\"\n\n\nThe Cajun stares into space again, then he picks up the picture again and makes a little mark at the base of each tree, and says, \"Ere you go. One 'hundred.\"\n\n\nThe boss looks at the attempt. \"You must be nuts if you think that represents a hundred.\"\n\n\nThe Cajun leans forward and points to the marks at the tree bases, and says, \"A little dog come along and crap by each tree, so now you've got dirty tree and a turd, dirty tree and a turd, and dirty tree and a turd, which make one 'hundred. So when I start?\"\n",

And all of you sons of bitches who are getting on, get your asses in the train, cause we're going down the tracks.\" The mother went nuts and told her son, \"We don't use that kind of language in this house. Now I want you to go to your room and you are to stay there for TWO HOURS. When you come out, you may play with your train, but I want you to use nice language.\" Two hours later, the son comes out of the bedroom and resumes playing with his train. Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say, \"All passengers who are disembarking from the train, please remember to take all of your belongings with you. We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon.\" She hears the little boy continue, \"For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat. Remember, there is no smoking on the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us today.\" As the mother began to smile, the child added, \"For those of you who are pissed off about the two hour delay, please see the bitch in the kitchen.\"",

I will grant you three wishes, but I caution you!  Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it!\"\n\nI brushed off the warning and right away I wished to be the richest man on Earth.  The genie waved his hands and suddenly a massive beachfront mansion appears, piles of gold and money sprout from the sand around me, and the genie hands me the keys to a Ferrari.  \n\nSo that one went pretty well, for my next wish I wished for the most beautiful wife in the world.  The genie clapped his hands and out of the ocean strides the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, so beautiful I almost regretted wishing for her.  I didn't deserve to look at that woman.  I still don't.\n\nThen the genie said, \"You have one final wish!\"\n\nAnd this is probably where I made my mistake.  I wished for a big orange head.",

One little boy stands up and offers: \"If my best friend who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a runaway tractor comes along and knocks him dead, that would be a tragedy.\"\n\"No,\" says Mr Trump, \"that would be an accident.\"\nA little girl raises her hand: \"If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.\"\n\"I'm afraid not,\" explains the exalted businessman. \"That's what we would call a great loss.\"\nThe room goes silent. No other children volunteer. Mr Trump searches the room. \"Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?\"\nFinally at the back of the room, little Johnny raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says: \"If a private jet carrying you was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.\"\n\"Fantastic!\" exclaims Mr Trump, \"That's right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?\"\n\"Well,\" says the boy, \"because it sure as hell wouldn't be a great loss and it probably wouldn't be an accident either.\"\n",

The old alligator helps him out, and after the lizard is breathing again, the old alligator says \"What do you think your doing trying to swim in these waters, and what have you been smoking?!\"\n\nAfter the lizard explains to the old alligator, he has to find out exactly what is going on. He walks down river to meet this bad monkey who knows he's doing something wrong.\n\nWhile walking down the path, he finds the monkey still in the tree smoking marihuana.

The next day he goes to the local sex toy shop and not impressed with the initial selection he asks the gentleman behind the counter for the best dildo money can buy.\n\nThe clerk goes to the back and appears with a seemingly ancient dusty wooden box. As he opens the box it reveals an intricately carved dildo. Amazed the husband asks \"What is that?!\". The clerk simply responds that it is named Voodoo Dick. \n\nThe clerk proceeds to tell the man how it works. using some sort of black magic you can command the Voodoo Dick by simply stating \"Voodoo Dick!, and then stating where you would like the Voodoo dick to start pleasuring.  He ends the conversation with the most important piece of advice. He says \"when you are finished with it you must state \"Voodoo Dick stop\" or command it to move to another part of the body. \n\nThe husband throws money at the clerk and runs home. He explains it to his wife in detail and then leaves on his trip.\n\nThe first week goes by and the wife decides that she needs a little action and opens the box containing Voodoo dick. struggling to remember the exact commands she finally utters \"Voodoo Dick, My pussy!\". A slight shimmer surrounds the magical dildo and it raises from its box and starts immediately pounding away at her vagina. \n\nShe reaches the most amazing orgasm she has ever experienced. Looking down she states \"ok you can stop now\". Voodoo dick keeps fucking. \n\n\"STOP!\" she screams. Voodoo dick keeps fucking.\n\"QUIT, its hurting now!\". Voodoo dick keeps fucking.\n\nIn a panic she runs to her car and starts driving to the nearest hospital. The whole time she is speeding down the highway, Voodoo dick is pounding away.\n\nA police officer sees her speeding and pulls her over.\nFrantically she tells the whole story to the officer in hopes he will let her go.\nThe officer, taken back by the story, looks at her and says...\n\nVoodoo Dick my ass!\n  ",

We certainly wouldn't give a ticket.\"\n\nFinally, the pair see a red sports car roar down the shoulder, zipping past one, two, three cars before Burt can flip the siren on and zoom along the shoulder after him.\n\nAs both cars come to a stop, Juan's face lights up.  \"Ah, this is more what I'm used to.  I know how to handle this one,\" he says.  He steps out of the car, draws his gun, and shoots the driver dead.\n\n\"What'd you do that for?!\" yells Burt.

Can I make you your usual? Gin and Tonic?\"\n\n\"Murray\", says Estelle, now a little more urgently, \"how does the bartender know you??\"\n\n\"Oh, that's just Renee.. she bartends at the bowling alley - i guess she moonlights here too.\"\n\n\"Ok\", says Estelle.. getting a bit more rattled.\n\nThey find a seat, and a stripper comes right up to Murray and starts grinding him.\n\"Hey Muuuuurray... you want your usual dance tonight baby?\"\n\nAt this, Estelle has had enough, and storms out the front door, with Murray chasing after her.\n\nShe hails one of the taxis parked out front, and he jumps in after her. \n\nMurray can't get a word in edgewise. After giving the driver directions, Estelle lays into him. Cursing at him. Yelling at him. Calling him every name in the book. \n\nThis goes on for about 5 solid minutes, until Estelle, exhausted from the explosion, stops altogether.\n\nThere's finally a moment of silence in the cab.\n\n\"Hey Murray,\" says the cab driver, \"this girl you got tonight is a real bitch.\"",

The doctor, never having seen anything like this before, orders some tests and tells the man to return in two days for the results.\n\nThe man returns a couple of days later and the doctor says: \u201cI\u2019ve got bad news for you. You\u2019ve contracted Mongolian VD. It\u2019s very rare and almost unheard of here.

We\u2019re going to have to amputate your penis.\u201d\n\nThe man screams in horror, \u201cAbsolutely not! I want a second opinion!\u201d\n\nThe doctor replies: \u201cWell, it\u2019s your choice. Go ahead if you want, but surgery is your only choice.\u201d\n\nThe next day, the man seeks out a Chinese doctor, figuring that he\u2019ll know more about the disease.\n\nThe Chinese doctor examines his penis and proclaims: \u201cAh, yes, Mongolian VD. Velly lare disease.\u201d\n\nThe guy says to the doctor: \u201cYeah, yeah, I already know that, but what we can do? My American doctor wants to operate and amputate my penis!\u201d\n\nThe Chinese doctor shakes his head and laughs: \u201cStupid Amelican docta, always want to opelate. Make more money, that way. No need to opelate!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Thank God!,\u201d the man replies.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d says the Chinese doctor, \u201cyou no worry! Wait two weeks... it fall off by itself!\u201d",

Then she would proceed to yell and scream at him, for his constant nights out and always coming home in a drunken state. But Merle just continued his nightly routine. One day, the wife was talking to a friend about her husband's behavior and was particularly distraught by it all. The friend listened and said, \"Why don't you treat him a little differently when he comes home? Instead of berating him, why don't you give him some loving words and welcome him home with a kiss? Then he might change his ways.\" The wife thought that this might be a good idea. That night, Merle took off again after dinner. And at about midnight, he arrived home in his usual condition. His wife heard him at the door. She quickly opened it and let Merle in. Instead of berating him as she had always done, this time she took his arm and led him into the living room. She sat Merle down in an easy chair, put his feet up on the ottoman and took his shoes off. Then she went behind him and started to cuddle him a little. After a little while, she said to Merle, \"It's pretty late, dear. I think we had better go upstairs to bed now, don't you think?\" At that, in his inebriated state he replied, \"I guess we might as well. I'll get in trouble when I get home anyway!\"\n",

        "body": "Tom was a member of the mafia, along with Dick, Harry, and John. One day, they decided to rob a bank. They ended up deciding that Tom was the main robber, Dick the getaway driver, Harry backup muscle, and John the lookout.\n\nThe day came and Dick drove them all to the bank. Tom got out first, followed by Harry then John. John entered a nearby building to watch the streets from the roof, where he had previously set up a sniper rifle, Harry went into the bank, with a gun in his pocket, and Tom went up to the till, also with a gun. Dick, of course, being the getaway driver, remained in the car.\n\nTom went up to the till and requested to withdraw \u00a3250 from his own account. Not having been threatened at all, the teller obligingly did so, but had to turn away to get a few spare \u00a350 notes.\n\nWhile the teller was doing this, Tom planted a small, powerful explosive near the corner of the glass barrier. Tom then walked away after putting the \u00a3250 in his wallet, pretending to exit the bank, when he detonated the explosive.\n\nIn the confusion caused by said explosive (the staff having secretly pressed the alarm button to silently alert the police), Harry and Tom broke down the \"Employees Only\" door and threatened the staff to show them to the vaults. The staff obviously complied, and opened the vaults for them, allowing them to abscond with \u00a3200,000 in total.\n\nThe police arrived and John was doing an excellent job keeping them at bay with the sniper rifle. Tom and Harry both ran out the bank, with Tom first entering the car while Harry joined the crossfire. John, seeing this, saw that it was time for him to get into the car, so he ran down the steps, and entered the car too. Harry then made it in and they sped off back to their base near the Thames, somehow losing the police in the process.\n\nHaving made it off the radar, they now had the problem of dividing the pickings. Tom, of course, argued that since he had planted the bomb, he should deserve the most share, since the operation could not have gone well without that critical step. John argued that had he not been there, the police would have arrested the other three, and that they should show some respect. Dick argued that he had done everyone the favour of shaking off the cops, and Harry merely said that everyone should all get equal amounts for doing the same amount of work.\n\nTom then said that Harry didn't really do anything. Harry argued that John had abandoned his post. John said that any competent driver would have stopped the cops from following them, and Dick said that anyone could have done Tom's work.\nThe argument in this manner escalated, and eventually it turned into a physical brawl. Over the course of the brawl, Tom grabbed the \u00a3200,000, but was then pushed by Harry into the Thames! Tom unfortunately never learned how to swim, and so promptly drowned.\n\nWhen the other three noticed that their earnings had been waterlogged, they all jumped into the water to retrieve it. Thankfully, they were able to recover the full \u00a3200,000, as well as the \u00a3250 in Tom's wallet.\n\nHowever, the notes were all slimy and dirty from the sewage in the Thames, and so rendered nigh-unusable.\n\nA silence was heard between the three. It was soon broken by Harry, though.\n\n\"Before we split this money up... let's make sure we launder it.\"\n\n[x-post /r/punny, didn't want to ruin the joke by placing this in the title.]",

She realizes that the is going to fart at any moment, whether she wants to or not.\n\nShe pushes away from her date and says, \"The kissing is stirring up deep emotions in me and I feel the need to express them through music. I want to play a piece I've just learned on the piano, it's called 'The Storm'.\" She sits at the piano and begins playing. The piece gets louder and more tumultuous, and at the right moment, she lets one rip, loud, but masked by the music. She plays for a bit longer then returns to the couch feeling that she'd dodged a bullet.\n\nA bit later she feels it again. The pressure. She tries to contain it, but she knows that it will soon overwhelm her. \"Oh, honey, I have to play again. The passion compels me.\" She repeats her earlier performance, and at the same part in the 'The Storm', she farts.\n\nBack again on the couch, as the passion continues, she feels the urge yet again. She says, \"Baby, I just gotta play 'The Storm' again. I'm sure you're getting tired of the piece, but I must express myself.\"\n\nShe stands and walks to the piano. Her date says, \"Go ahead, I love the piece, but could you leave the part out where the lightning strikes the shit house?\"",

Slowly I began to filet the flesh, carving away bright pink hunks of meat and setting them aside for myself.  The child was hungry, and she must have her favorite piece.  I gulped down chunks of innards as I made my way through the thing, my offspring drooling as we got closer to her goal.  Finally fhere it was - the heart - and I carefully sliced it into small pieces and flung them at my ravenous young.  She shoveled hunks of the thing into her mouth, the juices flowing down her cheeks, here and there slinging bits below.  Ravenous dogs gobbled up whatever scraps were flung aside in her haste.  I made my way through the remaining flesh, delighting in her rapturous indulgence, until finally no meat remained save a single vein dangling from her gaping maw.  As she clapped her hands eagerly, squealing \"more, more!\" I thought to myself, \"next time we're going to need a bigger watermelon\".",

He asks her out to a movie; she accepts; they have a pretty good time. A few nights later he asks her out to dinner, and again they enjoy themselves. They continue to see each other regularly, and after a while neither one of them is seeing anybody else.\n\nAnd then, one evening when they're driving home, a thought occurs to Martha, and, without really thinking, she says it aloud: \"Do you realize that, as of tonight, we've been seeing each other for exactly six months?\"\n\nAnd then, there is silence in the car.\n\nTo Martha, it seems like a very loud silence. She thinks to herself: I wonder if it bothers him that I said that. Maybe he's been feeling confined by our relationship; maybe he thinks I'm trying to push him into some kind of obligation that he doesn't want, or isn't sure of.\n\nAnd Fred is thinking: Gosh. Six months.\n\nAnd Martha is thinking: But, hey, I'm not so sure I want this kind of relationship either. Sometimes I wish I had a little more space, so I'd have time to think about whether I really want us to keep going the way we are, moving steadily towards, I mean, where are we going? Are we just going to keep seeing each other at this level of intimacy? Are we heading toward marriage? Toward children? Toward a lifetime together? Am I ready for that level of commitment? Do I really even know this person?\n\nAnd Fred is thinking: ...so that means it was...let's see...February when we started going out, which was right after I had the car at the dealer's, which means...lemme check the odometer...Whoa! I am way overdue for an oil change here.\n\nAnd Martha is thinking: He's upset. I can see it on his face. Maybe I'm reading this completely wrong. Maybe he wants more from our relationship, more intimacy, more commitment; maybe he has sensed - even before I sensed it - that I was feeling some reservations. Yes, I bet that's it. That's why he's so reluctant to say anything about his own feelings. He's afraid of being rejected.\n\nAnd Fred is thinking: And I'm gonna have them look at the transmission again. I don't care what those morons say, it's still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It's 87 degrees out, and this thing is shifting like a garbage truck, and I paid those incompetent thieves $600.\n\nAnd Martha is thinking: He's angry. And I don't blame him. I'd be angry, too. I feel so guilty, putting him through this, but I can't help the way I feel. I'm just not sure.\n\nAnd Fred is thinking: They'll probably say it's only a 90-day warranty...scumballs.\n\nAnd Martha is thinking: Maybe I'm just too idealistic, waiting for a knight to come riding up on his white horse, when I'm sitting right next to a perfectly good person, a person I enjoy being with, a person I truly do care about, a person who seems to truly care about me. A person who is in pain because of my self-centered, schoolgirl romantic fantasy.\n\nAnd Fred is thinking: Warranty? They want a warranty? I'll give them a warranty. I'll take their warranty and stick it right up their...\n\n\"Fred,\" Martha says aloud.\n\n\"What?\" says Fred, startled.\n\n\"Please don't torture yourself like this,\" she says, her eyes beginning to brim with tears. \"Maybe I should never have...oh dear, I feel so...\"(She breaks down, sobbing.)\n\n\"What?\" says Fred.\n\n\"I'm such a fool,\" Martha sobs. \"I mean, I know there's no knight. I really know that. It's silly. There's no knight, and there's no horse.\"\n\n\"There's no horse?\" says Fred.\n\n\"You think I'm a fool, don't you?\" Martha says.\n\n\"No!\" says Fred, glad to finally know the correct answer.\n\n\"It's just that...it's that I...I need some time,\" Martha says.\n\n(There is a 15-second pause while Fred, thinking as fast as he can, tries to come up with a safe response. Finally he comes up with one that he thinks might work.)\n\n\"Yes,\" he says. (Martha, deeply moved, touches his hand.)\n\n\"Oh, Fred, do you really feel that way?\" she says.\n\n\"What way?\" says Fred.\n\n\"That way about time,\" says Martha.\n\n\"Oh,\" says Fred. \"Yes.\" (Martha turns to face him and gazes deeply into his eyes, causing him to become very nervous about what she might say next, especially if it involves a horse. At last she speaks.)\n\n\"Thank you, Fred,\" she says.\n\n\"Thank you,\" says Fred.\n\nThen he takes her home, and she lies on her bed, a conflicted, tortured soul, and weeps until dawn, whereas when Fred gets back to his place, he opens a bag of Doritos, turns on the TV, and immediately becomes deeply involved in a rerun of a college basketball game between two South Dakota junior colleges that he has never heard of. A tiny voice in the far recesses of his mind tells him that something major was going on back there in the car, but he is pretty sure there is no way he would ever understand what, and so he figures it's better if he doesn't think about it.\n\nThe next day Martha will call her closest friend, or perhaps two of them, and they will talk about this situation for six straight hours. In painstaking detail, they will analyze everything she said and everything he said, going over it time and time again, exploring every word, expression, and gesture for nuances of meaning, considering every possible ramification.\n\nThey will continue to discuss this subject, off and on, for weeks, maybe months, never reaching any definite conclusions, but never getting bored with it either.\n\nMeanwhile, Fred, while playing racquetball one day with a mutual friend of his and Martha's, will pause just before serving, frown, and say: \"Norm, did Martha ever own a horse?\"\n\nAnd that's the difference between men and women.",

Not only was she the bride of Christ, she had taken a vow of celibacy, and besides, it would be a sin. \"Good Point\", admitted the hitchhiker coolly, \"But if you don't let me have sex with you, I'll rape you - and that'll be a mortal sin for me. How could you have that on your conscience.\" The nun thought hard, then asked, \"Are you Catholic?\" The hitchhiker assured her he was. \"Are you married?\" asked the nun. \"I'm as single as you are, Sister,\" he promised. \"All right\" she said, \"then I'll agree to having anal intercourse with you. That will only be a venial sin, and I can keep my virginity.\" She pulled over, they went off into the woods and had sex, and got back in the car. A few miles down the road, the hitchhiker admitted he had a confession to make. \"I enjoyed that, Sister, but I lied to you: I'm Jewish. And that's not all,\" the hitchhiker went on unhappily, \"I've got a wife and two kids.\" The nun turned very pale, and her hands trembled on the steering wheel. But after a few minutes of silence, she said, \"Well, there's something you should know about me, too. My name's Bob, and I'm on my way to a Halloween party!\"",

He could juggle them behind his back, he could juggle them blindfolded, he could even juggle them while standing on his head. His skill was unmatched and all of his shows were sold out, no matter what part of the world he performed in.\n\nBut he had a secret: his hands were very small and because of it, he could only juggle with a special kit containing custom balls made specially for his tiny hands. Every time he would try to juggle other objects, he would always fail, so he only performed with that kit.\n\nAfter several years of performing he started noticing that his shows didn't sell out anymore. Every other show there were more and more empty seats. When he asked why, he was told that people were becoming bored with his act of only juggling regular balls when there were other artists out there using more interesting props such as bowling balls, knives, swords, chainsaws, torches and even live animals.\n\nThe juggler became depressed. The less popular his shows became, the more he started drinking. All his life he knew how to do only one thing, and that was juggling. After several months of drinking, he had wasted all of his money. The only thing he had left were the clothes he was wearing and the juggling kit. He decided to leave all of his failures behind and become a monk. He sold his juggling kit and used the money to travel to the nearest monastery.\n\nTen years had passed when the once famous juggler couldn't handle the abstinence anymore. He sneaked out of the monastery and searched for a pub to have a few drinks. Even though he had grown a long beard, the bartender at the pub remembered his face and recognized him:\n\n\"Aren't you the juggler who was world famous about 10 years ago?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am.\"\n\n\"What happened to you, where did you go all those years back?\"\n\n\"I became a monk.\"\n\n\"Well, if you're a monk, why are you drinking?\"\n\n\"For ten years, I haven't touched a single bottle. For ten years, I haven't touched a single woman. I just can't take it anymore, I want to feel like a normal person again\"\n\nThe bartender understood his problem and nodded in agreement. He then pointed to a woman sitting at the other end of the pub and said:\n\n\"I'm sure she could take care of your second problem. Just show her your juggling skills and she will definitely be impressed.\"\n\nThe monk responded:\n\n\"Yes, I've been thinking about it as well...\n\n...but I don't have the balls to do it.\"",

Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage.\n\nKeeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes.The pleasure was indescribable!\n\nEventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself.\n\nMy face must have been the picture of innocence when my husband returned, apologizing for taking so long.\n\nHe asked me if I had peeked through the blindfold, and I assured him I had not.\n\nAt this point, he removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table, with their hands to their noses.",

After hearing some mediocre players, a man walks into the room, sits down at the piano, and proceeds to play the most amazing music the manager has ever heard.  When the pianist finishes, the manager begins clapping emphatically.  \"Bravo!\" he says.  \"Is that original music?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" the pianist replies.  \"I wrote it myself.\"  \"What's it called?\" asks the manager.  \"It's called, 'I Want To Bend You Over The Couch and Hump You Three Ways to Sunday.'\"  The manager is taken aback by this answer.  Shaking his head, he says, \"well, do you have any others?\"  \"Sure,\" says the pianist as he sits back down and again proceeds to play beautiful music.  When he finishes, the manager asks, \"another original?\"  \"Yes,\" says the pianist, \"it's called 'I Want To Bury My Face In Your Hairy Beaver and Squeeze Your Tits All Night Long.'\"  The manager cringes again, but is so taken with the man's music, he says \"Well, I'm going to give you the job because your music is amazing, but please do not tell any of our patrons the titles of your original pieces.\"  \"It's a deal,\" says the pianist.\nThe pianist plays a spectacular set on his first night and the audience receives him with great enthusiasm.  As the pianist gets up to take a break, he bends over to pick up a piece of music he dropped and the back of his pants rip wide open, and as it turns out, he's not wearing underwear.  As he passes by the audience on his way to the bathroom,  an old lady leans over and grabs his arm.  \"Excuse me young man, but do you know your pants are ripped wide open and your hairy scrotum is hanging out for everyone to see?\" she asks.  \"Know it?!\" says the pianist, \"I wrote it!!!\"",

Now it is a part of Romania, but there is a lot of Hungarian population living there that still dreams about being an independent country, so they consider themselves Hungarians, Romanians call them Hungarians, but they are in fact Romanians with Hungarian names. Obviously this is a source for a lot of conflicts and jokes in our country, like the one below.)\n\n**----------------------------------------**\n\nThere was this Hungarian guy and he was to be married with a Romanian girl and his father instructs the guy how to act with his young bride:\n\n- When you get in front of the door with your bride, lift her up in your arms so she can see the Hungarian is STRONG, then get in the room and throw her on the bed contemptuously so she can see the Hungarian is PROUD, then you get naked in front of her so she can see the Hungarian is HANDSOME and then you know what you have to do, right?\n\n- Right dad, says the young groom.\n\nThe next day they meet and the father asks the son about his wedding night.  And he starts describing his night:\n\n- Well, I crossed her over the doorstep in my arms to show her that I am strong. Then I threw her on the bed contemptuously to show her I am proud, then I got naked to show her I am handsome and then I masturbated in front of her.\n\n- What the fuck??? Why would you do that? the father asks\n\n- To show her that the Hungarian is INDEPENDENT and AUTONOMOUS, of course ...\n\n**----------------------------------------**\n\nAlso I am Romanian, and my new boyfriend is Hungarian, and after the first night of sex I just couldn't stop myself from saying this after the deed was done:\n\n- Not so  INDEPENDENT and AUTONOMOUS now, are you?\n\n\n(Sorry for the long joke, imagine there's a potato here)",

One of them was, quite frankly, stupid, while the other was very sharp indeed. In fact, he was a master of ready wit and stunning repartee.\n\nOne evening the stupid twin went to a circus that happened to be in town. He went early so he could get a good seat in the front row, right beside the ring, and he thoroughly enjoyed the experience. He marvelled at the elephants, cowered from the lions, and gaped at the trapeze artists in their skimpy costumes; he reacted exactly the way he was meant to.\n\nLast of all, on came the clowns. They were his favourite bit of the circus. All that falling over, all that water, all those custard pies - it was hilarious. The lead clown was the most ludicrous of the lot: he had bigger shoes, baggier trousers, brighter make-up and the most enormous red nose. And part of the lead clown's job was to make fun of people in the audience.\n\nSo the clown looked around for someone to hassle, and saw a rather stupid-looking man sitting right in the front row. Ideal. He went up to the stupid twin and said:\n\n\"Sir, are you the front end of an ass?\"\n\nThe stupid man sat there wishing that he hadn't come, wishing that the clown would go away and pick on someone else. He knew he wasn't very intelligent, and he knew he would come out of this looking very foolish. But he spoke up. \"No,\" he said.\n\n\"Sir, are you the back end of an ass?\" the clown continued.\n\n\"No, I'm not,\" the stupid man replied.\n\n\"Then, sir,\" the clown said slowly, letting the audience savour the moment, \"you are no end of an ass!\"\n\nThe audience, having a fairly poor sense of humour, erupted into laughter. The stupid man just wished he could die. Fortunately for him, the show was soon over.\n\nWhen he got home, the stupid man told his brother what had happened.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" said the master of ready wit and stunning repartee, \"I am a master of ready wit and stunning repartee. Tomorrow night I will go to the circus and make that clown look foolish.\"\n\nSo the next night, the master of ready wit and stunning repartee went to the circus, and got a front row seat. Being an intelligent man, he was considerably less impressed by the sight of dumb animals being made to do tricks, although he had to admit that the trapeze artists were rather tasty.\n\nThen the clowns came out, and the one with the biggest shoes, baggiest trousers, brightest make-up and most ludicrously over-sized nose looked around the audience for someone to make fun of. He could not believe his luck. There, sitting in the front row, was the stupid man he'd got such a laugh out of the night before. So the clown approached the master of ready wit and stunning repartee and asked:\n\n\"Sir, are you the front end of an ass?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the master of ready wit and stunning repartee.\n\n\"Sir, are you the back end of an ass?\" the clown continued.\n\n\"No, I'm not,\" replied the master of ready wit and stunning repartee.\n\n\"Then, sir,\" said the clown, \"you are no end of an ass!\" The crowd went wild with laughter. The joke went down even better than it had the night before, and the clown felt on top of the world.\n\nBut just then the master of ready wit and stunning repartee stood up, smiled sadistically and said:\n\n\"Fuck off, you red-nosed bastard.\"",

Just turn on your TV tonight to the Inaugural Ball. You'll see me.\"  Sure enough, I turned on the TV that night, and there was Larry, talking to President Obama with his arm around the guy.\n\nNot long after, I was talking to Larry about how much I like Jennifer Lawrence. Larry said, \"Oh, she's a good friend of mine.\" I said, \"Noooo!\" Larry said, \"C\u2019mon\". He drove me to Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s house, where she opened the door, exclaimed \u201cLarry!\u201d, gave him a big hug and invited us in for drinks.\n\nThis was getting spooky. Larry seemed to know everyone! While at an Arnold Schwarzenegger press conference, just before the Governator started answering questions, he said \"Hey, I see my friend Larry out there!\"\n\nI was already pretty impressed, but then one day, when Larry and I were having drinks and watching the news, Larry saw the Pope on TV and said something about their being friends.  I said, \"You can't know the Pope, too!\"  Larry said, \"Wanna bet?\" \n\nLarry happens to be very well off, so he flew the both of us to Rome. We took a cab to St. Peters Square. We were standing in the big crowd below the balcony of the Pope's apartment. Larry said, \"Excuse me for a little while\" and disappeared into the crowd.\n\nA little while after that, Pope Francis appeared on the balcony and started blessing people. And who should be up there beside him but...you guessed it\u2026Larry!\n\nI was utterly amazed! I nudged a guy standing next to me, pointed to the balcony, and said, \"Look!\"  The guy shaded his eyes with his palm, peered up at the balcony, turned back to me, and said, \"Who's that guy up there with Larry?\"\n",

And only the pope can save the day.\n\nWell, so thinks Richard Nixon.\n\nSee, he'd been up all night watching *The Shoes of the Fisherman*, and it was such a harrowing vision that he was determined that the pope, and only the pope, could broker a deal between two hostile nations. If you've not seen *The Shoes of the Fisherman*, it's a fine film with Anthony Quinn and there's international problems solved by the pope. \n\nAnyways, Nixon rings up the Vatican and convinces the pope that he has to come to New York to visit the UN. Due to the tenuous situation, this visit has to be utterly secret. \"It's *brrrrrrrrrrr* gotta be secret your holiness!\" They've got a room for him at the Waldorf, it'll be a one day visit. Get in, get out, get a t-shirt.\n\nThe pope, who hadn't been to America in a good long while, accepts this mission. He throws on his red hat and cape, and he hustles to a cab stand.\n\n\"Where to?\" asks the cabbie. The pope stammers, \"just...just get me to Roma International please.\"\n\nThey drive in silence, and the cabbie looks in his rearview.\n\n\"Heyyyy...now wait-a minute! (the cabbie has an Italian accent. This isn't easily explainable) I a-know you! You..you're a famous man!\"\n\nThe pope, terrified of breaking his cover before he's even left Rome, looks away and mutters, \"No, no I'm not, must be someone else.\"\n\n\"Noooo! I a-seen you on the tv! Red hat...red cape...OH! You are Elvis Presley!\"\n\n\"I assure you, I am not Elvis Presley!\" says the pope, feelings a little hurt.\n\n\"Yes-a you are! You do the shuffles and the music, oh my wife gonna be so jealous!\"\n\nThe pope scuttles out of the cab at the airport and hurries to the ticket counter. He orders a round trip to JFK, and the man at the ticket counter looks up and gasps.\n\n\"Signore! Don't I know you? Mama mia, I seen you on television last night!\"\n\n\"No, sir. I assure you I'm nobody of any importance.\"\n\n\"Yes you are! You got the cape...you got the hat...oh madonna you are ELVIS PRESLEY!\" He starts to squeal and hit the counter.\n\n\"SIR! PLEASE! Just...just get me a ticket to JFK!\"\n\nOn the plane. \n\nPope's got his bible out, going over some choice passages, and the stewardess bringing coffee nearly drops it in his lap, crying, \"Elvis! Elvis Presley is on my plane!\"\n\nThe pope hisses at her to be quiet and could she please bring some more peanuts.\n\nHarried and exhausted, he gets a cab at JFK. \"Waldorf Astoria, please.\"\n\nThe cabbie, and we're talkin' the quintessential Brooklyn cabbie here, chews on his cigar and lifts his cap and says, \"Sweet Jesus on a bus to Greenpoint! You're famous, ain't ya?\"\n\nThe pope is nearly reduced to tears at this point. The cabbie continues. \"You got dat red hat! You got the fancy uptown lady cape, only one man has the balls to carry that off, you're Elvis Presley!\"\n\nAt the Waldorf, it all happens again. The clerk says, \"here's the key to your room!\" And in a sotto vocce whisper that echoes across the lobby, \"*..mister Presley*!\"\n\nThe pope goes up to his room. He wishes the president had never watched *The Shoes of the Fisherman*. He turns the key in the lock.\n\nTwo young chambermaids are making up his room. They spin to face him and erupt in shrieks. \"Oh my god! It's....it's....ELVIS!\" One flops on the bed and the other starts to slowly unlace her uniform.\n\nThe pope looks down, buries his head in his hands, comes up and says,\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u266b Wiiiiiise...\n\nmennnn.....\n\nsayyyyyyyy...\u266b",

Officers took note and made sure their soldiers did their jobs correctly given the new responsibilities.\n\nIn 2015, more budget cutbacks caused the MOSs to only be available to the officer core. All of the titles have been combined to a single position typically filled by a single lieutenant.  Every unit gets only one of these types of computer science officers. When the army needs support for hardware, software or any other computer type support they call the Software, Hardware, Information Technology, Industry Fiber-optic Installation & Networking Officer or SHITIFINO for short.\n",

He went up to the bartender and said, \"Bartender, I'd like to buy the house a round of drinks.\"\n\nThe bartender said, \"That's fine, but I'll need to see some money first.\"\n\nThe guy pulled out a huge wad of bills and set them on the bar. The bartender couldn't believe what he was seeing. \"Where did you get all that money?\" asked the bartender.\n\n\"I'm a professional gambler,\" replied the man.\n\nThe bartender said, \"There's no such thing! I mean, your odds are fifty-fifty at best, right?\"\n\n\"Well, I only bet on sure things,\" said the guy.\n\n\"Like what?\" asked the bartender.\n\n\"Well, for example, I'll bet you fifty dollars that I can bite my right eye,\" he said.\n\nThe bartender thought about it. \"Okay,\" he said.\n\nSo, the guy pulled out his false right eye and bit it. \"Aw, you screwed me,\" said the bartender, and paid the guy his $50.\n\n\"I'll give you another chance. I'll bet you another fifty dollars that I can bite my left eye,\" said the stranger.\n\nThe bartender thought again and said, \"Well, I know you're not blind, I mean, I watched you walk in here. I'll take that bet.\" So, the guy pulled out his false teeth and bit his left eye.\n\n\"Aw, you screwed me again!\" protested the bartender.\n\n\"That's how I win so much money, bartender. I'll just take a bottle of your best scotch in lieu of the fifty dollars,\" said the man.\n\nWith that, the guy went to the back room and spent the better part of the night playing cards with some of the locals. After many hours of drinking and card playing, he stumbled up to the bar. Drunk as a skunk, he said, \"Bartender, I'll give you one last chance. I'll bet you five hundred dollars that I can stand on this bar on one foot and piss into that whiskey bottle on that shelf behind you without spilling a drop.\"\n\nThe bartender once again pondered the bet. The guy couldn't even stand up straight on two feet, much less one. \"Okay, you're on,\" he said.\n\nThe guy climbed up on the bar, stood on one leg, and began pissing all over the place. He hit the bar, the bartender, himself, but not a drop made it into the whiskey bottle.\n\nThe bartender was ecstatic. Laughing, the bartender said, \"Hey pal, you owe me five hundred dollars!\"\n\nThe guy climbed down off the bar and said, \"That's okay. I just bet each of the guys in the card room a thousand bucks each that I could piss all over you and the bar and still make you laugh.\"",

James agreed to accompany her on this journey.\n        After 3 years of traveling they had finaly traveled far enough to spread the message of Jewdaism around them. It took 7 more years of teaching for James to grow tired again. By this point James was old. 80 years, and not many left in this life time. He grew restless needing to do more with his life. He asked around the community again but found no solace In any of the ideas he heard. Until one day a mysterious man walked into his synagogue.\n          The man was old but not as old as James. Perhaps 60 or so. He collapsed onto the pew closest to the front. James hurried over to see the man, and realized he was very pale, sickly, and weak. \"What's wrong dear man? Why do you look so shabby?\"\n      The man opened his eyes a little and said \"I have to keep going..... I have to find them. God told me too!\"\n     James was very confused, \"what do you need to find? What is it?\"\n   The man opened his eyes very wide and said, \"The trax! You must find the Trax Tree! The... the fruit of... the....\" The man faded off, his eyes signaling sleep was coming, and fast\n    James ran to get some water and splashed it on the man's face. He sat up a little and gasped\n   \"THE TRAX! FIND IT! PLEASE! IT'S OUR ONLY HOPE!\" the man said, using every drop of energy he had. He slipped off into a very deep sleep that he could not be woken from.\n    James knew this was a message from god. He gathered his things, and set off to find the Trax, whatever it was. It took him a full month to find anyone who knew what he was talking about. \n     \"It's at the top of this mountain old man, but you'll never make it there. And even if you did you'd never get a piece of its fruit. It's guarded you know. You'll die first.\" \n       James did not like this man, he thought he was a pessimist that lacked faith. James wanted to be gone from this small town and get the Trax, so he set off up the mountain \n       It was a hard climb that took James nearly a week to complete. He could've made it sooner but, he was no young man anymore. He crested the last hill and saw what he was looking for. A massive tree bearing large blue and purple fruit, with bright red stems. He saw perfection in those fruit. This tree had been sent from God himself, he knew it.\n     As James approached the tree a harsh laugh echoed in the valley around him. A large troll walked out from behind the tree brandishing a long heavy club. He looked at James and declared: \"YOU CAN NOT HAVE ANY OF THESE FRUIT PUNY HUMAN! HA HA HA!\"\n    \" I've spent the last part of my life searching for this Tree. Why can I not have a piece?\" James asked desperately:\n\n  [The Troll replies] (/s \"\"silly Rabbi, Trax are for kids!\"\")",

It was rejected by Apple , here is our funny thread going back and forth in the message center.\n\n\n---------------\nSeptember 23, 2015 at 12:39 PM\nFrom Apple\n2.2 Details\n\nWe discovered one or more bugs in your app when reviewed on iPhone running iOS 9 on both Wi-Fi and cellular networks.\n\nSpecifically, no action takes place when we tapped the Share button on each picture.\n\nNext Steps\n\nPlease run your app on a device to identify the issue(s), then revise and resubmit your app for review. \n\n---------------\n\nSeptember 23, 2015 at 12:50 PM\nMe :\nThe device requires that the user have Instragram installed on their device, If Instagram is not installed on the device then they can not share to instagram . Is Instagram installed on your test devices? Their should be prompt that appears detailing this , I will double check , but in the meanwhile I hope this helps to track down the issue.\n\n---------------\n\nSeptember 23, 2015 at 2:20 PM\nFrom Apple\nHello,\n\nThank you for providing this information. Upon further review, we found your app to be in violation of the following guideline:\n\n10.6 Details\n\nWe were required to install Instagram before we could use your app. Apps should be able to run on launch, without requiring additional applications to be installed.\n\nNext Steps\n\nPlease revise your app so that a user can use it upon launch. If your app requires authentication before use, please use methods that can authenticate users from within your app.\n\nWe look forward to reviewing your revised app.\n\nBest regards,\n\nApp Store Review\n\n----------------\n\nSeptember 23, 2015 at 3:52 PM\nMe :\nLOL Technically you can still use the app (just not the share to IG part), I presume users would be clever enough to know that they should probably have Instagram installed to share to Instagram no? Re: Please revise your app so that a user can use it upon launch. If your app requires authentication before use, please use methods that can authenticate users from within your app. Authentication can only take place if the user has Instagram installed . If a user has the Instagram app installed but is not authenticated then upon clicking the sharing button they would be redirected to the Instagram in-app login screen where they would login and then be able to share their newly found quote.\n\n----------------\n\nSeptember 23, 2015 at 6:45 PM\nFrom Apple\n2.2 - Apps that exhibit bugs will be rejected\nHello,\n\nThank you for your response. For your app to become compliant with guideline 10.6 it would be appropriate to update the app to not require the Instagram app.\n\nWe look forward to reviewing your revised app.\n\nBest regards,\n\nApp Store Review\n\n----------------\n\n\nSeptember 23, 2015 at 8:00 PM\nMe:\nLol, This thread is very humorous, an app that shares to Instagram that does not require Instagram , I see the Gods are against us.\n\n Cheers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Over the past few years we have seen an enormous increase in population and to deal with that we have had to expand our walls a great deal. Since the increase in size, we have received a large number of complaints about the traveling distances. To solve the issue, we have decided to hand out a set of wheels to each new member who passes through our gates! But unfortunately since this is a new program, we don't have a lot of rides in stock. This means we have had to come up with a system of determining what kind of wheels each individual shall receive. We have decided that the quality of wheels will be determined by the individuals faithfulness to their spouse in the previous life. Sound fair?\" The three guys all nodded in agreement. St. Peter turned to guy number one and asked, \"Tell me sir, how faithful were you to your spouse?\" guy number one answered, \"I was married to my beautiful wife for 55 years. I fell in love with her the very second I met her and my love only grew stronger every day after. I never once in my life thought about any other woman. Not once. We had a wonderful life together and my heart leaps with joy when I imagine the day she will arrive at these same gates to spend an eternity here with me.\" St. Peter wiped a tear from his eye. \"That was the sweetest thing I have ever heard. You have definitely earned a quality set of wheels.\" The gates opened and a Bentley drove out to meet him. Guy number one danced his way to the vehicle and took off pedal to the metal through the gates and out of sight. St. Peter turned to guy number two, \"You're turn now.\" Guy number two stepped forward, \"Well, I've been married for about 25 years, and for the most part things have been alright. We've had our ups and downs like most married couples do. There was one time that we got into a pretty big fight and I phoned a lady from work and well, you know... Some things ended up happening that I'm not too proud of... But I came clean to my wife about it all and she forgave me. Things had gone pretty smooth since.\" \"Not good not good...\" Peter responded. \"But not the worst I've heard either. Here is your ride.\" The gates opened up and a Jeep drove through to meet him. He shook Peter's hand and made his way over to his new ride. As he cruised off into the distance Peter turned to guy number three, but before he could say anything, guy number three started up, \"Okay I'm just going to come out and be completely honest... I've never been faithful to my wife. We've been married for like 10 years or something, and truthfully I believe I stopped loving her right after our first night alone together. Every week I was sleeping with someone else behind her back and to be honest I don't regret any of it. I hate the dumb slut.\" St. Peter couldn't believe his ears. \"You sir are possibly the most disgusting human being I have ever laid eyes on. Here, take your ride.\" He turned and walked away as a moped puttered along through the gates to meet guy number three.\nA considerable amount of time passed and guys number two and three were enjoying a nice ride around the block together when the spotted guy number one in his Bentley parked up on one of the hills outside of their town. They rode up to say hey but when they pulled up beside him they realized he was crying. \"What the heck is wrong with you?\" asked guy number two. \"My wife arrived today.\" Guy number one answered. \"You should be happy! Now you two can spend your eternities together just like you wanted!\" shouted guy number three. \"No, you don't understand...\" said guy number one. \"She's riding around on roller skates.\" ",

Okay, tell you what - here's 100 toothbrushes. Come back at the end of the week and if you sold them all, I'll make you a senior salesman.\"\n\nThat evening, the midget comes back with $100. The manager is amazed, but suspicious. \"Okay, this is pretty insane. I'll give you 1,000 toothbrushes, and if you can sell them all by the end of the week, I'll make you the regional sales manager.\" The midget comes back the next morning with $1,000. The manager shakes his head \"I can't believe it, but I'm a man of my word. I'll set you up in a corner office with a signing bonus and your own assistant and a company car. But first, you have to tell me the secret to your success.\"\n\n\"Come witf me,\" the midget says. They get into the midget's car with  giant box of toothbrushes. The manager notices a large bag of potato chips and jars of hummus on the back seat. \"What're those for?\" \"You'll thee.\" They head to the airport.\n\nThe midget gets out, grabs the chips and dip, a sign and the box of toothbrushes, and wheels a luggage cart with all this stuff to the terminal. The manager follows him \"you sure you don't need any help?\" \"No, fhank you. I got thif.\" The midget stands near the baggage claim with the sign that the manager now sees says \"FREE CHIPS N' DIP\" - the manager screws up his face, but shrugs it off; he needs to see this master salesman in action.\n\nA man walks past as the midget says \"hello thir, would you like to thry thum dip?\" \"Oh, thank you!\" The man takes a chip, dips it into the hummus, and takes a bite. \"WHAT THE FUCK THIS DIP TASTES LIKE SHIT!\"\n\n\"It ith shith - wanna buy a toofbruth?\"",

So he starts drinking.\n\nAs he drinks he gets a bit relaxed and notices an odd thing. The bar is FULL of people of different ages. You have kids, teens, young adults, middle aged and all other ages around. Then there are also people from different races. Lots of races. In fact some of which he doesn't even recognize (aliens?). Amazed at this cultural diversity he figures that the group, as a whole, might be quite knowledgeable.

And as he speaks he tries to start a discussion with the people around him.\n\nHe starts, **\"I woke up early today... because today was going to be a very special day.. You see I fucking love bacon and I-\"**\n\n\"I fucking LOVE bacon!\" echoes the guy sitting next to him loudly. \n\nAt this the woman in the next table shouts \"Well, I fucking love BACON (BAKING) bacon\", starting a pun train.\n\nAnother guy immediately shouts \"oh I love your baking, Frankenswine\".\n\nA guy from the opposite corner chimes-in \"This is why I bring home the bacon!\". And by this time people have randomly begun to join in - each creating a pun train.\n\n\"I love you too HAMLET\"\n\n\"Watch out she's a PIGpocket\"\n\n\"Waiter! I would like to order a really Jurassic PORK\"\n\n\"Guys! guys! Let's not HAM Bush this pooor man. He was saying something! Let's hear him out!\"\n\nSilence. Our man is surprised and annoyed by this sudden insensitive outburst but decides to ignore it and give it another go. This time he decides to skip the topic of bacon altogether and starts with a different one. By this time about half of the people around ignore him and go busy into their own work.\n\n**\u201cMy mama today really hates chocolate. You see my papa has a chocolate factory and this is causing a problem in the family. Ever since he -\u201d** Interrupted.\n\n*Slow clap*\n\n\u201cAm I the only one here to think there's nothing wrong in hating chocolates?\u201d shouts a guy right next to his ear. This starts a commotion again and everyone pitches in their thoughts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s a human or a troll\u201d \n\n\u201cDad has a chocolate factory - Nothing wrong with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBreak off the relationship with both your mom and dad. You have given them enough chances\u201d\n\n\u201cThis sounds so fake you karma whore\u201d\n\n\u201cGrow up you fucking piece of shit\u201d\n\n\u201cYo mama so dirty she makes mud look clean.\u201d\n\nAnd this again starts a whole battalion of Yo Mama insults and puns.\n\nNow our man gets really annoyed. By this time another remaining half of the people have stopped listening to him. He shouts loudly at the top of his lungs, **\u201cFUCK IT! YOU ALL MISSED IT AGAIN!\u201d**\n\nAnd the bartender instantly retorts back \u201cTHAT\u2019S WHAT SHE SAID!\u201d",

Finally, after all his searching, he pulls back the massive rug beneath the bed to find an odd metal piece. \"This has to be the bug,\" he decides and goes about pulling it apart. Now that his wife is relieved and feels safe, he comes back to bed so they can have a blissful night of sleep.\n\nThe next morning, they are woken to the bellhop bringing them breakfast. As he serves them, he asks, \"Did you have a pleasant sleep? Were you okay through the night? Did anything weird happen to you?\" Both assure him that they had a wonderful night, and no, nothing strange happened.

When he finally gains the strength to speak again, he thanks them, and proceeds to tell them his story - how he's a failed businessman, how his wife divorced him, how he got drunk and decided, in drunken stupor, to drive as far away as he could and get lost in the mountains. As he tells his story, he realizes that he has nothing to go back to, and decides, seeing the kind-heartedness of the monks and how they seem to be happy with the little that they have, to become one of them. The monks happily tell him to pick one of the empty beds in the bedroom, assign him a place at their dining table, and hand him three simple brown robes. \n\nThen, they send him to study, as he knows little of the monks' religion, and so he spends an entire day and an entire night in the monastery's library, out of pure curiosity at first, and then inable to quench his thirst for wisdom. The next morning, the monks arrive to find their new brother passed out. They wake him up, and, seeing that he's truly worthy of becoming one of them, send him to the chapel, along with brother Bergus.\n\nAs they make their way to the chapel through the monastery's many corridors, Bergus explains to the newcomer that he's ready for his first ritual, that it would be hard and potentially painful, but ultimately, worth it. The man simply nods.\n\nThe pair sits down on a wooden bench in the chapel, and Bergus continues his explanation: \"You'll now have, if you're strong enough, an experience which will be unlike anything else you've ever had. Try to sit still and focus\". As he says these last words, a choir starts singing, in a language strange and unknown to the man, it's sounds echoing from the chapel's walls. He closes his eyes and tries to let go.  \nFor two hours, nothing happens. The man, however, has learned to deeply trust the monks, and decides to keep on waiting - and suddenly, carried by the voices, his eyes still closed, he finds himself slowly, but surely losing the bench's touch. \n\nA strange, floating sensation overcomes him, and he feels like what he imagines drifting through space must be. As he excitedly opens his eyes, he drops to the floor - but finds himself in the middle of nowhere, not recognizing a single detail of the landscape around him. In fact, it's not even an actual landscape - it seems that the place he's in is just a giant, grey plateau made out of stone, extending seemingly forever to his left, right, and front. Behind him, however, the man sees nothing but a black abyss, so dark that it swallows the plateau's wall within a few meters of depth.\n\nThe man turns around again and decides to explore his surroundings. He walks into the same direction for hours, while his environment seemingly doesn't change in the slightest - until he sees something that seems to be a tiny, grey speck of dust on the grey horizon. As he draws closer, he realizes that it's a small mountain, no more than 1'000 feet in height, with a rocky path gently spiraling upwards around it, leading to the mountain's tip.\n\nThe man, now curious, decides to go up.\n\nAs he, after hours, finally arrives at the top, he sees nothing but another plateau, though this time a lot smaller, round and not more than a couple of meters in diameter. In its middle is a white sphere of light, slowly and invitingly floating up, down, and back up again. The man decides to touch the sphere, but instead finds his hand gliding through it, entering something warm and incredible. Within seconds, he decides to enter the sphere - and from the very moment he steps in, he finds something that he later could only describe as \"molten happiness\" surrounding him in a soft cocoon, slowly spinning around him and making him truly feel the best he's ever felt.\n\nAs he finally fully embraces the sensation, it suddenly slowly starts fading away, and within moments, he finds himself sitting on the chapel's cold floor again. His mouth agape, he turns around, and sees brother Bergus still sitting on the bench nearby, with a kind smile on his lips. Seeing that the man seems to have finished his journey, Bergus gets up, slowly and with soft steps approaches the man, and, as he leans down and brings his mouth towards the still stunned man's ear, whispers: \"420 praise it\".",

The human resources manager tells him, \"You will be hired at minimum wage of $5.35 an hour. Let me have your e-mail address so that we can get you in the loop. Our system will automatically e-mail you all the forms and advise you when to start and where to report on your first day.\"\n\nTaken back, the man protests that he is poor and has neither a computer nor an e-mail address.\n\nTo this the manager replies, \"You must understand that to a company like ours that means that you virtually do not exist. Without an e-mail address you can hardly expect to be employed by a high-tech firm Good day.\"\n\nStunned, the man leaves. Not knowing where to turn and having $10 in his wallet, he walks past a farmers' market and sees a stand selling 25 lb. crates of beautiful red tomatoes. He buys a crate, carries it to a busy corner and displays the tomatoes. In less than 2 hours he sells all the tomatoes and makes 100% profit. Repeating the process several times more that day, he ends up with almost $100 and arrives home that night with several bags of groceries for his family.\n\nDuring the night he decides to repeat the tomato business the next day. By the end of the week he is getting up early every day and working into the night. He multiplies his profits quickly.\nEarly in the second week he acquires a cart to transport several boxes of tomatoes at a time, but before a month is up he sells the cart to buy a broken-down pickup truck At the end of a year he owns three old trucks. His two sons have left their neighborhood gangs to help him with the tomato business, his wife is buying the tomatoes, and his daughter is taking night courses at the community college so she can keep books for him.\n\nBy the end of the second year he has a dozen very nice used trucks and employs fifteen previously unemployed people, all selling tomatoes. He continues to work hard.\n\nTime passes and at the end of the fifth year he owns a fleet of nice trucks and a warehouse that his wife supervises, plus two tomato farms that the boys manage. The tomato company's payroll has put hundreds of homeless and jobless people to work. His daughter reports that the business grossed over one million dollars.\n\nPlanning for the future, he decides to buy some life insurance.\nConsulting with an insurance adviser, he picks an insurance plan to fit his new circumstances. Then the adviser asks him for his e-mail address in order to send the final documents electronically.\n\nWhen the man replies that he doesn't have time to mess with a computer and has no e-mail address, the insurance man is stunned, \"What, you don't have e-mail? No computer? No Internet? Just think where you would be today if you'd had all of that five years ago!\"\n\n\"Ha!\" snorts the man. \"If I'd had e-mail five years ago I would be sweeping floors at Microsoft and making $5.35 an hour.\" Which brings us to the moral of the story:\n\nSince you got this story by e-mail, you're probably closer to being a janitor than a millionaire.\n\nSadly, I received it also.

I go over to him and start slamming his fingers with my fists. He doesn't even budge; so I start stomping on his fingers. Nothing! Eventually I grab a hammer from my tool bag and start breaking every finger until he falls. The fucker landed in some bushes and lived!

As I started climbing again he began to stomp on my fingers. I was mere moments from dropping, and he stopped again. I tried to climb yet again, only to have my fingers broken with a hammer! I had to let go, and fell for what seemed forever. I landed on some bushes, I think, and realized that I was more-or-less okay!

The young cock saw the old rooster, \"Well, it won't be long before you're headless on the old farmer's dinner table, will it?\" he mocked. The old rooster was furious. Sure he was getting on in his years, but he still had plenty of bullets in his gun as it were. Yet he feared he could not compete with the young, athletic cock, and as soon as the farmer saw the hens had made their choice he knew his neck would certainly be at risk.\n\n\"So, you think you're all that, do you?\" said the old rooster.\n\n\"And so much more,\" laughed the young one as he strutted circles around the old.\n\n\"Ha! I've got more juice in my left wing than you have in your whole lineage,\" said the old. \n\n\"You're kidding right?\" laughed the young cock. \"Look at you, I could take you down while blindfolded, upside down, with one leg tied behind my back!\" \n\nThe old rooster angrily stepped up to the young cock, \"Let's do it then! Ten times around the coop. Whoever loses gets the hen-house all to themselves!\" \n\nThe young cock pushed back, \"You're on! But I'll do you one better. I'll give you a five lap head start, but whoever loses leaves the farm forever!\" The old rooster hadn't thought about this. Losing the hen-house was one thing, but leaving the farm, his home, was a big risk. But this cock needed to go. \n\n\"You're on!\"\n\nThe two roosters lined up at the starting line. It wasn't long before the entire farm got wind of the race and all sorts of animals started crowding around the coop. \"You've got five laps, old man, but you wont make it to seven\" quipped the young cock. The rooster bristled with anger. \n\n\"On your mark,\" called a hen, \"get set... GOOOO!\" The old rooster took off as fast as he could. At one lap he felt good. Two laps, okay. Three, he started to feel the burn. At four he realized that he might not be able to keep this up. At five his opponent was let loose and the farm animals erupted in cheers at the speed and agility of the new cock as he whipped around the corners of the coop. Before the old rooster could make another lap the cock had passed him three times, laughing all the while. The spectator's frenzy grew each time the cock made another pass.\n\nBy this time the farmer heard the ruckus coming from the farmyard and came from the house to see what all the commotion was all about. There he saw his entire livestock gathered around the coop hootin' and hallerin' as the young rooster he had just bought was gaining on the older one. The farmer grabbed his shotgun from inside the door, and just before the young cock overtook the old one for the last time, the farmer blew the young rooster away in a puff of feathers. \n\n\"Goddamit...\" he mumbled to himself, \"That's the third god-damned gay rooster I've bought this week.\"",

Stereotype threat is a social psychology theory that states an individual may experience anxiety when they have the potential to confirm a negative stereotype, thus adversely affecting their performance on a test. For example, women who were explicitly exposed to the stereotype that \"females tend to perform more poorly than men on math tests\" did in fact perform worse than women who took the test under neutral conditions.\n\nSimilarly, researchers have also found that a stereotype boost exists, where an individual performs better when explicitly exposed to a positive stereotype prior to taking a test. For example, Asians tended to perform better on math tests when primed with the stereotype that \"Asians tend to perform better than other races on math tests.\"\n\nThe present researchers were interested in a situation where two conflicting stereotypes might compete with each other. The research design was to simply administer math tests to Asian females - half the group would be primed on the two conflicting stereotypes (Asians are good at math; females are bad at math), while the other half would receive no stereotype priming.\n\nResults were inconclusive, as every research subject reported being involved in a car accident on the way to the lab.",

Got it?!\"\n\n>\"Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am...please no more...\", I pleaded, tears swelling in my eyes.\n\n>After spitting in my face, the wretched she-beast stormed back to where she came, leaving me to slowly catch my breath.  The other customers snickered at me as I attempted to regain my footing, grasping at the shelves to support my weight, my legs still weak with pain.   I'd be lying if I said I wasn't aroused by the sexual humiliation of being emasculated by an angry, troglodytic woman in front of a crowd.  It was kind of hot.\n\n>Anyway, I limped from the store back to my mint green Geo Metro, falling into the driver's seat, exhausted.  I realized I had accidentally stepped in dog shit somewhere between the store and my car, tracking it in; shit in my pants, shit on my shoes, testicles in a coma. What a day.",

I hope you enjoy it:).*\n\n\"Johnny and the Clown\"\n\nJohnny is poor and has been all his life. He doesn't mind it much, except for the fact that every year when the circus comes to town, he never gets to see it. The years pass and every year he watches the circus come and go with a tear in his eye. Then one year as the circus is leaving, he snaps. \"Fuck it,\" he says.\" I'm going to get myself a job so I can see the circus.\"\n\nThe next day he applies for a job at a supermarket stacking shelves. He gets this job and works his heart out. He works every night stacking shelves, earning money. He spends very little, and saves heaps. He is the best worker the supermarket has ever seen. A year passes, and the circus comes to town.\n\nAs soon as the gates to the circus open, Johnny races up, first in line to buy a ticket. the excitement overwhelms him. He walks around the circus. He sees the animals, the freak show, buys a hot dog, plays on the clowns. And then he sees it, what he's been waiting for all these years...The Big Top.\n\nJohnny races into the tent and takes a seat. Pretty soon the tent fills up and the show begins. It's a packed house and the buzz is electric. The dancing horses come out, then the elephants, then everyone's favorite, the clowns. The clowns run around and do their act making everyone laugh. When all this is finished, the head clown picks up a microphone and says \"Now we'd like to pick a member of the audience to help with our show.\"\n\nAll the lights go out and a spotlight circles the crowd. and, as luck should have it, it lands on Johnny. Johnny is ecstatic, he nearly shits his pants with excitement. He can't believe his luck. The head clown comes up to him and says..\n\n\"Hey mister, are you the horse's head?\"\n\n\"No.\" Johnny replies.\n\n\"Are you the horse's ear?\"\n\n\"No\"\n\n\"Are you the horse's tail?\"\n\n\"No\"\n\n\"Well then. You must be the horse's ASS!!!!\"\n\nAnd then whole tent erupts into fits of laughter all at Johnny's expense. Everyone is laughing, except for Johnny. He's as pissed as fuck. He vows then and there that next year, when the circus comes to town, he'll get his revenge on the clown.\n\nAs he's walking home, still fuming from the humiliation that the clown caused, Johnny thinks of ways that he can get back at the clown. Death, violence, poisoning....and then it hits him. Johnny will give the clown a taste of his own medicine. Next year, Johnny will blast the clown with the biggest insult ever!\n\nThe next morning Johnny flips through the phonebook looking for someone who can help him with his revenge. Then he finds an ad.\n\n**INSULT SCHOOL - Sick of being picked on? Come to our school and soon you'll be verbally attacking people with vigor!**\n\n\n'This is just what I need!!!\" says Johnny. So he rings up the school and enrolls the next day.\n\nSo every day Johnny goes to the insult school, studying hard so he can learn the best and most harsh insult so he can get back at the clown. On top of this, he still stacks shelves at the supermarket to get the money for the circus. Day in, day out Johnny works his ass off.\n\nThen his day arrives...\n\nAs soon as the circus opens it's gates Johnny barges to the front of the line, pushing people out of his way. No longer is he a kind, considerate man. He's a pissed off motherfucker hell bent on revenge. He gives the ticket seller the money, snatches the ticket, and storms off.\n\nHe sees all the regular shit. The animals, the freaks, the clowns. He's so excited that he goes into the Big Top an hour before the show starts, just so he can get a good seat. The tent begins to fill up and the show starts...\n\nThe dancing horses come out, Johnny yawns. Then the elephants, Johnny tries to stay awake. And then the act Johnny has waited a year for, the clowns. The clowns run around and do their act making everyone laugh. Johnny wonders why everyone is laughing, it's the same shit they did last year. When all this is finished, the head clown picks up a microphone, exactly the same as last year, and says \"Now we'd like to pick a member of the audience to help with our show.\"\n\nAll the lights go out and a spotlight circles the crowd. and, as luck should have it, again it lands on Johnny. Johnny is sits cool, calm and collected. The head clown comes up to him and says..\n\n\"Hey mister, are you the horse's head?\"\n\n\"No.\" Johnny replies.\n\n\"Are you the horse's ear?\"\n\n\"No\"\n\n\"Are you the horse's tail?\"\n\n\"No\"\n\n\"Well then. You must be the horse's ASS!!!!\"\n\nAnd again the whole tent erupts with laughter. Except for Johnny. He sits there staring straight at the clown, a look of pure evil and hate on his face. The laughter quickly dies down as everyone knows something is going to happen. The crowd watched. \n\nThis is Johnny's moment. He takes a deep breath, looks at the clown and says...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"FUCK YOU, CLOWN!\" ",

The gorilla catcher said to the homeowner, \"This is what's going to happen: I'm going to climb up the tree and use the stick to knock the gorilla out of the tree. The dog is trained to instantly run forward, while the gorilla is laying there stunned, and clamp its teeth around the gorilla's balls.

The doctor's experiments having failed, life proceeded as normally as it could have for the head-only boy. On his 21st birthday, the father decides he's going to take his son out for his first drink.\n\nThey arrive at the local bar and the father gently places his son on a barstool.\n\n\"Bartender! A shot for my son on his birthday!\"\n\nThe bartender pours the shot and the father lifts it to his son's lips. After drinking it, the son miraculously sprouts a torso.\n\nThe old wino at the end of the bar yells, \"Serve him up another, barkeep!\"\n\nAnother shot is poured and given to the boy. He immediately grows a pair of arms.\n\n\"Another!\", shouts the wino.\n\nThe boy holds it himself and drinks; he grows a set of legs.\n\nHe stands up and takes his first shaky steps on his new legs around the bar. Soon he is skipping and jumping, everyone in the bar is cheering; the boy yells, \"Father! I can walk! I can walk!\"\n\nBlind with glee, the boy runs straight out the front door and immediately gets hit by an 18-wheeler, killing him instantly.\n\nThe old wino at the end of the bar rolls his eyes and says, \"Shoulda quit while he was a head.\"",

When the bus starts on it's way the driver says to the hippie, \"I can tell you how you can get that nun to have sex with you\". The hippie says that he'd love to know, so the bus driver tells him that every Tuesday evening at midnight the nun goes to the cemetery and pray's to God. If you went dressed in a robe and glow in the dark paint mask she would think you are god and you could command her to have sex with you. The hippie decides this is a great idea, so on Tuesday he goes to the cemetery and waits for the nun to show up. At midnight sure enough the nun showed up, while she was in the middle of praying the hippie jumped out from hiding and says. \"I AM GOD\" I have heard your prayers and I will answer them BUT ... first you must have sex with me. The nun agrees but asks for anal sex so she might keep her virginity because she is married to the church. The hippie agrees to this and has his way with the nun. After the hippie finishes he stands up and rips off the mask and shouts \"Ha, Ha Ha I'm the hippie!!\" Then the nun jumps up and shouts \"Ha Ha Ha I'm the bus driver!!\"",

I think I saw... what just happened?!?!\" To this, the man looks at her and calmly says \"Well, ma'am, the way the skyscrapers on either side of this building are positioned and with the direction of the wind on certain nights, like tonight, and if only the two windows on opposite sides of the bar are open, the wind currents are strong enough to catch me when I jump out there, and carry me around the building, pulling me in right over there(pointing to both windows in order). It's really a very exhilarating experience.  Try it. You will be fine. Here, watch. \n\nWith that, the man chugs down another pint, runs over to the first window, jumps out. And seconds later, is sucked into the second window. The older woman, sitting there essentially slack jawed, was amazed! She reiterates the man's points about height, and current, and contemplates trying this.\n\nShe finally decides to try. She finishes her 4th martini, walks over to the window,  jumps out, and falls 45 stories to her death. \n\nThe bartender, looks over at the man at the bar, shaking his head and says \"You know, you are a dick when you're drunk, Superman. \"",

Every few days, the Medicrane would lumber into town, muttering under his breath \"Medicrane... Medicrane...\", and snatch one of the villagers and take them to his den.\n\n\nAfter a while of living in abject terror, the villagers went to the village Wise Guy (who was actually still of slightly sub-par intellect) to ask for a solution to their problem.\n\n\"What do we do?\" cried the villagers.\n\n\"...Let's dig a hole!\" shouted the wise guy.\n\n\"Why?\" asked the villagers in unison.\n\n\"...Let's dig a hole!\" shouted the wise guy.\n\n\"OK!\" said the villagers in unison.\n\n\nSo the villagers dug a hole deep and wide along the path that the Medicrane normally took into the village.  Later that evening, the Medicrane lumbered up to the hole, and said in a high-pitched shriek:\n\n\"A HOLE!\" \n\nThen he walked around the hole, grabbed a villager and stole away with him.\n\n\nThe next day, the villagers again approached the wise man.\n\n\"What do we do?\" cried the villagers.\n\n\"...Let's put a loon in the hole!\" shouted the wise guy.\n\n\"Why?\" asked the villagers in unison.\n\n\"...Let's put a loon in the hole!\" shouted the wise guy.\n\n\"OK!\" said the villagers in unison.\n\nSo the villagers found the biggest and fattest loon they could find and placed at the bottom of the hole.\n\nLater that evening, the Medicrane again lumbered up to the hole, and said in a high-pitched shriek:\n\n\"A HOLE! A LOON!\" \n\nThen he walked around the hole, grabbed another villager and stole away with him.\n\nThe next day, the villagers again approached the wise man, this time more wearily and skeptically than before.\n\n\"What do we do?\" asked the villagers doubtfully.\n\n\"...Let's put sugar in the loon!\" shouted the wise guy.\n\n\"Why?\" asked the villagers in unison.\n\n\"...Let's put sugar in the loon!\" shouted the wise guy.\n\n\"OK.\" said the villagers, crestfallen.\n\nOnce again, later that evening,the Medicrane again lumbered up to the hole, and said in a high-pitched shriek:\n\n\"A HOLE! A LOON! **SUGAAAAAAAAAAR**\"\n\nThe Medicrane let out an un-earthly roar as he dove into the hole and started ripping apart the loon to shreds and devouring the sugar.  After he had eaten it all, he noticed that he was trapped in the hole with no way out.\n\nThe moral of this story, my friends, is \"A Loon Full of Sugar makes the Medicrane Go Down.\"\n\n**TL;DR** Awful pun\n",

He screwed up his courage. \n\n\"Well, Holmes... I look at the stars and my first thought is that, given how grand the scale of the heavens is, even to the naked eye, we must be truly insignificant specks in a cosmic entity that may not even know that we are here, let alone care if we live or die. Given that fact, it is foolish of us to assume that life is anything more than a meaningless and incidental phenomenon, destined for casual eradication. Is that not so?\" \n\n\"Yes yes, man, go on, go on! What else?\" Now the detective sounded excited. Watson felt encouraged. \"Well, Sherlock, I must also hazard to say that, as inconsequential as life must be, it also has the fine distinction of bearing sentience. We are the very eyes, ears and souls of creation itself. Our unlikely presence and mysterious origins are as good an argument as any for a grand design to the entire cosmos and where there is design, there may be purpose!\" \n\n\"What else, Watson! What else!\" \n\n\"Think, Holmes! We may be unwitting participants in the greatest experiment the universe has ever conducted! Our puny lives are perhaps but grist for the mill of an experiment conducted by God Himself, the attempted evolution of His heir apparent!\" \n\nAll at once, Holmes let out a great cry of excitement and jumped up to face Watson. \"Watson, my dear Watson! You beautiful, colossal, blithering idiot! You've got it all wrong!\" \nWatson's face fell. Grudgingly he asked, \"well then, what did I miss?\" \n\n\"It's elementary, really.

So that day I went there to catch him. I jumped in our apartment and I've started searching, but I couldn't find him. My half naked wife was screaming at me and I've almost  gave up, when I've looked at the balcony and saw a guy holding on the edge of the balcony with his fingers. How dare he?! So I run to the balcony and I jump on his fingers untill he falls down. Sadly, he landed in the bushes and survived. That made me even more angry, so I've ran inside and tried to find something to throw it at him. Strangely, the first thing I've picked was the fridge. I've pulled it out of the socket, pushed it on the balcony and over the fence. It fell 25 floors down and crushed that guy. Because of my heart condition and excessive anger I've got a heart attack and died.\"\n\n\nSt. Peter is thinking. That man did have a bad day. So he opens the gates of heaven and says \"Welcome to heaven.\" and lets him in.\n\n\nA few moments later another man comes to the gates and he too had to tell about his day. \"You won't believe,\" he starts \"on the balcony of my apartment, on the 26th floor, I was exercising, when I've slipped and fell over the fence. Luckily, I've grabbed the edge with my fingers the balcony one floor below. After that, a psychopath runs on his balcony, that I was hanging on, and start to jump on my fingers untill I fall 25 floors down. I fell in the bushes below, so I didn't die, yet. I was in pain and couldn't move and I've watched that psycho how he pushed a fridge over the balcony, which fell on me. It landed on me and that's how I've died.\"\n\n\nSt. Peter, amused by the story, lets this man through the gates of heaven.\n\n\nA minute later, after the man left, another man comes in front of St. Peter and starts telling his story. \"Imagine this: I was sitting completly naked in the fridge...\"",

The bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press up against the base of your spine. The pressure creates one hell of a headache.

As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, \"How about a new shirt?\" Joe thought for a moment and then said, \"Sure.\"\n\nThe salesman eyed Joe and said, \"Let's see, 34 sleeve and 16-1/2 neck.\" Sure enough, it was an exact fit.\n\nAs Joe adjusted the collar in the mirror, the salesman asked, \"How about new shoes?\" Joe was on a roll and said, \"Sure.\"\n\nThe salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, \"Let's see, 9-1/2 E.\" Again, the salesman was spot on.\n\nJoe walked comfortably around the shop in the new shoes, and the salesman asked, \"How about a new hat?\" Without hesitating, Joe said, \"Sure.\"\n\nThe salesman eyed Joe's head and said, \"Let's see, 7-5/8.\" The hat fit perfectly.\n\nJoe was feeling great. Finally, the salesman asked, \"How about some new underwear?\" Joe thought for a second and said, \"Sure.\"\n\nThe salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, \"Let's see, size 36.\"\n\nJoe laughed, \"No, I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old.\"\n\nThe salesman shook his head, \"Oh no sir, you can't wear a size 34.

He caught her out back trying self induction; fortunately, she had not damaged her solenoid. The two took off on his megacycle and rode across the Wheatstone Bridge into a magnetic field, next to a flowing current , to watch the sine waves. \n\nMicro Farad was very much stimulated by Millie's characteristic curve. Being attractive himself, he soon had her field fully excited. He set her on the ground potential, raised his frequency, lowered her resistance, and pulled out his high voltage probe. When he inserted it in parallel, he short-circuited her shunt. Fully excited, Millie cried out, \"ohm, ohm, give me mho\". As he increased his tube to maximum output, her coil vibrated from the current flow. It did not take long for her shunt to reach maximum heat. Now with the excessive current shortening her shunt, Micro's capacity rapidly discharged \u2013 every electron was drained off. But that was not the end of it. Indeed, they fluxed all night, tried various connections and hookings until his bar magnet weakened, and he could no longer generate enough voltage to sustain his collapsing field. With his battery fully discharged, Micro was unable to excite his tickler, so they went home. A few weeks later, they were merged forever and oscillated happily ever after. ",

The golfer expects this to have only been detrimental, but surprisingly, the ball lands a few feet from the hole! The man decides this frog is good luck and takes it with him in his shirt pocket. The frog keeps giving him advice, and the man eventually turns it to be one of the best games he has had.\n\nThe guy is now convinced this frog is good luck, so he drives out to Vegas, and before he even makes it through the casino floor, the frog says \"ribbit, 21\".

My noble half-brother whose throne I usurped will be killed, not kept anonymously imprisoned in a forgotten cell of my dungeon.\n4. Shooting is not too good for my enemies.\n5. The artifact which is the source of my power will not be kept on the Mountain of Despair beyond the River of Fire guarded by the Dragons of Eternity. It will be in my safe-deposit box. The same applies to the object which is my one weakness.\n6. I will not gloat over my enemies' predicament before killing them.\n7. When I've captured my adversary and he says, \"Look, before you kill me, will you at least tell me what this is all about?\" I'll say, \"No\" and shoot him.\n8. After I kidnap the beautiful princess, we will be married immediately in a quiet civil ceremony, not a lavish spectacle in three weeks' time during which the final phase of my plan will be carried out.\n9. I will not include a self-destruct mechanism unless absolutely necessary. If it is necessary, it will not be a large red button labeled \"Danger: Do Not Push\". The big red button marked \"Do Not Push\" will instead trigger a spray of bullets on anyone stupid enough to disregard it. Similarly, the ON/OFF switch will not clearly be labeled as such.\n10. I will not interrogate my enemies in the inner sanctum -- a small hotel well outside my borders will work just as well.\n11. I will be secure in my superiority. Therefore, I will feel no need to prove it by leaving clues in the form of riddles or leaving my weaker enemies alive to show they pose no threat.\n12. One of my advisors will be an average five-year-old child. Any flaws in my plan that he is able to spot will be corrected before implementation.\n13. All slain enemies will be cremated, or at least have several rounds of ammunition emptied into them, not left for dead at the bottom of the cliff. The announcement of their deaths, as well as any accompanying celebration, will be deferred until after the aforementioned disposal.\n14. The hero is not entitled to a last kiss, a last cigarette, or any other form of last request.\n15. I will never employ any device with a digital countdown. If I find that such a device is absolutely unavoidable, I will set it to activate when the counter reaches 117 and the hero is just putting his plan into operation.\n16. I will never utter the sentence \"But before I kill you, there's just one thing I want to know.\"\n17. When I employ people as advisers, I will occasionally listen to their advice.\n18. I will not have a son. Although his laughably under-planned attempt to usurp power would easily fail, it would provide a fatal distraction at a crucial point in time.\n19. I will not have a daughter. She would be as beautiful as she was evil, but one look at the hero's rugged countenance and she'd betray her own father.\n20. Despite its proven stress-relieving effect, I will not indulge in maniacal laughter. When so occupied, it's too easy to miss unexpected developments that a more attentive individual could adjust to accordingly.\n21. I will keep a special cache of low-tech weapons and train my troops in their use. That way -- even if the heroes manage to neutralize my power generator and/or render the standard-issue energy weapons useless -- my troops will not be overrun by a handful of savages armed with spears and rocks.\n22. I will maintain a realistic assessment of my strengths and weaknesses. Even though this takes some of the fun out of the job, at least I will never utter the line \"No, this cannot be! I AM INVINCIBLE!!!\" (After that, death is usually instantaneous.)\n23. No matter how well it would perform, I will never construct any sort of machinery which is completely indestructible except for one small and virtually inaccessible vulnerable spot.\n24. I will never build only one of anything important. All important systems will have redundant control panels and power supplies. For the same reason I will always carry at least two fully loaded weapons at all times.\n25. All bumbling conjurers, clumsy squires, no-talent bards, and cowardly thieves in the land will be preemptively put to death. My foes will surely give up and abandon their quest if they have no source of comic relief.\n26. I will not fly into a rage and kill a messenger who brings me bad news just to illustrate how evil I really am. Good messengers are hard to come by.\n27. I will not imprison members of the same party in the same cell block, let alone the same cell. If they are important prisoners, I will keep the only key to the cell door on my person instead of handing out copies to every bottom-rung guard in the prison.\n28. If my trusted lieutenant tells me my Legions of Terror are losing a battle, I will believe him. After all, he's my trusted lieutenant.\n29. If an enemy I have just killed has a younger sibling or offspring anywhere, I will find them and have them killed immediately, instead of waiting for them to grow up harboring feelings of vengeance towards me in my old age.\n30. I will be neither chivalrous nor sporting. If I have an unstoppable superweapon, I will use it as early and as often as possible instead of keeping it in reserve.\n 31. When I capture the hero, I will make sure I also get his dog, monkey, ferret, or whatever sickeningly cute little animal capable of untying ropes and filching keys happens to follow him around.\n32. I will treat any beast which I control through magic or technology with respect and kindness. Thus if the control is ever broken, it will not immediately come after me for revenge.\n33. I will hire a team of board-certified architects and surveyors to examine my castle and inform me of any secret passages and abandoned tunnels that I might not know about.\n34. If it becomes necessary to escape, I will never stop to pose dramatically and toss off a one-liner.\n35. I will never build a sentient computer smarter than I am.\n36. I will design fortress hallways with no alcoves or protruding structural supports which intruders could use for cover in a firefight.\n37. Bulk trash will be disposed of in incinerators, not compactors. And they will be kept hot, with none of that nonsense about flames going through accessible tunnels at predictable intervals.\n38. I will see a competent psychiatrist and get cured of all extremely unusual phobias and bizarre compulsive habits which could prove to be a disadvantage.\n39. If I must have computer systems with publicly available terminals, the maps they display of my complex will have a room clearly marked as the Main Control Room. That room will be the Execution Chamber. The actual main control room will be marked as Sewage Overflow Containment.\n40. No matter how many shorts we have in the system, my guards will be instructed to treat every surveillance camera malfunction as a full-scale emergency.\n41. When my guards split up to search for intruders, they will always travel in groups of at least two. They will be trained so that if one of them disappears mysteriously while on patrol, the other will immediately initiate an alert and call for backup, instead of quizzically peering around a corner.\n42. I will not agree to let the heroes go free if they win a rigged contest, even though my advisers assure me it is impossible for them to win.\n43. When I create a multimedia presentation of my plan designed so that my five-year-old advisor can easily understand the details, I will not label the disk \"Project Overlord\" and leave it lying on top of my desk.\n44. I will instruct my Legions of Terror to attack the hero en masse, instead of standing around waiting while members break off and attack one or two at a time.\n45. If the hero runs up to my roof, I will not run up after him and struggle with him in an attempt to push him over the edge. I will also not engage him at the edge of a cliff. (In the middle of a rope-bridge over a river of molten lava is not even worth considering.\n46. If my weakest troops fail to eliminate a hero, I will send out my best troops instead of wasting time with progressively stronger ones as he gets closer and closer to my fortress.\n47. If I am fighting with the hero atop a moving platform, have disarmed him, and am about to finish him off and he glances behind me and drops flat, I too will drop flat instead of quizzically turning around to find out what he saw.\n48. I will not shoot at any of my enemies if they are standing in front of the crucial support beam to a heavy, dangerous, unbalanced structure.\n49. If I'm eating dinner with the hero, put poison in his goblet, then have to leave the table for any reason, I will order new drinks for both of us instead of trying to decide whether or not to switch with him.\n50. I will not use any plan in which the final step is horribly complicated, e.g. \"Align the 12 Stones of Power on the sacred altar then activate the medallion at the moment of total eclipse.\" Instead it will be more along the lines of \"Push the button.\"\n51. My vats of hazardous chemicals will be covered when not in use. Also, I will not construct walkways above them.\n52. If a group of henchmen fail miserably at a task, I will not berate them for incompetence then send the same group out to try the task again.\n53. I will not design my Main Control Room so that every workstation is facing away from the door.\n54. I will not ignore the messenger that stumbles in exhausted and obviously agitated until my personal grooming or current entertainment is finished. It might actually be important.\n55. If I ever talk to the hero on the phone, I will not taunt him. Instead I will say this his dogged perseverance has given me new insight on the futility of my evil ways and that if he leaves me alone for a few months of quiet contemplation I will likely return to the path of righteousness. (Heroes are incredibly gullible in this regard.)\n56. If I decide to hold a double execution of the hero and an underling who failed or betrayed me, I will see to it that the hero is scheduled to go first.\n57. When arresting prisoners, my guards will not allow them to stop and grab a useless trinket of purely sentimental value.\n58. My door mechanisms will be designed so that blasting the control panel on the outside seals the door and blasting the control panel on the inside opens the door, not vice versa.\n59. My dungeon cells will not be furnished with objects that contain reflective surfaces or anything that can be unraveled.\n\nEdited to Add: I did not have a source for this joke, I didn't even know a source existed for this joke as it was posted to a friends Facebook wall with no sourcing and I just figured it was one of the countless list jokes going around the internet.

It's his boss and he tells the businessman to get to the airport in an hour for a very important deal which he cannot refuse. The wife loses her shit and the business man knows he cant stay but he tells her he will make it up to her somehow. He gets in the car and starts to drive to the airport. On the way he is freaking out knowing his wife is going to do something crazy while he's away. He stops at a red light and looks over to see a sex shop. A lightbulb goes off in his head and he parks and runs into the store. The little bell rings as he enters and he looks around. DVD's, whips, chains, lube, latex suits, mask, dildo. The man is completely overwhelmed so he rings the bell at the counter. A woman walks out from the back and the businessman asks for the most expensive item they carry in the store and that the price is of no concern. The lady take a box out from under the counter, it is covered in dust which she blows off and she opens it. Inside is a piece of wood, whittled into the crude shape of a cock. The businessman looks at the item, perplexed and confused and asks WTH is it suppose to be and how much does it cost. The lady says it is the legendary voodoo dick and it will cost him over 5000$. The businessman becomes outraged and asks why that pathetic looking wooden dildo is 5000$ and the dildo under the counter with a lube dispenser, rotating head and twelve speeds costs only 200$  the lady tells him the powers of the voodoo dick are not to be underestimated and gives him a demonstration. She leans in and tells the voodoo dick to fuck the female customer by the dvd rack. The voodoo dick starts to float out of the box the flies full speed across the store, up the womans dress and starts to fuck her silly, knocking DVD's all over the ground. She tells the voodoo dick to stop fucking the female customer and it flies back into the box and the lid magically closes. The business man slaps the money on the counter and buys it right away. He rushes home and gives his wife the gift and instructions then leaves for the airport, confident he just saved his marriage. For the first day the wife just looks at the box insulted her husband would get her a dildo. The second day she has some thoughts about using it but doesn't and on the third day she is watching Dr.Phil and decides 'fuckit' then brings the box into the bedroom and gets on the bed and takes the voodoo dick out of the box. She tells the voodoo dick to fuck her and it flies right into her pussy and gives her five orgasms in a minute. She cant take it anymore and tells the voodoo dick to stop but it continues its rampage inside her vagina. She freaks out and tries to put her clothes back on but she falls all over the place, when she finally manages to do that she goes into the garage and tries to get into her car. Fumbling and dropping her keys a few times she gets in and drives as fast as she can to the hospital. She is swerving and speeding until she sees the cherries of a cop car in her rearview mirror. She pulls over and this state trooper looking cop comes up to her window and taps on the glass with his flashlight. She rolls down her window and the cop asks her why she was speeding and tells her she could've killed someone, he demands to know an explanation for all of the reckless driving and she tells him about the voodoo dick. The cop looks at her with a stern expression, takes off his glasses, looks her right in the eyes and goes\n\"Voodoo dick my ASS\" ",

We've all seen those \"tic tacs\" you carry around!\nNot to mention it's not that impressive, you've not exactly tested your sexual potential! If you had gone on a fetish spree with multiple partners of age and gender then that might be worthy of praise, because then, you would be breaking down pathetic social barriers created by religious twats to convince everyone to buy their book or die!\n\nThe best metaphor that comes to my mind is a party with a fruit basket, and one guy insists on sticking his penis in the pomegranate constantly, not trying any of the apples or bananas! AND HE WON'T EVEN LICK THE POMEGRANATE!\n\nEveryone knows, the best way to take on a pomegranate, is to lick it until all it's juices squirt all over your face!\n\nI think a good way to rectify this whole issue, is that we stop slut shaming, and start sex applauding or something, I love the idea of a world were we can start handing out medals when it's appropriate!\n\n\"I've had sex with all sorts of men and women!\"-a woman\n\"Here is your trophy madam!\"\n\nSo lets stop demeaning sex, because sex is awesome! \n\n..So I'm told ...\n:(\n\n*I hope you enjoyed this idea for a routine of mine, I thought about posting it in a comedy forum or something but it looks like this subreddit may be the most appropriate place for it!

He grabs a soda and comes back. \n\nThe rabbi notices there aren't any more snacks, so he tells the rest that he'll go and grab some. \"Hang on,\" says the minister, \"I'll drive us back to the beach.\" \"No need,\" the rabbi replied, \"I can walk on water too.\" He looks up, prays, and jumps off the boat and falls into the water. As he climbs back onto the boat, the priest looks at the minister and says \"Should we have told him where the rocks are?\"",

The emperor, Akhum Ers\u00e9, has run into a problem.\n\nA problem--one that would never occur in the current efficient leadership of the great Kim Jong Un due to his unparalleled guidance in generating happy and satisfactory employment to the citizens of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea--that involved some very unsatisfied lumberjacks.\n\nThe lumberjacks would get pay on a log-by-log basis, thus paving the way for the concept of Employee Stock Ownership Plans for the current administration of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, where all employees are paid for the work they do fairly.\n\nHowever, they were not satisfied with their pay, where they got 15 rekhtas on the brumhi. They wanted an increased pay of 25%, something that the king was unwilling to give due to the dent it would put in the king's personal finances, which our dear leader Kim Jong Un would never do, as he respects the work of the laborers of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and is a humble servant to the nation.\n\nHowever, Ers\u00e9 came up with an innovative solution to the problem, as the resultant lack of firewood for the masses would mean that dry foods would be more popular, something that would be unfavorable to him; he held a huge stake in cooked food raw producers' income.\n\nAn atheist and rationalist, Ers\u00e9 understood completely the power of religion over the people, something our dear leader Kim Jong Un would never use to deceive the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as he cares about our spiritual wellbeing. Ers\u00e9 created a religion with some 60-something year old soldiers whom he gave the most expensive of silk robes.\n\nThe beards of the men displayed a kind of mystique to the people, and the words they spoke enchanted the masses, which led to several men who gladly put themselves under the tutelage of the \"monks\".\nAs initiation and daily ritual, the men were given a saw and made to chop trees the whole day. If their faiths were true, they would go to the area the next day and the trees would no longer be there! Many joined the faith, believing with all their hearts the tenets of the religion that suspiciously lined up with Ers\u00e9's interests, even as naysayers were systematically abducted and \"reeducated\".\n\nErs\u00e9 died of a heart attack sparked by an oily treat. The treat was banned in the whole kingdom by his throne-inheriting son Krasy. Due to the indoctrinating that was still prevalent in the kingdom, Ers\u00e9's death was widely mourned, and he was celebrated as a Godly ruler.\n\nEvery year since then to the death of the religion, the men who served assembled in 6 to 10 acres of forest and sang and danced and chopped trees on Ers\u00e9's birthday. It was a saw sage fest.\n",

One day he finally got fed up with his repetitive, insignificant life and decided that he would leave his hive, his family, his entire close-knit wasp community and he would go out into the world and make something of himself, just like the humans do. So the wasp enrolls in school, and passes with flying colors. Remember, this is a very smart wasp. He gets his high school diploma in a little under 3 years, with a 4.0 GPA and all that snazz. After high school, believe it or not, the wasp gets accepted to Harvard. Harvard! This too proves to be no challenge for our hero, as he graduates in just two years, again a 4.0, on the Dean's list, and all that snazz. Not to mention all the clubs and sports he was in-the newspaper, rowing, student government-and the fact that he was by far the most popular student on campus. Even his professors looked up to him. \nHe goes on to get two PhDs, and when he finishes his education, the wasp faces a bit of a dilemma. How does he apply his knowledge now? Where does he go from here? He decides to try out politics. After all, he was popular throughout school, did well in Harvard government. So he runs for mayor, and wins in a landslide. He greatly reforms the city, fixing virtually all its major problems. He runs for governor and again wins in a landslide. Two years later, the presidential election was coming up, and the wasp decides he might as well go for it. \nOf course, he wins in the largest landslide in US presidential history. His presidency goes exceedingly well-he is loved by all parties, and has the highest approval ratings in history. He also finds the cures for cancer, AIDS, and broken hearts while in the White House. After 8 years (yes, of course he was reelected) the time has come for him to leave his office. Even his successor his saddened by the wasp\u2019s departure, but they all know it\u2019s what must be done. Back at his vacation home in California his first day after leaving office, the wasp looks back on his long and fruitful life. He realizes that he hasn't been back to his hive at all since that first day he left. He suddenly feels a twang of guilt as he realizes how much he misses his parents and his little brother. So he heads back to the hive, looking more worn out than he remembers. He goes inside and greets his family, who are overjoyed at the sight of him. He talks about how his life has gone as his family listens in wonderment. Eventually he decides he is thirsty, so he decides to visit the old watering hole he remembered. Once he gets there though, there\u2019s an extremely long line. He decides it\u2019s worth the wait, so gets in line. One hour. Two hours. This is the slowest moving line he\u2019s ever seen! Eventually he calculates that it could be a few days before he gets to the front of the line, so decides it\u2019s not worth it. He decides to go get some cider to drink instead, but waddya know, another huge line of people waiting for cider! He remembers one other drinking area that never had a long line-fruit punch! So he decides to go get punch. He arrives, and lo and behold, there's no punch line.",

There had been an accident back stage with one of the female characters and they needed a doctor. The surgeon went to help. When the ambulance arrived the surgeon rode with the injured person to the hospital. The female character was being played by a man but he had phoned in sick so tonight it was a woman. That was what the pamphlet said at the theatre but it was clearly a man in the ambulance. The surgeon called the theatre to confirm who the patient was. The people at the theatre were very confused because the actress playing the female character was still in the dressing room. A male model that had been helping the costume designer was missing so they tried to track him down. They tried to call the model but he did not answer. A mobile phone rang in the ambulance and the surgeon picked it up. It was the theatre manager on the other end. He had left his phone in the pocket of one of the costumes and was calling to locate it. The surgeon asked him about the missing male model. \u2018The last time I saw him was when I sent him to look for my phone\u2019 said the manager. ",

She gets up violently, storms down the hallway and sees the frog sitting neatly on the counter and her husband rummaging in the pantries and cabinets, her kitchen looking like a tornado has just been through it. \"What in *God's name* is going on???\" she asks.\n\nHer husband looks at her, replies: \"If this frog can cook, you're getting the fuck out of here.\"",

If it drops down to get a drink I can swim up and eat it. That would be a nice snack\".\n\nAt the edge of the pond there is a bear, it was watching the fish and the fly. It thinks to itself \"That fly looks thirsty, and the fish watching it looks hungry. If the fly drops down to the surface of the pond for a drink that fish will come up and eat it. When it does I will run out and grab the fish. That would make a nice meal\".\n\nAcross the pond from the bear is a hunter. He notices the bear watching the fish, and the fish watching the fly. He thinks to himself: \"If that fly the fish is watching drops down to the pond for a drink the fish is going to come up and catch it. When it does the bear will jump into the water to grab the fish. I will shoot the bear and have me a nice bear steak for lunch\".\n\nOn a moss-covered log next to the hunter is a partially eaten sandwich. Behind the hunter, hiding under a leaf, is a mouse. The mouse sees the fly above the pond and the fish watching it. He sees the bear watching the fish, and the hunter watching the bear. The mouse thinks: \"If that fly drops to the surface of the pond for a drink the fish is going to swim up to eat it. When it does the bear is going to run out and eat the fish. Then the hunter will shoot the bear. While the hunter is distracted I will run out and grab that sandwich off the log. I will then have a fine meal for my family\".\n\nHiding behind a bush not too far from the mouse is a cat. The cat is watching the fly, the fish, the bear, the hunter, the sandwich, and the mouse. The cat thinks: \"If that fly decides to get that drink the fish is going to go after it. When it does, the bear across that lake will jump in and grab the fish. The hunter will shoot the bear, and the mouse is going to run out and grab the sandwich. When it does I'm going run out and snatch the mouse. That will make a good meal for me\".\n\nWell, as fate would have it the fly dropped down to the lake for a drink. The fish swam up and ate the fly. The bear jumped into the pond and grabbed the fish. The hunter shot the bear, and the mouse ran out to grab the sandwich off the log. The cat ran out to catch the mouse, hit a slippery spot of moss on the log and missed it. The cat ended up in the pond instead.\n\nAll this proves one thing. When a fly drops six inches a pussie will get wet.",

I have such a bad temper, I took the pipe wrench and cracked her head open.\n\nThe priest, hearing that starts to cross himself, but before he can say anything the man continues talking:\n\n-Then the next day I was in her funeral, and it started raining and ruining my suit, so I yelled at the top of my lungs curses against our lord.\n\n-My wife was a little bit vexed by her mother having been killed and all, so she started to call me names, and I had to choke her, because she was getting on my nerves, father.\n\nThe minister, at this point is as white as the pallium of the Virgin, but the man doesn't even take a second and keeps going:\n\n-And today, father, today I was full of remorse for my acts against the law of God and came here to seek forgivness. But when I was boarding the bus, the doors closed on me and I broke the second commandment again.\n\n-The people was staring too much at me, and I really have a bad temper, father, so I doused the bus in gasoline and lighted it on fire with all these people inside.\n\nThe priest is fully terrified, so trying to not provoke the wrath of the man tells him timidly:\n\n+Do not suffer, my son, for God's mercy knows no bounds. Say two... No! one! Say a Hail Mary and you will be forgiven.\n\n-Thank you, father, goodbye!\n\nThe priest sighs with relief as the man is leaving, but as he gets up he hits his head with a figure of the Virgin and starts yelling with a thunderous voice:\n\nRAAAAARGH!!!

Well it works and he is a natural crowd pleaser. People gather around him and he is getting all the attention. This goes on for about 3 or 4 months. One day, the main attraction at the zoo, the gorilla, dies. Shortly after the mime hears this he is called to the zoo's main office. The park manager acknowledges the mime's acting abilities and asks if he would dress up as the gorilla until they find a replacement. The mime gladly accepts. For the first few weeks the mime keeps the title of the zoo's most popular attraction. He swings from vine to vine. Throws banana peels at people, just doing normal gorilla things. Eventually, the crowd starts to dwindle and everyone is going to see the Lions and he loses his title and fears for his job. In a panic he comes up with a plan to become the most popular attraction again. The next day when the zoo opens, he crawls out of his dwelling and over to the lion pit. He starts messing around with them from a tree and throwing rocks at them, really pissing them off. The gorilla throws a rock really hard because its his last one and slips out of the tree. As the Lions come running over, the mime is about to break character and scream. Right before he screams, the lion puts his hand over his mouth and says, \" Do you wanna get us all fired?\"",

God got a bit angry, and said\"look, we've had our difference's in the past, and you know what is right here, so I warn you that if you don't send him up here, I'll be forced to file a lawsuit to MAKE you send him back to my flock!\"  The devil just laughed at God, and then said \" Who will you get to file the petition?...all the lawyers are down here!\"\n",

You'll each get a photo to examine for just five seconds, then you have to tell me what you notice about the subject's appearance.\"\n\nThe chief takes the first applicant into a room and gives him a photo from their mugshot gallery. After five seconds, he says \"so what did you notice about the subject?\"\n\nApplicant #1 thinks for a bit and says \"he only had one eye.\"\n\nThe chief looks at him in disbelief. \"What? No, it's a picture in profile! You can't see the other eye because his head is turned sideways! What an idiot, get out of my station!\" He bellows. Applicant #1 flees.\n\nThe second applicant comes in and the chief gives him the same photo. After five seconds, he barks \"time's up, what did *you* notice about the subject?\" \n\nApplicant #2 hems and haws and finally says \"he only had one ear!\"\n\nThe chief nearly flips the table. \"It's a picture in profile, you brainless buffoon! You just can't see the other ear! Get out of my sight!\" He roars. Applicant #2 takes off as well.\n\nThe third applicant enters tentatively. The chief slaps the photo down in front of him, and after five ~~minutes~~ seconds he growls \"Tell me anything you noticed about the subject!\"\n\nWithout so much as a pause, applicant #3 says \"He was wearing contact lenses.\"\n\nThe chief squints at the picture, but for the life of him he can't tell whether the guy is wearing contacts or not. So he goes and checks the records and sure enough, he wore contact lenses!\n\nThe police chief comes back out beaming and says \"you were right! What amazing powers of observation! You're hired, sign here and I'll go get your new badge.\" So applicant #3 signs his name and the chief soon comes back with the badge. When he does, he shakes #3's hand and says \"I'm curious, how could you tell he was wearing contact lenses? I couldn't tell at all!\"\n\nApplicant #3 smiles and says \"Simple logic--he couldn't have worn regular glasses, since he only had one ear and one eye.\"\n\n",

A few drinks in and I found myself mesmerized by her eyes: one was a very bright blue, similar to mine, but the other one was a vibrant, almost neon violet. I struck up a light conversation with her, and things were going well, until she suddenly unleashed the loudest, most violent sneeze I've ever seen, and her violet eye flew out. With my catlike reflexes and keyboardist dexterity, I reached out and snatched it out of the air, then handed it back to her. \"Thanks,\" she said. \"I should have mentioned I've got a glass eye.\"\n\n\"No worries,\" I said to her. \"It's a great color.\"\n\nShe seemed to warm up to me a lot after that, probably in part thanks to her continued alcohol intake, and when the headlining band finished up their set, I offered to give her a lift home. \"Actually,\" she said, slurring a little and putting one hand up around my shoulders, \"how about you give me a lift back to your place? That sound good?\" I could see where this was going, and I'd always wanted to bend a girl over a grand piano, so I agreed.\n\nShe was into it, let me tell ya. We got into my apartment and spent half the night having some of the best sex I have ever experienced before we finally collapsed from sheer exhaustion at about 4:00 AM.\n\nI woke up shortly after noon the next day to hear bacon sizzling on the stove. I dragged myself out of bed and made my way to the kitchen where I found her preparing bacon and pancakes for breakfast.\n\n\"Will you marry me?\" I mumbled.\n\nShe laughed. \"I'll have to think about it,\" she said, with a wink.\n\n\"Why did you decide to stick around, anyway?\" I said. \"You would have been well within your rights to just take off in the middle of the night and just never see me again.

Now Ivan and his family were dirt poor, in fact they were so poor, that they had to sell the cockroaches and rats they found in their hovel to make some spare change to to feed their many family members. One day Ivan decided it was time to travel to the United States to try and have a better life and he managed to get aboard a ship to the States. Now his journey on this ship was miserable, he was down in the bowels of the ship, which was flooded with rats and feces, but he bunkered down and gave it his all to survive this terrible journey. But one day he hears commotion above, they had arrived. Ivan walks up to the topside of the old ship and sees the New York Harbor. He stands there amazed seeing such a beautiful sight. Ivan starts his life in New York but he doesn't have a significantly better life. He lands himself a gig of selling old newspapers. He goes through garbage cans and find old papers and manages to sell them to people in the poorer part of town. He makes slightly more spare change, but not really enough to live a better life.. In his spare time he decides to start free diving in the bay. He goes there each day, and started to get really good at it. One day, an owner of a Circus spots him diving and is amazed at how good he is. He offer Ivan a job at his circus of doing performance diving. Ivan eagerly accepts and begins his career as a circus member performing amazing high jumps into really small containers of water. After a few months of doing this he suggests to the owner one amazing jump to wow everyone. The Owner agrees and rents a ship much like the one Ivan arrived in and placed the smallest container yet. The radio and tv crews arrived to spectate the event as well. The day arrives and Ivan begins his climb up a massive tower, and the ship is pulled into place beneath him. Ivan is very nervous but decides it's go times and jumps from the massive tower. As ivan descended, a sudden wave pushed the ship ever slightly throwing off the alignment. Ivan falls straight through the top of the ship, and the spectators all gasp and cry out. There is a dead silence, and amazingly, Ivan emerges from the hole in the top of the ship. Reporters are shocked and race to Ivan asking \"How on Earth did you survive that!?\" Ivan looks to the reporters and says \"Throughout my life I have been through many Hardships.\"",

The chief explains how the cannibal society places great value on self control and bravery in the face of pain, and if they can successfully pass a test of bravery they will be allowed to go free.  Otherwise they will be eaten.  The prisoners are removed to a holding area in a nearby cave and brought out one at a time.   Each prisoner, one at a time,  is sent into the forest with instructions to return with three fruits.  Joe is first, and he returns with three cherries.  The chief tells Joe he must now insert the cherries into his rectum, but if he make a sound or so much as a twitch of a facial muscle, he will be killed and eaten at the ceremonial feast.  Joe carefully carries out the instructions and is able to complete the task without betraying any of the pain involved.  He is taken aside and instructed to remain silent upon fear of death.  Next, they bring out Jim who is sent into the jungle for three fruits.  Jim returns with three limes, and is given instructions on what he must do to survive.  He only just manages to get the limes up his ass without a sound or a facial expression.  The last of the campers is then brought out and sent into the forest.  Suddenly the other two start laughing.  The chief is livid and tells them they have doomed themselves to certain death.  Jim says, \"Well, I just couldn't help it when I saw Terry come around the corner with those pineapples!\"",

I just knew the guy was in my apartment, but I couldn't find him. I looked everywhere and was just about to give up, when I went out on the balcony of my 23rd story apartment and there he was hanging over the edge! He was just barely hanging on, there was no way he could climb back onto the balcony. It was a really stupid place to try to hide. I was livid, so I started punching him and clawing at his fingers, but he held on. Finally I went to get a hammer and started pounding on his fingers, and he fell down. But what really angered me was that he landed in some bushes and fell to the ground dazed, but basically OK! I was so mad I grabbed the refrigerator, threw it off the balcony and it landed on him. Unfortunately I was so riled up by the incident I had a heart attack and died.\"\n  \nSt. Peter was taken aback, and said \"While you did die in a dramatic fashion, I think we need to look at that whole second degree murder before we let you in - off to limbo with you.\" He then approached the second man and asked him how he had died.\n  \n\"I was riding my exercise bike on the balcony of my 24th story apartment, when the thing broke and threw me over the railing! I grabbed furiously at the railing and slipped, but managed to catch on the balcony below mine. I tried to climb up but it just wasn't possible. I thought I was going to fall but then someone came out on the balcony. I thought he would help me, until he started hitting me! I held on as best I could, but when he got a hammer and started hitting me I finally couldn't hold on anymore and fell. Somehow, though, I fell in some bushes and fell to the ground dazed, but basically OK! Just as I'm coming around, I look up and BAM this refrigerator lands on me. So here I am.\"\n  \nSt. Peter immediately admitted this second man to heaven, and pulled aside the third man and asked him for his story.\n  \n\"Picture this: I'm hiding naked in a refrigerator...\"",

'What I can do for you is this: I'll show you what's in these three rooms. You need to then choose. But once you've chosen, you can't change your mind. Deal? Ah, what am I saying, I don't care if you like it or not. OK, Door Number 1!'\n\nHe pushes open the door and Phil immediately gags and steps back in disgust. A wave of nausea passes through him as he sees a group of people standing up to their waists in human effluence - not just your regular room of crap either,  this is hardcore recovering-from-a-hangover-level stuff. Perhaps even worse was the low-quality stream of Nickelback's back catalogue playing through tinny mobile phone speakers on the ceiling. \n\n'Not for you?' asks the Devil. 'Oh... ok then. How about Door Number 2?'\n\nPhil didn't think there was anything in the collected history of human experience worse than what he had just seen, but he had to recalibrate when he saw the next room. People were standing up to their necks in post-curry turds; any attempt to raise an arm to wipe their sweating foreheads just splashed the poor soul next to them, who them splashed them back. It was awful. And Frankee's FURB was playing at an uncomfortably high volume.\n\n'Yeah, I'm really not sure why people keep on choosing that room,' said the Devil as he closed the door. 'Alright then Phil, one last door to open.'\n\nWhile still stomach-churning, the room behind Door Number Three was almost pedestrian compared to the last two. Faeces still reached up to the occupants' shins, but they were all stood around drinking coffee - albeit cold - and smoking cigarettes - albeit menthols. The music wasn't half bad either, comparatively speaking. I mean, everyone likes Cher *deep down*, don't they?\n\n'Door Number 3, I choose Door Number 3!' shouted Phil. 'Please oh please make it Door Number 3.'\n\n'Well OK,' replied the Devil, somewhat surprised. 'I mean, if that's your thing. Come on then, in you go.'\n\nA polite shove and Phil was in the room. No one acknowledged him, they were too busy taking long pulls from their cigarettes and frantically drinking their coffee.\n\nThe Cher cut out and was replaced by the Devil's voice. 'OK guys, coffee break's over. Back on your heads, please.'\n\nEdit: hurrrr homophones",

Remembering what he was told in the interview, he begins to lope around on his knuckles and beat his chest.  To his surprise, the crowd starts to grow, and soon the spectators are oohing and pointing and clapping.  Feeling confident, he grabs onto a vine hanging from a tree branch and begins to swing back and forth.  The crowd begins to cheer, so he keeps it up.  Higher and higher he swings, until finally the rope snaps and sends him flying over the fence into the next enclosure.  Dazed, he sits up...and sees a pride of lions stalking towards him, looking at him hungrily.\n\"Help!\" he screams, and begins waving his arms.  \"Help!  Somebody get me out of here!  I'm not really a gorilla!  Don't let them eat me!\"\nSuddenly, one of the lions pounces on the man, opens its jaws and says, \"Shut up, man!  Are you trying to ruin this gig for all of us!?\"",

Jake, who brought a kiwi, begins his deed, and, feeling the fuzzy kiwi skin, bursts out in laughter. He immediately collapses and appears in heaven. Hesitantly, Jim begins his deed. He takes out his fruit of choice- grapes-- and is about to finish without a problem when he explodes in booming laughter. Back in heaven, the two men meet up.\n  Jake asks Jim, \"Why did you die?

While waiting for the light to change, an frail looking old man on a yellow moped pulls up next to him. The old man looks over at the Ferrari and asks, \"What kind of car ya' got there, Sonny?\" \n\nThe young man replies, \"A Ferrari GTO. It cost half a million dollars!\" \n\n\"Wheeewee... that's a lot of money,\" says the old man as he tucks his thumbs up against his suspenders. \"Why does it cost so much?\" \n\n\"Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!\" states the banker proudly. \n\nThe moped driver asks, \"Mind if I take a look inside?\" \n\n\"No problem,\" replies the proud new owner. So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around at all the bells and whistles lining the dashboard. Sitting back on his moped, the old man whistles and says, \"That's a pretty nice car, all right... but I'll stick with my moped!\" \n\nJust then the light changes, so the banker decides to show the old man just what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 160 mph! Suddenly, he notices a yellow dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be getting closer! He slows down to see what it could be, and suddenly... Whoooooosssshhhhh! Something blows by him, going much faster! \n\n\"What in the hell could be going faster than my Ferrari?\" the young man asks himself. He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 250 mph. Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it's the old man on the moped! Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 275 mph. Whoooooosssshhhhh! \n\nHe's feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him again! Dumbfounded, the banker floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 320 mph. Not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again! \n\nThe Ferrari red lines and there's nothing more he can do! Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end. The young man stops and jumps out, and unbelievably, the old man is still alive. He runs up to the mangled old man and says, \"Oh my God! Is there anything I can do for you?\" The old man whispers with his dying breath... \"Unhook... my... suspenders... from... your.... side view mirror.\"",

He had been hearing quite a bit about courting from the other boys, and he wondered just what it was all about. One day he asked his mother, and she became quite flustered. Instead of explaining things to Johnny, she told him to hide behind the curtains later that night and watch his older sister and her boyfriend. So he did this, and the next morning he gave this account of what happened to his mother at the breakfast table:\n\nSis and her boyfriend sat down and talked for awhile. Then he turned off most of the lights and started kissing and hugging her. I figured Sis must be getting sick because her face started to look funny. He must have thought so, too, because he put his hand inside her shirt to feel her heart, just like the doctor does. Except he\u2019s not as good as the doctor \u2019cause he had an awful hard time finding it and kept feeling all over for it.\n\nHe started getting sick, too, \u2019cause pretty soon both of them started panting like Rover and getting all out of breath. His other hand must have been getting cold \u2019cause he put it under her skirt to warm it up. About this time, Sis got toward the end of the couch. This was when the fever started. I know it was a fever because Sis told him she was really HOT.\n\nFinally, I found out what was making them so sick\u2026a big eel had gotten inside his pants, somehow. It just jumped out of his pants and stood there about 9 inches long. Honest!! Anyway, he grabbed it in one hand and her mouth fell open, and she started calling out to God and stuff like that. I should tell her about the ones I saw at the lake!\n\nAnyway, Sis got real brave and tried to kill the eel by biting his head off. All of a sudden, she made a noise and let the eel go\u2026I guess it bit her back. Then she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eel\u2019s head to keep it from biting again.\n\nSis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a scissors lock on it. And he helped by laying on top of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a fight. Oops, sorry, Mom. I know I\u2019m not supposed to say that word. Sis started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squishing it between them.\n\nAfter awhile, they both quit moving and gave a great sigh. Her boyfriend sat up and, sure enough, they had killed the eel. I knew it was dead because it hung there limp and some of its guts were hanging out. Sis and her boyfriend were tired from the battle, but they went on courting anyway. He started hugging and kissing her again. And, by golly, that old eel wasn't dead after all! It jumped straight up and started to fight again. I guess eels are like cats\u2026they have 9 lives or something.\n\nThis time Sis jumped up and tried to kill the eel by sitting on it. After about 35 minutes of struggling, they finally killed the eel for real this time. I know it was really dead \u2019cause I saw Sis\u2019 boyfriend peel off its skin and flush it down the toilet.\n\nDADDY, DADDY, COME QUICK!!!

Make sure you read each of the jokes to the finish! The payoff is great.\n\n**Bob's Brick**\n\nThere's this guy named Bob. Bob has terrible OCD. Bob also has a terrible desire to own a brick patio. His OCD prevents him from trusting anyone else to make the plan for his patio, so he sets to work for hours drawing up the perfect plan, measuring it out down to the last brick. Finishing his plan, he finds that he will need exactly 99 bricks to build his patio. So he calls up Acme Bricks and says, \"I need exactly 99 bricks!\"\n\n\"Well, sir, we only sell bricks in palettes of 100. We don't sell them in any other amounts. Is that okay?\"\n\n\"Oh no, no no no. That won't do. I need 99 bricks. I'm not going to use that extra brick. What am I supposed to do with an extra brick? It has to be exactly 99 bricks.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, what if you break a brick while you're working? It will be good to have a spare.\"\n\n\"Believe me, lady, I won't break a brick. I'm careful. I need 99 bricks.\"\n\nAt this point the lady is becoming impatient and just wants to sell him the palette, so she says, \"I'll tell you what, sir. If you finish building your patio and you still have that brick left over you can send it back to us for a refund.\"\n\n\"Deal,\" says Bob! A week passes and the 100-brick palette arrives. Bob immediately sets to work laying each brick, meticulously measuring everything, gingerly handling each brick. Hours later, Bob has a beautiful new patio, but just as he said, he is left with one extra brick. Bob calls up Acme Bricks. \"Listen, I got one brick left and I was told I could get a refund!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir, but we don't offer refunds.\" After much back and forth, Bob eventually is forced to give up his hope of a refund. And so it came to be that he couldn't return the one brick. That one singular red brick.\n\nBob sits the brick on the kitchen counter and has a bite to eat. As he washes the dishes he finds that he can't take his eyes off the brick, and as a result he has accidentally been using a fork to wash his plate. Angered by this, he grabs the brick and runs into the living room, placing the brick on the coffee table. He goes back to washing dishes in peace. Later, he is sitting in the living room watching Wheel of Fortune, but he can't seem to guess any of the phrases because all he can think about is that stupid brick staring at him from the coffee table. He grabs it and takes it to the bathroom, putting it on the back of the toilet. Later that evening, he is trying to take a whizz, and he can't even AIM for the sight of the brick on the back of the toilet. This being the last straw, he grabs the brick, runs outside, screams at the heavens and he throws the brick straight up into the air!!\n\n**Carl the Conductor**\n\nThere was once a man named Carl. Carl always wanted to be a trolley conductor, so he went to trolley conductor school. There he studied hard and graduated at the top of his class. When he graduated he had trolley companies lining up for him to come conduct for them. Eventually he settles on the Red Trolley Company in New York City.\n\nYears pass without incident until one day Carl accidentally ran over and killed none other than Regis Philbin. Now, as everyone knows, Regis Philbin has some exceptionally fanatical fans, and as a result Carl was placed on death row for his crime. Carl was a model inmate, never causing trouble and even starting a knitting club with the other death row inmates. As a result of this, Eugene the executioner took a liking to Carl. This made it sad for Eugene when Carl's day to be electrocuted came. Eugene decided that he would offer Carl one favor, and it could be anything, before he took the chair. Carl thought about it, and he said, \"Eugene, there is one thing in this entire world that I can think of that I want right now, and it's a blueberry plucked from the depths of the Amazon rainforest. If I could have that, I can die a happy man.\"\n\nEugene dutifully climbed aboard a plane and flew to the Amazon and hiked into the heart of the Amazon rain forest where he found a beautiful glade filled with blueberries. He picked a few and returned to New York. He gave the berries to Carl, and Carl appreciatively ate them with a big smile on his face. With everything ready to go, Eugene tearfully pulled the lever and the chair zipped and zapped, but when it was finished Carl was miraculously unharmed! Given that there was no legal precedence for the situation, and given that technically Carl served out his sentence, Carl was released from prison a free man.\n\nIt took some convincing, but Carl managed to land a job at the Yellow Trolley Company in New Jersey, where he did a fantastic job conducting until one day he accidentally ran over and killed none other than Snooki. Now there aren't *many* fans of Snooki, but the ones that exist are the most rabid and vicious fans in the world, and so Carl found himself on death row again. \n\nEventually it came time to go to the electric chair again. A few days before the execution, he was approached by the executioner: Eugene. Eugene explained that he had been fired from his job in New York because the failure of the electric chair was blamed on him, but he had no hard feelings toward Carl. He took at as a sign that they would end up in the same place together again, and he offered Carl the same offer, and Carl had the same request. Returning from the Amazon with the blueberries, Eugene allowed Carl to eat them, and he flipped the switch again, unsure what to expect. Sure enough, Carl survived yet again, and found himself a free man.\n\nCarl found a job at the Green Trolley Company in California. Believe it or not, he accidentally ran yet another person over. This time it was none other than the Governator himself, Mr. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Needless to say, Carl found himself facing the chair again. A few days before his execution, he was approached by his old friend Eugene the executioner, who once again was fired and once again wound up in the same place. Eugene said, \"Carl, I know I'm going to regret this, but you want those berries again, don't you?\" Carl nodded, and Eugene, once again, made a trip to the Amazon.\n\nOn the day of the execution, Carl had his berries and Eugene flipped the switch. To everyone's surprise but Carl and Eugene, Carl was unharmed! Just as they were about to let Carl go, Eugene stopped him and said, \"Carl, listen, you owe me this. You gotta tell me how you are doing this!\" Carl stopped for a moment, thought about it, and said, \"Gee, Eugene. I don't know... I guess I'm just a terrible conductor.\"\n\n**Fred's Flight**\n\nThere's this guy named Fred. Fred has an interview to get to in Japan, and he's taking an overnight flight to get there. Fred decides he's going to try to sleep on the flight so he'll be well rested and ready for the interview first thing in the morning. He boards his flight and takes his seat next to this sweet little old lady. \"Ahh,\" he thinks, \"she certainly won't be a problem.\" The flight takes off and, Fred leans back, closing his eyes, drifting off to sleep...\n\n*YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP* Fred starts awake and looks around for the source of the sound. He notices that the old lady has carried a small dog onto the plane in her purse! \"Listen lady, I'm trying to get some sleep over here. I have a very important interview in the morning!\" The lady apologizes profusely and hushes the dog. Fred drifts back to sleep...\n\nFred is skipping nude through fields of daisy, dancing with the woodland creatures. A dog comes to join the dance. It looks at him. It opens its mouth. *YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP* Fred groans, waking up, and looks at the old lady sternly. \"I told you, I have to get my sleep! Shut the dog up or I'll shut him up!\" The lady hushes the dog, and Fred dozes back off...\n\nFred is at a French cafe on the waterfront, having a romantic dinner with his favorite supermodel. He leans in for a ki-- *YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP* Fred wakes up! He reaches over and grabs the little mutt and runs to the door of the plane. He opens the door and throws the dog out! Returning to his seat, he tells the crying old woman that he will buy her a new dog when they get to Japan. After a little bit, the man falls asleep again...\n\nHe's back in high school... he's in the cafeteria... everyone is shouting \"Look! Look!\" and he realizes he's completely naked! He wakes up and sees everyone gathered around a window shouting \"Look! Look!\" Fred pushes to the front and looks out the window, wondering what they could be seeing... he finally gets a glimpse: It's the brick!\n\n------------\n\nSee, didn't I tell you it would all pay off!? I love these jokes. Sorry for the wasted time! Now go use them to waste someone else's!",

This milk cow was quite amazing, because with all of the extra milk the cow produced the family was able to sell all of the excess and live quite well.\n\nOne day, the father of the family went outside to milk the cow. But something was wrong, it was dead. The father panicked realizing he had just lost his best source of income. With his poor coping skills, he decided to kill himself.\n\nThe mother of the house was worried that her husband was out in the bar for so long, so she decided to check in on him. As would be expected, she found him hanging from the rafters in the barn. Now, she really had something to be upset about, and she to killed herself.\n\nLater that day, the eldest son of the family came out to the barn, and found his mother and father dead. He was quite upset. But then he saw something, a leprechaun. Not just any leprechaun, a female leprechaun.\n\nThe leprechaun said to the son, \"Oh boy, it looks like your having a bad day!\"\n\n\"No shit...\" Said the son.\n\n\"What if I were to tell you I could help you... Ah, just listen. If you are able to make love to me 10 times in a row with out stopping, I will bring everyone back to life, even the milk cow. But If you can't, I'll kill you,\" Said the leprechaun.\n\nThe son stood there for a moment, and then he said \"Well, I was going to kill my self, so I guess I will give it a shot.\"\n\nHe didn't make it, after three times he fell asleep, and didn't wake up.\n\nThe middle son of the family came outside, and found his dead family, as well as the leprechaun.\n\nThe leprechaun, said to him, \"Ah, It looks like your having a bad day. I will tell you what, if you can make love to me ten times in a row, without stopping,  I will bring everyone back to life, even the milk cow, If you can't, I will kill you.\"\n\nThe middle son said, \"Sure, why not! I haven't been laid for quite a while.\" \n\nThe middle son made it about six times in a row, but was unable to continue.\n\nSoon enough, the youngest son came outside, and found that everyone in his family was dead. He also found the leprechaun.\n\nShe offered him the same as his brothers.\n\nAnd he said, \" But what if I can fuck you fifteen times in a row?\"\n\nThe leprechaun was shocked, she wasn't used to being asked questions. And then she said, \" I will bring all of your family back to life, as well as the milk cow, and where your tiny hovel is, will be a new mansion!\"\n\nThen the son said, \"What if I can fuck you... twenty times in a rows?\"\n\nThe leprechaun laughed at the ludicrous idea and said. \"Then I will throw in my pot of gold\"\n\nThe son said to her, \"But, what is going to keep you from dying after I fuck you twenty time in a row?\"\n\n\"Why do you ask me that\"\" Said the leprechaun.\n\nAnd then the son said, \"The milk cow did.\"",

The cardinal, also Irish, calls in Father Patrick - \"Faith, Paddy me lad! I understand that you don't like t'English, but you're a man of t' cloth, y'can't express yer hatred so tru'ly and openly.

When I got home, my b.f seemed excited to see me and exclaimed delightedly: \"Darling I have a surprise for dinner tonight.\" He then blindfolded me and led me to my chair at the dinner table. I took a seat and just as he was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. He made me promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned and went to answer the call. The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my b.f was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a garbage dump! I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable! Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence, when my b.f returned, apologizing for taking so long. He asked me if I had peaked through the blindfold, and I assured him I had not. At this point, he removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table, with their hands to their noses, chorused: \"Happy Birthday\"..",

Also at the top of the mountain, there was an ancient monastery where ancient monks lived.\n\nSometimes, the little boy, as he was riding his tricycle around his yard, would look up at the monastery on the tall mountain and wonder what it was like up there. \n\nOne day, when the wind was blowing down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold and the little boy could hear a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.\n\nSo, the little boy made a peanut butter sandwich, hopped on his tricycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours and hours, but he finally made it to the top. He bravely pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Monk, sir. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the head monk, \"I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\nSadly, the little boy got back on his tricycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.\n\nThe wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was a bit bigger and stronger now and now rode around town on his bicycle.\n\nAs luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.\n\nSo, the bigger boy made a ham and cheese sandwich, hopped on his bicycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.\n\n\"Hey, Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the head monk, \"I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\nSadly, the big boy got back on his bicycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.\n\nThe wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy had grown into a strapping youth now and rode around town on his motorcycle.\n\nAs luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.\n\nSo, the strapping youth grabbed a slice of pizza, hopped on his motorcycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 30 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.\n\n\"Yo, Mr. Monk, dude. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the head monk, \"I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\nSadly, the strapping youth got back on his motorcycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.\n\nThe wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was now a young man and often rode around in his new convertible sportscar.\n\nAs luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.\n\nSo, the young man bought a burger at a fast food place, got in his convertible sportscar, and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 20 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.\n\n\"Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the head monk, \"I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\nSadly, the young man got back in his convertible sportscar and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.\n\nThat night, he thought and thought about the very strange noise and how he just had to know what caused it. So, he resolved to do something about it the next day.\n\nThe next day, he got in his convertible sportscar and raced up the mountain, slammed on his brakes, and skidded to a stop right in front of the massive door to the monastery.\n\nHe honked the horn of his convertible sportscar until the head monk finally opened the door.\n\n\"Alright, Mr. Monk, I want to know what is making that very strange noise coming from you monastery!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the head monk, \"I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.\"\n\n\"Well, then can I become a monk?\"\n\n\"Why certainly! It is quite easy. You must travel the earth and count the number of blades of grass in every field and the number of grains of sand on every beach. When you return with your answer, then you shall be a monk.\"\n\nSo the young man left the monastery and travelled the earth. For years and years he counted the blades of grass and grains of sand, until one day he had finally finished. He made his way slowly back to the monastery and found the head monk.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Monk, I have travelled the earth these past years, counting the blades of grass and grains of sand. I finally know that there are 123,123,123,123,123 blades of grass in the fields and 123,123,123,123,123 grains of sand on the beaches and I would like to become a monk.\" \n\nSo the man became a monk. At last, he would now be able to find out the source of that very strange noise coming from the monastery.\n\n\"Mr. Monk, what is the noise coming from the monastery?\" asked the new monk.\n\nThe head monk replied, \"The source is too complicated to describe in words. I am afraid that you must see it for yourself to truly understand it. This key will show you the answer you seek.\"\n\n\"Take this key to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. There you will find a long corridor. At the end of the corridor is a door and through the door is the thing that makes the noise.\"\n\nWell, of course the new monk went immediately to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and there he did indeed find the long corridor. He walked down the corridor until he could see the door at the end. \n\nUnfortunately, there were three magical fires that never go out blocking the man from the door. He decided to jump the fires to reach the door. The man made sure the key was secure in his hand, took a running charge at the first fire and leapt!\n\nOver the first fire he flew, but he dropped the key. The man leapt back over the fire, ran all the way back down the long corridor, out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and back to the head monk.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the first one as I leapt over it.\"\n\n\"Do not worry, for there is another key and you must overcome tests on your way to enlightenment. The second key, however is far, far away in Canada.\"\n\nThe new monk left the monastery and travelled to Canada. It took many years because he had no money, being a monk and all.\n\nEventually, he arrived in Canada and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. \n\nThe three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.\n\nOver the first fire went the monk, key still in hand!\n\nOver the second fire went the monk, key still- RATS!\nHe had dropped the key in the second fire. The monk leapt back over the second fire, back over the first fire, back down the long corridor he walked and out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. The monk went back to the head monk.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the second one as I leapt over it.\"\n\n\"Do not worry, for there is one more key and we must all overcome tests on our way to enlightenment. The third key, however is far, far away in Australia.\"\n\nThe monk left the monastery and travelled to Australia. It took many years because he had no money being a monk and all.\n\nEventually he arrived in Australia and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. By this time, he was quite an old monk.\n\nDown into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.\n\nOver the first fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!\n\nOver the second fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand! \n\nOver the THIRD fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!\n\nHe had made it! He'd made the jumps and here he was standing outside the door with the answer to his question. Finally, finally, after so many, many, many years of wanting to know what was making the strange noise, he would know. The answer lay through the door in front of him and he could at last be at peace with himself.\n\nSlowly, the quite old monk slid the key into the lock. Turning the key a slight 'click' was to be heard as the lock moved back allowing the quite old monk to open the door. He pushed the door open and stepped inside. \n\nShock and amazement came over him as he finally realized the answer to his question!",

The little boy excitedly agreed and after about twenty seconds the teacher said, \"Is it candy!?\" - The little boy surprisingly and a little disappointed walked back to his desk.\n\nThe second student was Taylor and her dad owned a kitchen appliance store. She walked up to her teacher with a fancily wrapped box about the size of a Football. The teacher took the box and asked if she could try to guess what was in the box - Taylor excitedly agreed and handed the package over to her teacher. The teacher stood there thinking for about forty five seconds then said, \u201cIs it a Toaster!?\u201d \u2013 The little girl was surprised and asked the teacher how she knew. The teacher smiled wide, thanked the student, and Taylor returned to her desk.\n\nThe third student was Sarah and her dad owned a winery. She walked up to the teacher with a box that was a little bigger than the teacher was expecting. The teacher smiled and asked if she could guess what was in the box. Sarah happily agreed, and handed over the box to her teacher. At this point, the entire classroom wanted to know if the teacher was going to get it right. The teacher started thinking, - the box felt a little lopsided, but she figured the gift just hadn\u2019t been packaged well. After about a minute the teacher noticed little yellow drops coming from the side of the box. The teacher excitedly said, \u201cIs it wine!?\u201d and proceeded to taste some of the dripping liquid.

What's it matter to you?!

As they settle down for the night, the wife suddenly gasps and tells him \"It's time!\" so they hurry out to the car and race to the hospital. After hours that feel like days, she finally gives birth to a healthy baby boy, and as they both gaze lovingly on him they see he has all the right number of fingers and toes, shining bright eyes, and a cute little giggle. In short, a wonderful child. As time passes, they settle in to being new parents, watching him grow and eagerly awaiting his first steps and his first word like all parents do, and he continues to grow and be healthy and strong. One day, years later, the boy is being bathed and he is splashing and playing with his bath toys when a glint catches his eye. He looks down and sees it again as his mother moves her head out of the light, and so he tries to figure it out and finds deep in his belly button there is a little golden screw. He pokes at it, but it doesn't seem to hurt and feels pretty snug and soon he forgets about it as his ducky floats into view again. A few more years pass, he does well in school and is one of those kids that is popular but never lets it go to his head. He has friends, and everyone else just thinks of him as a good kid, even his teachers can tell he is special and destined to go far. One evening after finishing his chores and homework he heads up to shower before bed, and due to a particularly fuzzy new sweater, finds some lint in his belly button. As he goes to wash it out he finds the tiny golden screw again and this time since he is older he thinks to ask. As he is being tucked in he says \"Mom, do you know why I have a little golden screw deep in my belly button?\"  and she replies \"I saw that when you were born, and I asked the doctors and they examined you very carefully. They tested and x-rayed and prodded and found that it was not harmful at all and since they didn't know why it was there they left it alone. So, now that you have asked I can tell you that it is perfectly harmless and you should just try to ignore it.\" Since the boy loved his parents and knew they loved him he was satisfied and went to sleep. Many years later the boy graduated from high school and was accepted into a very prestigious college.  Wanting to do good for the world, and to make his parents proud and reward them for all they had done for him, he chose to study medicine so he might one day become a doctor. Also, though it never came up again, he had been slowly growing more and more curious about the little golden screw in his belly button. He had played sports, and even fooled around a bit with some girls, and though he never mentioned it he had always taken a second to check, if he could, and had never seen anyone else with anything unusual in their belly buttons. Part of what made him want to be a doctor was to see if there was an explanation for him. So he went on to college, and studied very hard, keeping his grades up near the top of class and all the while spending any extra time he had doing extra research on belly buttons and golden screws. He graduated and went on to a successful practice, specializing in gastroenterology and seeing many patients with stomach ailments and helping them greatly. His studies kept going and he discovered a new method for helping with heartburn and with his deeper understanding a new insight on defecation that revolutionized the toilet industry but nothing he saw, read, or discovered helped explain the little golden screw in his belly button. Eventually he grew frustrated and one day had an epiphany, medicine was never going to find the answer for him. He carefully settled his accounts, and went about closing his practice and letting people know that he was retiring from medicine. If they pressed, he would tell them he was feeling a calling and indeed those friends were not surprised to hear he had taken vows to follow the local religion the next week. Reasoning that medicine did not have an answer, he turned to religion and once again invested himself completely in his new life. Taking a vow of silence he moved to a far off monastery where he begin reading and learning from the hundreds of tomes they had there. His fellow monks were in awe at his voracious appetite for the truth, often marveling at how his faith must be strong to sustain him as he spent nearly every waking moment reading and praying over the collected knowledge of centuries of holy men. Eventually he came to end his vow of silence, and while tentative at first soon he was speaking and discussing what he had learned with all his fellow devotees. His insights and understanding were incredible, and many felt an almost miraculous joy when he would work out some new connection that clarified even more the tenets of their faith. Sadly, though he was rapidly becoming one the most devout and learned men of the church, in his heart he was growing more lost as he still sought an answer to the question of the golden screw and no tome had yet revealed it to him. Once again he felt that he had come to the end of a journey, and though he loved his fellow monks he could not in good faith stay as he was no longer true in his heart, he had to move on and seek elsewhere for his answer. Taking up his old things he left the monastery and went out into the world once again. With his medical knowledge and inner peace from his faith, he started to travel the globe helping others and doing good works. He would travel to far off lands, often finding the most remote and sometimes forgotten people and would take time to learn from them, their languages and cultures, helping them in whatever way he could and always seeking out the most knowledgeable among them to eventually ask one question. Do they know anything about the golden screw? For the next two decades he wandered, covering every inhabited place on earth, learning cultures and languages all over and becoming someone who could fit in anywhere. Eventually he was so known that he found himself traveling among the great and powerful in every region, spending time with presidents and kings, imams and warlords, people who took to him their most vexing problems and with his vast experience he was often able to help solve them. He was responsible for peace treaties, and social reforms, economic growth and the fostering of global understanding. He never charged for his services, nor did he ask for recognition, but invariably he would find a moment to ask these great leaders and their learned advisors the question, which still haunted him, did they know of the golden screw? He eventually came to realize that no one had the answer, though he had not asked every person on earth he had asked enough to realize that he was unique and alone in this and so he once again moved on from his quest and secluded himself from the world. He spent weeks in meditation, praying in silence, and fasting, taking mixtures he had learned of to help open his inner eye and expand his mind, seeking his answer through mysticism and hoping for a sign from beyond the earthly realms. As he slowly wasted away, his quest seemed to be ending not with an answer but with his profound sense of failure. By chance, a boy he had met as a child in school was unbeknownst to him assigned a new job as a mail carrier in the neighborhood where he was seeking his answers. After weeks of seeing the mail pile up he became concerned and so he knocked on the door of the house, and it swung open for him. As it did, he saw his old friend laying on the floor nearly gone and rushed to his aid. In his delirium the man though he was seeing an ethereal figure coming to him and he tried to ask 'What is the golden screw?\" and though the friend heard nothing more than a dry whisper he cradled his friend as he called for help \"Send a driver quickly!\" he yelled into the phone and the man heard him as \"Seek the screwdriver within!\". The ambulance arrived and the man was rushed to the hospital, and though he was very weak he was able to recover and one day found himself once again hale and healthy. Though he still had no answer, he now had a new quest, to find the screwdriver that would fit with his golden screw. He just knew that when he found it he would find his answers! Once again he went into the world, this time seeking out the wisest of wise men, whose deep understanding of the mystic world surely must give them insights like the one he had. Swamis, yogis, cultists and prophets, he sought them all out and no longer asked of the golden screw but of a screwdriver and slowly he began to get clues and intimations that such a thing might exist. One man in a smoke filled hut said that centuries ago such a thing had been worshiped but was lost to a holy war. On another continent a mystic in a trailer in the back of a traveling show confirmed that they had a tale of stealing the relic but it had been cursed and so they had left it behind to flee it's darkness. Crossing to the land of their origin he hunted down a local wise woman who many said was a witch, and she was able to relate how decades ago they had found the relic in a haunted wood, and it was thought to be a bad omen and so they sent it away to a holy man to have it cleansed. Finally he had a name! She knew of the place it was sent and the holy man was a yogi in a far off land! Once again he traveled, with a name to guide him, and slowly made his way from one village to the next until he found himself at a temple at the base of a towering mountain. Going inside he waited patiently, though his heart raced, and finally was brought to the leader of the temple where he asked his question. The leader looked at the man, and with sad eyes told him that yes they knew of the screwdriver and that they were indeed the ones it had been sent to to be cleansed. The leader looked t him and said\n \"I am not the head of this temple, I am but his assistant. For, you see, our leader took the relic and went to our most holy shrine to purify it. It is at the top of this mountain, in a small cave, with no path and many dangerous pitfalls before it. Only the most blessed and pure have ever made it there and that is where, if anywhere, it is. But! He left years ago and we have not heard from him since, we wait for his return or a sign of his passing but we have not seen him since he left with the screwdriver.\" The man realized now what he must do. He had done good works all his life, helped many others and lived a long life, and now he must take one last trek to either find his answer or pass away in the attempt. \"Good sir, please help me prepare myself for this pilgrimage. Anoint me, dress me, and say with me the words I must say to ready me. For tomorrow I begin my ascent to find the screwdriver, and if I can I will send you word of your most high leader.\" With that he began, and they shaved his head and washed him, gave him the robes and sandals of a penitent, and spoke with him the words that would aid him and protect him. He began his climb, and at first it was as simple as walking up a hill. It grew steeper, and he began to need to navigate around large rocks, or places where the soil was loose and so it became more challenging. Eventually it grew steep enough that he had to climb, and so he did using the many cracks and divots in the cliff face to move ever upward. Soon the cliff became more smooth, years of weather like the winds that tugged at him now had worn away the features. Now he often had to backtrack as he found himself climbing into spots where there was no where else to go, though each time when he did he could see another path to one side and so he would climb down and go that way. This went on for three days, his small bag of water ran out, and a small storm passed by allowing him to get more at the cost of nearly washing him away. His hands and feet became little more than claws, tools to help him climb. His years of focus on finding the screw aided him in making the climb, physical and mental exhaustion were ignored as he focused on his goal. Suddenly, he reached up and found a flat surface. His mind came back to him and he realized he was on the lip of a cave, he had made it! He worked his way up and onto the cave floor and passed out, his body finally demanding the rest he had denied it. He came to to the sound of humming, a regular melodious hum of a familiar chat. He opened his eyes and saw a small light, as he focused he realized it was a candle at the back of the cave and in the darkness he saw a wizened old man seated by it and that was the source of the humming. He sat up slowly and met the man's eyes, the man smiled and as he opened his mouth to ask the old man said, \"You have come for the screwdriver.\" He modded slowly, and the old yogi pointed to a spot next to the candle. He moved over and sat there across from him and said, \"Then it is real? You have it?\". The old man reached into a small bag, and slowly pulled out a tiny golden object, as he brought it into the light the man saw it was a perfectly crafted screwdriver with a head that was the absolute reverse of the head of the screw in his belly button. He reached out and took it from the man, who modded and smiled saying, \"In all the world, for all time, there has only been one man for whom this relic has meaning.\" The man stood up shakily, in awe he opened his robes and gently felt his belly button for the screw. Then with trembling hands he guided the screw driver towards it, feeling an almost euphoric thrill as the driver fit perfectly, a tingling running through his body at the touch. Slowly, gently, he began to turn the screwdriver, and though it had never moved before the screw spun smoothly and silently as he did. One, two, three full turns he took.\n\nAnd his butt fell off.",

Every day, he went to the beach in hopes of meeting someone special, but every day he was disappointed because all the girls seemed to hang around one certain man. This guy was not necessarily much to look at, but he seemed to be a real chick magnet and Sam was baffled. \n\nTwo days before his vacation ended, Sam happened to see this man in his hotel lobby, and got up the courage to approach him.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" Sam stammered, \"but I could not help but notice that you are quite the ladies' man on the beach. I wouldn't try to compete with you, but tomorrow is my last day of vacation and I was wondering if you might share your secret with me before I go.\"\n\n\"Well sure!\" the man said heartily, \"since you're only here one more day, I can do that.Here's what you do: buy yourself a really tight pair of Speedos, and a good-sized baking potato. Slip the potato down your Speedos and strut your stuff. The ladies will knock themselves out to be near you. Good luck!\"\n\nSam wasn't sure this would work, but he had nothing to lose so he did as instructed. Next morning he heads for the beach, and just as he suspected, the potato-in-the-Speedo was not having the effect he wanted. In fact, people were starting to point and laugh and Sam was beginning to wonder if maybe he had gotten a potato that was too large.\n\nSuddenly Sam sees the guy who gave him the advice, and motions him to come over. \"Why isn't this working?\" Sam asks. \"I did what you told me to do! Is my potato too large?\"\n\n\"No, the size is fine,\" the guy says, \"but you need to put it in the FRONT!\"",

He is only now noticing that Wife 1.0 also is spawning Child-Processes which are further consuming valuable resources. \nNo mention of this particular phenomenon was included in the product brochure or the documentation, though other users have informed him that this is to be expected, due to the nature of the application.\n\nNot only that, Wife 1.0 installs itself such that it is always launched at system initialization where it can monitor all other system activity.\nHe's finding that some applications such as PokerNight 10.3, BeerBash 2.5, and PubNight 7.0 are no longer able to run, crashing the system when selected (even though they always worked fine before). At installation, Wife 1.0 automatically installs undesired Plug-Ins such as MotherInLaw 55.8 and BrotherInLaw Beta release. As a consequence system performance seems to diminish with each passing day.\n\nSome features he'd like to see in the upcoming Wife 2.0:\n\nA \"Don't remind me again\" button;\nA Minimize button;\nAn install shield feature that allows Wife 2.0 to be installed with the option to uninstall at anytime without the loss of cache and other system resources;\nAn option to run the network driver in promiscuous mode which would allow the systems hardware probe feature to have greater use.\nAnother friend decided to avoid all the headaches associated with Wife 1.0 by sticking with Girlfriend 2.0. Even here, however, I found many problems.\nApparently you cannot install Girlfriend 2.0 on top of Girlfriend 1.0. You must uninstall Girlfriend 1.0 first. Other users say this is a long standing bug which everyone should have been aware. Apparently the versions of Girlfriend have conflicts over shared use of the I/O port. You'd think they would have fixed such a stupid bug by now.\nTo make matters worse, the uninstall program for Girlfriend 1.0 doesn't work very well leaving undesirable traces of the application in the system.\nAnother annoying problem -- all versions of Girlfriend continually pop-up annoying messages about the advantages of upgrading to Wife 1.0\n\n\n***** BUG WARNING *****\n\nWife 1.0 has an undocumented bug. If you try to install Mistress 1.1 before uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney files before executing a self - uninstallation. Then Mistress 1.1 will refuse to install, claiming insufficient system resources.\n\n\n***** BUG WORK-AROUNDS *****\n\nTo avoid the above bug, try installing Mistress 1.1 on a different system and never run any file transfer applications such as Laplink 6.0. Also, beware of similar share-ware applications that have been known to carry viruses that may affect Wife 1.0.\n\nAnother solution would be to run Mistress 1.0 via a UseNet provider under an anonymous name. Here again, beware of the viruses which can accidentally be downloaded from the UseNet.\n\n\n(From www.freebyte.com)",

Finally, upstairs there is a 90 year old woman who has never had an orgasm; you have to fix that.\"\n\n\"Damn, that sounds a bit extreme for my taste, I think I'll just have a beer\" the man says.

Finally, he shrugs, pulls out a twenty, and puts it in the jar. At this, the entire bar cheers.\n\nThe bartender announces \"Challenge one!\" and pours the man eight shots. Without a moment's hesitation, the man pounds all of them back, with time to spare. The bar cheers again as the man announces, heavily inebriated and slurring his words, \"Alright, I've done the shots, now for challenge two!\" and stumbled out the back door, shutting it behind him.\n\nThe bar patrons can hear what happens next. Barking, yipping, the man yelping, the tearing of clothes; there is a true battle raging outside. Finally, it gets quiet and the man comes back in. His shirt is torn to shreds, he's bleeding from a dozen cuts and bits, but he stands triumphant with a huge, drunken smile on his face.\n\n\"Took care of the dog!

This king liked nothing more in the world than purple - not indigo nor violet, not crimson nor deep magnolia, but dark mysterious malevolent purple. Such was the Purple King's love for purple that he decreed all in his kingdom should be purple. He sat upon a purple throne, wearing his purple crown, embellished with purple amethysts. He was attended by beautiful purple maids, and his castle was entirely decorated ina stylish purple decor. Everything was purple.\n\nOne day the Purple King decided he wanted to venture out into his purple kingdom, and so he summoned his purple knights into his purple throne room where he was seated on his purple throne dressed in all his royal purple finery. He said to the knights, \"Men! I wish to survey my purple kingdom!\"\nAnd so they all donned their purple armour, mounted their purple horses and escorted the purple king through the purple castle, out the purple gates and across the purple drawbridge. They travelled down the purple road through the purple forest all the way to the purple town. The entourage meandered through the purple streets, the king admiring the purple houses inhabited by the purple people, going about their daily chores, when all of a sudden, amongst the daily bustle of the purple town the king spied something he absolutely could not abide. \n\nA man.\nDressed.\nIn blue.\n\nYou have to understand this was a treasonous offence in the purple kingdom. The king cried to his purple knights and they seized the man, slinging him across the back of a purple horse and galloping back trough the purple town. They cantered up the purple road, back trough the purple forest, across the purple drawbridge and into the purple castle. They dragged the man down the purple stairs into the purple dungeon and down to the darkest, dankest, deepest purple cell.\nThe king opened the purple door of the purple cell and said to the man...\n\n\n\"Indigo\"",

One day, Mr. Cheerio decided to pray to the Cheerio God. \n\n\"Dear Cheerio God. I am your humble Cheerio servant. I kindly ask that you grant me relief from my situation.\"\n\nMr. Cheerio goes to bed on a bench, and when he wakes up, he is amazed to find that he's now living inside a small apartment. His home isn't too big, and there's not much to look at, but it's a million times better than where he was before. Feeling dignified, Mr. Cheerio ventures out to get a job at Cheerio-Mart. It's minimum wage, and he hates stocking shelves, but it'll suffice. Mr. Cheerio also sets up an account on E-Cheerio, and meets a wonderful Chocolate Cheerio, who is destined to be his girlfriend. Satisfied, Mr. Cheerio stays happy for a few months. One day, Mr. Cheerio gets tired of where he's at, so he prays to the Cheerio God once again. \n\n\"O great Cheerio God. Thank you for your kindness. I am asking you humbly for more. Please grant me a nicer home and life.\"\n\nTo his pleasant surprise, Mr. Cheerio once again wakes up in a better situation. Now, he has a decently sized home. He lives in a house now, and he's got a TV and Cheerio-Station. His home isn't huge, but it's got a lot more than the bare necessities.  Mr. Cheerio felt awesome. He decides to go out, quit his job, and apply for an engineering job instead. He gets it, and he's now getting a solid $60k a year. Mr. Cheerio decided that day to propose to his girlfriend. She accepts, and Mr. Cheerio has a Cheerio wedding in the same year. Mr. Cheerio is now feeling wonderful, and time passes like this for a few years. One day, Mr. Cheerio gets tired of his living, again. He prays to the Cheerio God.\n\n\"Awe-inspiring God of Cheerios. You have granted me so much already. Please, I ask only once more, make my situation better\". \n\nAnd so he did. The next morning, Mr. Cheerio wakes up in the largest mansion you could imagine. He owns every Cheerio-car on the market, has a Cheerio-Pool and Cheerio Alley in his basement, an elevator so he can see the Cheerio City from his roof, and best of all, the most comfortable Cheerio Bed. Amazed, Mr. Cheerio goes to apply for a new job. Without any effort at all, he is immediately hired as a Cheerio Lawyer. Mr. Cheerio now makes $250k a year, and he is super happy with his job. He also won the Cheerio Lottery three times, making him and his wife millionaires. His wife give birth to three wonderful Cheerio Children, and Mr. Cheerio now has a family whom he loves. Mr. Cheerio is world-famous for donating so many Cheerio dollars to charities, and being involved in projects around the world. Amazed with his success, Mr. Cheerio decides to celebrate by taking his family to the local Cheerio Fest.   \n\nWhen he arrives, the fest is very crowded, so he finds a picnic bench, and saves some spots for his family. After eating their packed lunches, Mr. Cheerio gets up to buy some beverages for his family. Scouting around through the crowd, Mr. Cheerio eventually spots a lemonade line. He would like to get some for his family, but the line is way too long, and Mr. Cheerio doesn't have the patience. A bit further away, he spots a beer line. The line is shorter, but his kids are underage, and he doesn't want to have to get in line twice for his kids. A little longer, and he spots a milk line. But his wife is lactose intolerant, so he moves on. Mr. Cheerio eventually spots the perfect place to head to, and gets in the punch line, but there wasn't one. \n\nEdit: Spelling",

What's the second task?\"\n\nThe bartender sighs, \"Well that part is a bit of a heartbreaker.  The owner, man that he was, has a prize fighting dog.  Beautiful animal.  Vicious like the devil himself.  In his glory days the owner had a few of the dog's teeth capped in gold to make him even more impressive.  But those days are gone and the dog is dying of rabies in the basement of this very bar.  The animal is quite mad and extremely violent.  The second task is to pull out one of the dog's gold teeth.\"\n\nThe man looks pale now, \"Sweet Jesus.  What's the third task?\"\n\nThe bartender points back out the entrance to the bar, \"You might not have noticed, but there's a convent across the street.  Been here a long time.  And in that convent lives Sister Mary Agatha and she's 100 years old now.  Still a virgin.  The third task, young man, is to seduce that ancient crone and get her to have three orgasms.\"\n\nThe man doesn't even answer.  He just stares out the door as his shoulders slump down in defeat.  Eventually he takes a seat beside the jar of money and just sits there, pondering it, for a long time.  But after a while he straightens up, squares his shoulders, and calls over the bartender.\n\n\"I'm going to do it.  I'm going to do the challenge.  Pour me a shot.\"  He says.\n\nThe bartender smiles a knowing grin as he grabs a bottle and starts pouring a shot, \"If that's the case then your drinks are on the house, young man.\"\n\n\"In that case, good sir, let's make it five shots.  In fact, let's make them doubles!\"  The man says.\n\nThe bartender nods and pours out five brimming double shots, all in a line, for the man.\n\nThe man takes the first, looks over at that terrifying gorilla lurking in the shadows, and raises his glass before downing it.\n\nHe takes the second, glances down towards the basement below his feet, raises his glass, and then downs it.\n\nHe takes the third, raises it to the convent across the street, and then downs it.\n\nThe fourth he raises to the bartender, who nods in acknowledgment, and then he downs it.\n\nThe last he raises to himself, for courage, and then downs it.\n\nThen he sits there for a long moment, contemplating his destiny, silent for so long that the bartender nearly says something, but before he can the man leaps off his stool, shakes off the impending buzz, and then breaks into a sprint, straight across directly towards the bouncer.  As he runs he reaches back, way back, all the way to his midwestern roots, and when he swings at that Yeti's jaw it's with all the force in his being.  The bouncer goes down like a felled tree in the forest.\n\nThe man doesn't skip a beat as he turns on his heel and sprints back across the room, past the stunned faces of the other patrons, past the shocked face of the friendly bartender, to the far side of the bar, where he yanks open the door to the basement and sprints down into those nightmare depths.\n\nIt's silent for a moment as everyone in the bar looks at each other in complete surprise and wonder, but they collectively turn and stare at the basement doorway as they hear a deep noise coming up from below, like the vibration of some distant train, that grows steadily louder and louder, until they recognize the terrifying growl of a creature so utterly insane, filled with such terrifying rage and hate, that they can scarce believe it's made by any living thing.\n\nAnd then that growl explodes into a violent torrent of barking and snarling and sounds of struggle.  Yelping and gasping and snapping sounds emanate from that yawning doorway.  And then, unexpectedly, there is a moment of silence.\n\nSuddenly the hair on the back of the neck of everyone in the bar stands on end as a deep animal howl breaks the silence.  Long.  Drawn out.  Filled with sadness and longing.\n\nSilence again.  And then a second howl.  Even more desperately filled with anguish than the first.\n\nSilence.  Then a third howl.  Filled with the most unbearably heartbreaking misery.\n\nSilence.  And then the slow clump of feet on the stairs.  Each step slower than the last.  Exhaustion apparent in each.\n\nAnd then the man appeared.  Scuffed, scraped, clothes torn and ripped and ragged, covered in countless bloody scratches and bites.  He bore a haunted look like he had seen things no man should see.\n\nHe stumbled over and fell into a seat at the bar, \"That was, without a doubt, the most difficult thing I have ever done in my entire life.\"\n\n\"\u2026pulling out that nuns gold tooth is going to be a cakewalk by comparison.\"",

Here is a tale to tell:\n\nA couple years after the round table was established the King went on another campaign.  But there is a problem: he has a beautiful wife and he can't afford to leave her undefended in the castle right?  Arthur chose from his personal army, 12 of his strongest, best looking and most trusted knights to stay behind and defend his castle and his wife.\n\nNow here comes the tricky part.  In the middle ages there was no such thing as surveillance camera and there is no way to prevent his wife from cheating.  In order to keep his wife untouched the king also ordered a custom made chastity belt.  It is no ordinary chastity belt, it is a trapped chastity belt!\n\nYou see, ordinary chastity belt is made to prevent entry, but the queen's chastity belt was equipped with a guillotine.  It permits entry, and then it'll chop off whatever that tries to get out.  The king locks the belt, and went on his crusade.\n\nMonths after months of fighting, freeing slaves and doing justice, the king finally returns home, to see his beautiful wife.  That night when the king unlocked the belt, he found that the guillotine was used quite a few times.\n\nFurious, the king stormed out into the grounds, demanded the 12 knights to confess whom remained silent.  Furious, he ordered the knights to take off their leggings RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW.  All the knights took off their pants.  All but one of their knights have had their manhood chopped off.  The king ordered all 11 injured knights to the gallows. He promised the cheating knights a slow and painful death and the last of his faithful, royal knight an appropriate reward.\n\n\"Speak knight\" said King Arthur. \"How should I reward thee for thy faithful service?  I can give thee mountains of gold, a hundred virgin girls, or half the land of my kingdom.  Speak! And receive thy reward!\"\n\nThe knight kept his mouth shut tight.  He shook his head, and walked away, refusing the handsome reward the king promised, in tears.\n\nAnd hence began the tale of the silent knight, who never opened his mouth in public, especially in front of the king.",

It's a, er, police appreciation day and they're handing out free tangerines.\"\n\n\"Oh, move over dear, I'd like one too.\"\n\nA couple tense minutes pass, the girl's pulse quickening and her grandmother introducing herself to the other prostitutes on line.\n\nSo the cop reaches the girl, asks her name, makes a few notes, but then turns to the grandmother, and says, quizzically,\n\n\"Ma'am, I . . . I don't understand how you . . . ?\"\n\nAnd the grandmother smiles and says,\n\n\"Oh, at my age I just take my teeth out and suck 'em dry.\"",

He sees one young Taliban dash into the square and throw a Molotov cocktail twenty-five yards into a little second story window and ignite a house.  The same guy then pitches a grenade seventy-five yards and lands it into a narrow little chimney, blowing up the whole building.  \n\n\"There\u2019s my new quarterback!\" exclaims the coach.  \"We\u2019ve got to go find this kid.\"\n\nSo they send some people over to Afghanistan and they\u2019re able to scare up the young Taliban recruit, working from a bit of news footage.  They bring him over, teach him the game, fit him into his uniform, and their season really starts to turn around.  In fact, they\u2019re able to make it to the Super Bowl.

He had a dull job in the dull offices of a dull company that produced dull products for dull people.\n\nBut Kevin had a secret passion, a hobby to which he was so dedicated that it burned inside him like a hidden fire. I'm going to guess that you assumed this would be some sick, secret fetish, but this is a family joke.\n\nYou see, Kevin's hidden passion was tractors. He loved tractors. Loved them. He wore tractor socks to work. At work he worked on his computer, which had tractors for a wallpaper. He kept his schedule on a tractor calendar. While he went home, he played tractor-related games on his iPhone, which he kept in a tractor-shaped protector. When he went to bed, he slept under tractor sheets on a tractor pillow while dreaming dreams about tractors. He was pro-tractor. That was his angle.\n\nThe highlight of boring Kevin the tractor fanatic's boring months was the arrival in his mailbox of his favourite journal, Tractor Monthly. While Kevin had subscriptions to all the best tractor-focused periodicals, Tractor Monthly was the best- the New Yorker of tractor journalism.\n\nOne day, when Kevin arrived home from work, he found that his next issue of Tractor Monthly had arrived. He made himself a cup of tea, and sat down, opening up the glossy cover to savour this new month's reading. On the first page, there was an advert that made boring little Kevin's boring little heart go all a-flutter!\n\nThe world tractor convention was coming. To his town. This year. He had always, always cherished the dream of going to WoTracCon, but he'd never been able to afford the airfares to the glamorous locales in which it was usually held.\n\nAs he read on, excitement mounting, the news just got better. Tractor Monthly, that beacon of publishing excellence, was sponsoring a competition. The writer of the best essay on the topic \"Why Tractors Are Brilliant\" would receive not only a free VIP ticket to the convention, but would be allowed in early to be given a tour of the convention by no less a being than the President of the World Tractor Federation!\n\nKevin knew that this was his life's calling. He HAD to win. He called up work, and quit his dull job with the dull company to focus all his efforts on crafting his entry. He spent a solid month, working ten or more hours a day. Researching. Brainstorming. Drafting. Re-drafting. Proof reading. Until he had it. The perfect entry.\n\nOf course, he won. Such dedication must be rewarded. And so the tickets and a letter of congratulation arrived. And Kevin waited for the day, six months in the future where he would receive his reward.\n\nIt was a long wait for Kevin, but finally, the day came. The ticket said to be at the entrance of the convention centre at eight o'clock. Kevin was there at six, too excited to remain home any longer. \n\nAt eight, the door opened, and the President himself came out. He introduced himself, shook boring little Kevin by his boring little hand and lead him inside, into the convention hall. Kevin's head was spinning- he had never seen so many tractors at once. Red. Blue. Green. White. Big. Small. Any tractor your heart could desire- and Kevin's heart could desire quite a few tractors.\n\nThe President's secretary interrupted, saying that he had a very urgent phone call. The President apologised to Kevin and said that he should feel free to look around- but please not to touch anything, as the displays were still being finished and were a bit rickety, then disappeared to take his call.\n\nKevin wandered between the stands, the temptation building inside him as he gazed upon these magnificent machines. He tried his very best to keep his hands to himself.\n\nBut then he saw it. The PloughMonster 2800. The tractor, in boring little Kevin's boring little mind, to end all tractors. He couldn't help himself.\n\nHe ran to it.\n\nHe embraced it.\n\nIt fell to the floor.\n\nThere was crashing and screaming. Every tractor, like some sick, horrific display of dominoes, collapsed. Millions of dollars worth of machinery, destroyed in the fire of Kevin's passion.\n\nThe President stormed in, and stared around, aghast. He became furious. He walked over to Kevin and asked for his WTS membership card. With trembling hands, Kevin gave it to him. The President tore it up and threw the shreds to the ground, then spat upon them. Security came, and Kevin was tossed out into the pouring rain.\n\nDevastated, Kevin wandered the streets. More miserable than any man had ever been. But then a change came over him. He made a decision. If tractors didn't want Kevin, then Kevin would no longer want tractors! He would find a new, more worthy object of his devotion.\n\nKevin decided that the only way to celebrate such a momentous decision was with a drink. \n\nAt 8:30am, the only bar he could find open was a total dive, a genuine hell-hole. But nevertheless, into the dim, grimy, smoke-filled bar he went. When I say smoke filled, I mean filled. He could barely breathe. Kevin's eyes stung. But he went up to the bar. \n\nThe barman asked him what he wanted, but as Kevin opened his mouth to reply, something strange happened. The smoke began to pour into Kevin's mouth and lungs. Faster and faster he seemed to suck the smoke down, until he had hoovered up every breath of it in this squalid tavern.\n\nAppalled and confused, the barman looked at him and asked, voice trembling \"what the hell are you?!\"\n\nKevin smiled, sadly, and said \"Me? I'm an ex tractor fan.\"\n\nTl;dr: Probably best not to read it, really.\n\n",

Dogs needed to be walked constantly. Cats are loners. Ferrets smell. Fish are boring. Snakes are, well, snakes. After roaming around for about an hour, he hears someone pssst. He turns but doesn't see anyone except a parrot with a sign that reads, \"Intelligent Parrot with no legs. $2500.00\". \n\nThe man walks over and asks, \u201cDid you just call me?\u201d \n\n\u201cYes\u201d. Says the parrot. \u201cI see you walking around looking for a pet but it seems none meet your standards\u201d. The parrot spoke eloquently. \u201cMay I recommend you purchase me?\u201d \n\nThe man looks at the parrot and after a few moments of contemplation states. \u201cI have some questions. Number one, it reads you are an intelligent parrot. How intelligent? Number two, would your intelligence justify the $2500.00 cost?\u201d\n\nThe parrot seems to puff up and replies, \u201cI am very intelligent. I have studied Philosophy, Psychology and Finance. I would be a great addition to your household and help you in many ways. In regards to the price, it appears that people are very short sighted and only notice I have no legs. With this being said, I have no doubt that the owners of this establishment would let me go for a song; no pun intended. Make an offer and I have no doubt they will accept.\u201d \n\nThe man nods and asks, \u201cYeah, about that. How is that you are perched on that stick?\u201d \n\nThe parrot sighs and answers, \u201cI use my penis. I wrap it around the perch and tighten. Now please, for both our sakes, speak with the owners.\u201d The man agrees. \n\nAfter some negotiations, the man takes the parrot home. In no time, they become the best of friends. The parrot helps the man with his problems both mental and financial. The man\u2019s wealth grows and all the while his friendship with the parrot grows as well. After a year of probably the best decision the man had ever made, he comes home one night from work and the parrot tells him they need to speak. \n\n\u201cIt is very serious.\u201d Said the parrot. \n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d The man, very worried, sits before the parrot as he had never seen the parrot so melancholy. \n\n\u201cIt is about your wife.\u201d Says the parrot.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d The man asks, his brow furrowed. \n\n\u201cThis morning, after you left for work, the mailman knocked on the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what happened?\u201d The man asks timidly.\n\n\u201cYour wife answered the door in a negligee.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what happened?\u201d The man asks again, hesitantly. \n\n\u201cThe mailman came in and they began to kiss passionately.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what happened?\u201d The man asks again, his voice cracking.\n\n\u201cYour wife got on her knees and began to perform oral sex on the mailman.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my God. Then what happened?\u201d He asked with tears streaming down his face.\n\n\u201cThen the mailman got on his knees and began to give her oral sex.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cant believe this. Then what happened?\u201d He asked almost mechanically through clench teeth. \n\n\u201cThen the mailman stood up, tore her negligee off and threw her on the couch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can barely stand any more.

You were here. You were watching them.\u201d The man flung the chair across the room.

Now, curiosity has always been wont to get the better of me, and today was no different. With a little bit of discrete eavesdropping, I manage to pick up that they're discussing something called a \"purple people eater.\" In an admittedly rash decision, I ask them, \"Hey guys, what's a purple people eater?\" They stiffen up, give me a weird look, and call the teacher over, saying, \"Teacher, TheYear20XX is asking about purple people eaters!\"\n\nVisibly confused and distressed, the teacher asks me if I have anything to say for myself. I say, \"Well, I was sitting in class when I heard some guys talking about a purple people eater. I didn't know what it was, so I asked them what a purple people eater was. They called you over. So, teacher, what's a purple people eater?\" The teacher becomes seemingly enraged, but as she is currently teaching a class, she restrains herself and very intensely tells me to go to the principal's office. Not wanting to enrage her further, I head down there.\n\nWhen I get to the office, the receptionist gives me a smile asks what she can do for me. I say, \"Well, I was sitting in class when I heard some guys talking about a purple people eater. I didn't know what it was, so I asked them what a purple people eater was. They called the teacher over, so I asked her what a purple people eater was. She told me to go to the principal's office, and here I am. So, receptionist, what's a purple people eater?\" The receptionist gives me a look of sheer disgust, goes straight to the principal's office, comes back, and waves me in without a word.\n\nWhen I enter the office, the principal asks me what trouble I've gotten into now. I say, \"Well, I was sitting in class when I heard some guys talking about a purple people eater. I didn't know what it was, so I asked them what a purple people eater was. They called the teacher over, so I asked her what a purple people eater was. She told me to go to the principal's office, so I went there and asked the receptionist what a purple people eater was. She sent me here, and here I am. So, principal, what's a purple people eater?\" The principal doesn't respond and instead stares into the distance. In a voice trembling with fear, she says, \"Son, I'm sorry, but this is for your own good.\" She then writes me a month's suspension and tells me to go home.\n\nWhen I get home, my mom is very confused as to why I'm not at school. She asks me if I'm sick and if everything is all right. I say, \"Well, I was sitting in class when I heard some guys talking about a purple people eater. I didn't know what it was, so I asked them what a purple people eater was. They called the teacher over, so I asked her what a purple people eater was. She told me to go to the principal's office, so I went there and asked the receptionist what a purple people eater was. She sent me to the principal's office, so I asked the principal what a purple people eater was. She wrote me a month's suspension and sent me home, and here I am. So, mom, what's a purple people eater?\" My mother immediately bursts into tears. After spending a good 5 minutes calming her down and getting her into a state where she's able to speak, she sends me to my room and tells me to wait until my father gets home. Not wanting to upset her any further, I immediately go to my room and wait.\n\nWhen my father gets home, he comes up to my room and asks why my mother is crying. I say, \"Well, I was sitting in class when I heard some guys talking about a purple people eater. I didn't know what it was, so I asked them what a purple people eater was. They called the teacher over, so I asked her what a purple people eater was. She told me to go to the principal's office, so I went there and asked the receptionist what a purple people eater was. She sent me to the principal's office, so I asked the principal what a purple people eater was. She wrote me a month's suspension and sent me home, so I asked mom what a purple people eater was. She started crying and sent me to my room, and here I am. So, dad, what's a purple people eater?\" My father, normally a reasonable man, suddenly strikes me across the face. My cheek still stinging, he says that I am no longer any son of his and tells me to pack my bags and get out of his house.\n\nWithout many other options, I throw some clothes in a suitcase, gather some money, and walk out the door. I hail a taxi and instruct the driver to drive me to my grandmother's house. Along the way, the driver notices I'm extremely quiet and asks if I'm OK. I say, \"Well, I was sitting in class when I heard some guys talking about a purple people eater. I didn't know what it was, so I asked them what a purple people eater was. They called the teacher over, so I asked her what a purple people eater was. She told me to go to the principal's office, so I went there and asked the receptionist what a purple people eater was. She sent me to the principal's office, so I asked the principal what a purple people eater was. She wrote me a month's suspension and sent me home, so I asked my mom what a purple people eater was. She started crying and sent me to my room, so when my father came to talk to me, I asked him what a purple people eater was. He disowned me and kicked me out of the house, and here I am. So, taxi driver, what's a purple people eater?\" And the taxi driver simply pulls a hidden gun out from under his seat and shoots me in the face.\n\nI wake up surrounded by clouds and with a man in front of me. The man says, \"I am St. Peter, and these are the Pearly Gates. Tell me son, what events led to your death?\" I say, \"Well, I was sitting in class when I heard some guys talking about a purple people eater. I didn't know what it was, so I asked them what a purple people eater was. They called the teacher over, so I asked her what a purple people eater was. She told me to go to the principal's office, so I went there and asked the receptionist what a purple people eater was.

So, St. Peter, what's a purple people eater?\" And without a word, St. Peter opens up his book and crosses my name right out.\n\nI wake up surrounded by fire, the smell of sulfur pervading the area, and a man standing in front of me. The man says, \"I am Satan. Welcome to Hell, young man. Tell me, what unfortunate series of events landed you in this Godforsaken place?\" I say, \"Well, I was sitting in class when I heard some guys talking about a purple people eater. I didn't know what it was, so I asked them what a purple people eater was. They called the teacher over, so I asked her what a purple people eater was.

So, Satan, what's a purple people eater?\" And Satan says, \"Son, that's just a really long and rambling wall of text with no punch line designed to waste time and piss off a bunch of people on reddit.\"",

My mouth is dry is a hell. Imma run down to the pond and get a drink.\"\n\nThe lizard climbs down the tree, scurries over to the pond and starts drinking as fast as he can. While he's drinking, a crocodile pops his head up out of the pond. He sees the lizard gulping down water and asks, \"Whoa, man. Why you drinking that water so fast?\" \"Well,\" the lizard explains, \"I was up in that tree smoking a joint with my monkey friend and it gave me some killer cotton-mouth.\"\n\nThe croc thinks for a second and says, \"So, this monkey, is he cool? You think he'd let me smoke too?\" \"Oh yeah, sure!\" says the lizard, \"He's a real cool guy. I'm sure he wouldn't care.\"\n\nSo, the crocodile climbs up the tree and says to the monkey, \"Hey, pass that shit my way.\" The stoned monkey stares at him for several seconds before saying, \"Jesus man, how much water did you drink?!\"\n\n**Pot-Smoking Monkey Joke #2:**\n\nSo, our monkey friend is back in his tree, at it again. This time he's smoking a blunt by himself, when suddenly a rabbit jumps up the tree and kicks the blunt out his mouth.\n\n\"What are you doing?!\" the rabbit shouts happily, \"Look at yourself! You are a monkey is the jungles of Africa! You are as free as it gets! You don't need *marijuana* to feel good! Come run through the jungle with me and experience life to it's fullest!\"\n\nThe monkey nods his head agreeing, \"Yeah, let's do this!\"\n\nNow the rabbit and monkey are running together through the jungle when they come across a giraffe getting drunk on whiskey. The rabbit jumps up really high and knocks the bottle out of the giraffe's mouth.\n\n\"You don't need alcohol, giraffe!\" the rabbit exclaims, \"You're a wild animal in the jungle! This is as good as life gets! Forget that stuff and join me and my monkey friend running through the jungle, experiencing life!\"\n\n\"Yeah!' the giraffe says, \"I don't need this! Let's do it!\"\n\nNow the three of them are running freely when the come across a lion who is about to shoot up some heroin. The rabbit karate-kicks the needle out of the lion's paw and says, \"Hey, lion! Look at yourself! You dont...\"\n\n*SLAM!*\n\nIn one swift movement, the lion brings down his claws and smashes the rabbit to death.\n\nAfter a second of stunned silence, the monkey asks, \"What the fuck was that about?!\"\n\nThe lion says, \"I'm just fucking sick of it! Every time that rabbit gets a little coked up, suddenly he's all 'Oh you don't need that! Come run through the jungle with me!'\"",

We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big unnamed department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said, 'Lets get a pair for each outfit.' \n\nWe went on to the jewelry department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings. Let me tell you... she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. \n\nI think I threw her for a loop when I said, 'That's fine, honey.' She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation, she finally said, 'I think this is all dear, let's go to the cashier.' \n\nI could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, 'No honey, I don't feel like it.'\n\nHer face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, 'WHAT?' \n\nI then said, 'Honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You're just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.' \n\nAnd just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, 'Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?' \n\nApparently I'm not having sex tonight.",

So he has a month to renovate, and he gets a big aviary, a big lion cage, and an aquarium. He uses all of his money on that stuff. It's a week before opening day.\n\nHe realizes that he has no animals. So he goes on his laptop and finds out that the state of Florida has foster lions. He calls the state and arranges a time for them to bring the lions over. They come over, they're loading the lions into the cage, and they lions are just sitting there sleeping. The guy says \"Why are they tired?\" The state-workers say \"Well, these are foster lions. These guys used to be the guards of Mexican drug cartel bosses. The cartel fed them cocaine and now they're just tired.\" The guy goes \"Oh, alright.\" The state-worker says \"Right, so these are not your animals. They are the states'. You are getting $10,000 if you care for them.\"\n\nNow the guy needs birds. He's looking on Craigslist and he sees an ad for myna birds. Some guy has one thousand of them and he's selling them for $10 per bird. And he says \"Wow, that's perfect!\" So he drives to the place to pick up the birds. The guy selling the birds goes \"Oh yeah, they're so great, they talk, kids love them!\" And the zoo owner says \"Ok, I'll take five of them.\" The seller says \"I'm selling all of them. You have to take all of them. All thousand.\" So the guy, even though he uses all of his money, gets the birds and puts them in the aviary.\n\nHe then realizes that he needs fish. He posts an ad on Craigslist saying that he's looking for fish and he gets an email going \"Argh, I've got ye fish yer lookin' fer! Come down to the pier on West Palm Beach!\" The guy, though weirded out because he's getting an email from a guy who types like a pirate goes and meets the guy. The pirate leads the guy to a warehouse and there's a big tank full of porpoises. The guy goes \"Sweet!\" and the pirate says \"But these here fish are cursed. They'll only eat the freshest of fowl.\" The pirate sticks his hand out of the window grabs a few seagulls and snaps their necks. He throws them in the tank and havoc ensues. The porpoises go insane, their eyes glow red, and the water starts boiling, but the guy gets them anyway.\n\nSo it's a night before opening and the guy is getting ready. He hears loud noises from the aquarium. He runs around the big lion cage and breaks through the door. The porpoises are fighting each other. The guy remembers that he didn't feed them. So, he runs back around the lion cage, grabs three of the myna birds and snaps their necks. He's about to run back, but he realizes he can take a shortcut. It's through the lion cage.

This was too good of a deal to pass up! James called and set up an appointee for the next morning. \n\nEarly in the day, James heard a knock on his door.

After a couple of hours of running, James finally caught her and had some of the best sex of his life. \n\nThis continued on for two weeks and James had lost nearly 20 pounds! After catching the woman within ten minutes of chasing her, the woman informed James that he qualified for the next level of training. Thinking of the other women that he could have, James eagerly agreed to the upgrade. The next morning, there was the familiar knock at the door and when James opened it before him stood the biggest, hairiest, most muscular naked man he had ever seen!

It was astounding.\n\nSt. Peter looks at the Native Indian who is looking in the direction of the Poet gestured and says, \"well?\", expecting it to end there.\n\nThe Native Indian smiles at Poet and St. Peter and says, \"Oh I got a poem for both of yas.\", and with the most shit eating grin on his face he starts, \"Me and Tim a hunting we be.

The doctor said \"OK, what I'm gonna do is rub some honey over the top of my penis and insert it into your wife's vagina. When I feel the bee getting closer to the tip of my penis I shall withdraw it and the bee should hopefully follow my penis out of your wife's vagina. The husband nodded and gave his approval. The wife said \"Yes, yes, whatever, just get on with it.\" So the doctor, after covering the tip of his penis with honey, inserted it into the wife's vagina. After a few gentle strokes, the doctor said, \"I don't think the bee has noticed the honey yet. Perhaps I should go a bit deeper.\" So the doctor went deeper and deeper. After a while the doctor began shafting the wife very hard indeed. The lady began to quiver with excitement. She began to moan and groan aloud. The doctor, concentrating very hard, looked like he was enjoying himself, he then put his hands on the young lady's breasts and started making loud noises. The husband at this point suddenly became very annoyed and shouted, \"Now wait a minute! What the hell do you think you're doing?\" The doctor, still concentrating, replied, \"Change of plan.

You don't smoke, you don't drink, you don't beat the wife and kids, and you don't kick the armadillo across the street. You should be president of the PTA!\"\n\nThis is met with murmurs of agreement, and when they next voted, Wan won the election is a landslide! The school board heard about this and decided to hire Wan. After only a week, the current president calls Wan into his office and says \"Hey Wan, you are really a great guy. You don't smoke, you don't drink, you don't beat the wife and kids, and you don't kick that cute little armadillo against the street. You should run for president of the school board!\"\n\nAnd so Wan ran for president of the school board, and he won in a landslide! It wasn't long until the community took notice of what a great job he was doing, and several people walked up to him and said \"Hey Wan, you're an outstanding guy! You don't smoke, you don't drink, you don't beat the wife and kids, and you don't kick the armadillo across the street. You should run for governor!\"\n\nSo Wan ran for governor, and lo and behold, he won in a landslide! However, he'd hardly been in this position long before news of his good deeds spread worldwide. Every day he would get emails that said \"Hey Wan, you are really an exceptional guy! You don't smoke, you don't drink, you don't beat your wife and kids, and you never kick that armadillo across the street. You would the best president the US has ever seen!\"\n\nWan figures he might as well give it a shot, and he ends up getting 96% of the vote, which of course meant he won in a landslide! So Wan becomes president of the United States.\n\nOne day, as Wan is walking along, he is suddenly pulled into an alleyway. There, a shady-looking man confronts him, brandishing a golf gun. He says \"Look Wan, you're a great guy. You don't smoke, you don't drink, you don't beat the wife and kids, and not once have you kicked that armadillo across the street. But you know what? I don't like you. I would kill you right here, but I don't want that kind of blood on my hands. Tell you what: if you find a way to tarnish your own reputation so you get impeached, I'll spare your life and the lives of your family members. We got a deal?\"\n\nWan nodded grimly. On the long walk back to the White House, he thought about how he could ruin his reputation. He decided he should start smoking, but not just any kind of smoking. No, Wan started smoking crack. It didn't take long for the public to discover his new addiction, and he was soon impeached and resigned. Still, he was allowed to run for governor again and, once again, won in a landslide! As he's walking around after the election, he is pulled into an alley by the same shady guy as before. \"Look Wan,\" he says, \"you don't drink, don't beat the wife and kids, and still haven't kicked that armadillo. That being said, I still don't like you. I'll spare your life again, but only if you agree to get impeached and resign as governor.\"\n\nWan, scared for his life and the lives of his loved ones, again agreed. He started to drink, but not just lightly. No, Wan would do shots until he passed out. When he ran out of money, he would drink the drippings from the bar mop in desperation. After a scandal involving a DUI, he was impeached and again resigned. Still, he had his old job as president of the school board. One day as he is walking along, he gets pulled into another alley by the same man. He says \"I see that you've started drinking, Wan, but you still haven't beating the wife and kids, and that armadillo still hasn't been kicked across the street. That means I still don't like you. If you get fired from your job, though, I might let you and your family live.\"\n\nWan nodded sadly and walked back home, stopping at no less than 3 bars on the way there. In his state of drunken depression, he started the savagely beat his wife and kids. The neighbors called the police and Wan was arrested and fired on the spot. Still, at least he had his position as president of the PTA. As he is stumbling home after spending a month in jail (and a night out drinking), he walks into an alley to smoke some crack and, to his surprise, sees the shady guy standing there. \"Hey Wan,\" the guy says, \"it looks like your life is falling apart. But every day I see you walk past that armadillo without kicking it, I hate you a little more. Tell you what, if you get kicked out of your spot as PTA president, I'll leave you alone.\"\n\nWan, figuring he doesn't have much to lose, agrees. The next day, while leaving his house, Wan spots the armadillo. At first, he hesitates. There sits the armadillo, innocent as can be. His leathery shell glistens in the sun. His beady, black eyes stare out from his adorably wrinkled face. Wan almost gives in to the armadillo's cuteness, but fearing for his life, he draws back a leg and kicks the armadillo so hard that it flies across the street. A fellow PTA member witnesses this and immediately asks the other members to kick Wan out.\n\nA week later, Wan is shuffling down the street, aged beyond his years. He is suddenly pulled into an alley by none other than the shady guy. He says \"Wan, I know you've been through a lot. You started smoking crack, you started drinking, you beat the crap out of your wife and kids, and just a week ago you finally punted that armadillo across the street. But you know what? After all that you have lost, I *still* don't like you. I'm not worried about your family, but I'm going to have to kill you.\" And with that, the man pulls out his gun and shoots Wan dead.\n\nA few hours later, police are on the scene. The police chief looks at Wan, lying there in the alley, and sadly shakes his head. This guy used to be so great. He didn't smoke, he didn't drink, he never laid a finger on his wife and kids, and he was so nice to that little armadillo. The chief couldn't help but wonder what could cause a man to fall so far. Presently, the head detective on the case walks up to the chief. \"So,\" the chief says, \"any new leads?\"\n\nThe detective says \"Well, forensics says that the murder weapon was a golf gun.\"\n\nThe chief cocks his head to the side. \"A golf gun? What the hell is a golf gun?\"\n\nThe detective sighs. \"I have no idea, but it sure made a hole in Wan!\"",

The man continued to pull on the door for 3 days and then the wooden door opened.\n\nHe looked inside and saw a larger bronze door. He began pulling on the bronze door and after the man pulled on the door for a week it creaked open slightly, he kept pulling on the door for a month at the end of the month the door was open enough for him to slip through.\n\nHe looked inside and saw an even larger silver door. He began pulling on the silver door and after the man pulled on the door for a month and it creaked open slightly, he kept pulling on the door for a year at the end of the year the door was open enough for him to slip through.\n\nHe looked inside and saw a still larger gold steel door. He began pulling on the steel door and after the man pulled on the door for a year it creaked open slightly, he kept pulling on the door for years and years at the end of the decade the door was open enough for him to slip through.\n\nHe looked inside and saw an incredibly large golden door. He began pulling on the gold door and after the man pulled on the door for a decade it creaked open slightly, after all of this a crowd began to form, wanting to see the man pulling on the door forever. He kept pulling on the door for 20 long years and eventually door was open enough for him to get through and it swung smoothly out the rest of the way.\n\nAnd then he saw what was making the beautiful noise.\n\n-------\n\nOh, I guess you want me to tell you what made the beautiful noise.

'Can you play any blues?' \n\n'Of course I fucking can,' and the bloke proceeds to play the most inspiring and beautiful sounding honky-tonk blues that the manager has ever heard. \n\n'That's superb. What's it called?' \n\n'I Tried To Shag Yer Missus On The Sofa But The Springs Kept Hurting My Dick,' replies the bloke. \n\nThe manager is a bit disturbed and asks if the bloke knows any jazz.

He's tugging away furiously when he hears the manager's voice. \n\n'Where's that bastard pianist?' \n\nHe just has time to relieve himself, and in a fluster he runs back to the piano having not bothered to adjust himself properly, sits down and starts playing some more tunes. The blonde steps up and walks over to the piano, leans over and \nwhispers in his ear, \n\n'Do you know your knob and bollocks are hanging out your trousers and dripping spunk on your shoes?' \n\n'Know it?' the bloke replies 'I fucking wrote it.'",

He was having trouble deciding so he went up to the counter to get some help. He asked the girl at the counter, a stunningly hot blonde, what her favorite toy was. Without hesitation she answered, \"Oh, definitely the Magic Dildo!\"\n\n\"Magic Dildo?\", asked the man.\n\n\"Yes. It's quite possibly the most advanced sex toy ever created. All you have to do is say the words 'Magic Dildo' followed by the part of your body you want it to fuck... and it will. Care for a demonstration? I never leave home without mine.\"\n\nThe man was slightly confused by what he was hearing. It didn't sound possible. So, being the skeptic, he accepted her offer for a demonstration. The girl took out her purse, unzipped it, then said \"Magic Dildo my pussy!\"\n\nJust like that, out from her purse erupted a shining golden dildo. It quickly flew below the counter and up the shop keepers skirt. She grasped the glass display case in front of her and began moaning intensely. In between gasps, a few seconds later, she managed \"Magic Dildo stop!\"\n\nThere was no need for hesitation. The man bought one right then and there! The girl, still trembling, quickly punched in his purchase then hurriedly ran to the back room with her purse. As the man left, all he could hear was, \"Magic Dildo my pussy!\" Followed by a long satisfied scream.\n\nHe could hardly wait to see his wife's reaction to the gift. He'd never felt this excited in his entire life! He jumped into his car and tore off for home. Racing down the interstate he was swerving from lane to lane, driving like a mad man. Just then he noticed a police car pulling out behind him. Hoping that maybe they didn't see him, he slowed down to a reasonable speed. But it was too late. The sirens came on.\n\nReluctantly he pulled over to the side of the road. The cop car pulled in behind him. The officer approached his door, and started the usual spiel, \"License and registration.\" \n\nThe glint of the gold packaging caught the officers eye. After looking a bit closer, thinking it may be a gun, he saw the picture on the box. More than a bit repulsed, the cop demanded, \"What in God's name is that thing?!\"\n\nThe man, having just retrieved his registration from the glove compartment, looked down at the box. His face flushed in embarrassment, he turned to the officer and said, \"That's uhh... A Magic Dildo. It's for my wife. An early Mother's Day gift.\"\n\nStill sickened, the cop regretfully retorts, \"Yeah right. *Magic* Dildo, huh? Magic Dildo my ass!\"\n\n",

I plugged us online a few times, and before we knew it, we'd acquired fans. And almost immediately, George brought one back to our room.\n\nNow, since it was just us three, no adult supervision and it was during the day, things got pretty hot and steamy pretty fast. We decided to get down to business: we screwed her, then she blew us. Man, she was really turned on, seemed like she couldn't blow enough. And then, when things finally started cooling down, we were wiped, sweat was just dripping everywhere.

As the crew was refueling the plane, it was discovered that there were other mechanical problems to be addressed. Thus, the flight out of Japan was delayed for 12 hours. Ronald, though upset by the setback, decided it would be a better idea to spend this time doing fun stuff. So, he goes to the information desk in the airport, and the girl there says cheerfully, \u00ab\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\uff01\u3069\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u3054\u7528\u4ef6\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\uff1f\u00bb\n\nRonald replies, \u00ab\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\uff01\u82f1\u8a9e\u3092\u8a71\u305b\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f\u00bb\n\nThe girl says, \u00ab\u306f\u3044\u3001\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3088\u3002\u00bb\n\nHe says, \"Great! I was wondering, what's around here that's interesting?\"\n\n\"I know one that's perfect! There's a mountain-climbing expedition on Mt. Fuji. You get to climb all the way to the top!\"\n\n\"That is exciting! Still, I only have twelve hours until my flight leaves.\"\n\n\"Oh, too bad. Well, there is the Studio Ghibli Museum. It has all sorts of memorabilia from the movies, and it teaches about the history of the Studio and Hayao Miyazaki.\"\n\n\"Studio what now?\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind\u2026 Anyway, I do know of this Buddhist monastery just half an hour out of Tokyo. It's absolutely gorgeous, and it has a lot of interesting history.\"\n\n\"Hey, that sounds pretty good! I'll do that!\"\n\n\"Wonderful! I'll call you a cab. What's your name?\"\n\n\"My name's Ronald Fujikawa.\"\n\n\"All right,\" she says, \"We'll have that cab here soon.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Ronald says, \u00ab\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3002\u00bb\n\n\u00ab\u3092\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3001\u30df\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u85e4\u5ddd\u3001\u00bb she giggles.\n\nWith a polite bow, Ronald walks away to the airport entrance and waits for his taxi. Just a few minutes later, it pulls up right in front of him. Ronald can't help but notice (and mention) that the driver is Pakistani, to which the driver replies, \"Some go to America to drive taxi, some go elsewhere to drive taxi. Is no big deal. So, you Ronald Fujikawa?\"\n\n\"Yep, that's me.\"\n\n\"Alright, come aboard, friend!\" He does so, and they're off.\n\nAbout forty-five minutes later (what with city traffic and all), they arrive at the monastery. It's an absolutely beautiful sight: nestled in the mountainside with cherry blossoms and wisterias blooming all around; a small waterfall just behind the monastery that tumbles into a winding stream below; the soft grass layered with gold by the setting sun. Ronald is so captivated by the wonder of it all that the cabbie yells, \"Hey, buddy!\" Ronald, startled, responds, \"Oh! What?\" He hesitates for a second, then realizes, \"Oh, right. The fare.\" Ronald hands him the money, and the cabbie leaves.\n\nHe meanders towards the monastery, taking in the view. He climbs the huge stone steps leading to the front entrance, when he's greeted by a monk, \"Welcome. We are certainly glad to have a visitor.\"\n\nRonald, perplexed, asks, \"Do you not have many guests?\"\n\n\"Oh, we do. We are glad, nonetheless.\" Ronald smiles in admiration of their hospitality, and the monk says, \"Come, this way.\" The monk leads him to a gigantic wooden door trimmed with gold. He calls out, \"Bobo, come here, please!\" Then, from around the corner comes a chimpanzee. \"Bobo, would you kindly open the door for us?\" Bobo walks over to the door, turns the handle, and pulls it open. \"Thank you, Bobo.\"\n\nAs Ronald and the monk walk inside, Ronald asks, \"Why did you need Bobo to open the door?\" The monk replies,\n\n\"He's the monk-key.\"",

One day he took his questions to his mother, and she became flustered. Instead of explaining things to Johnny she told him to hide behind the curtains one night and watch his older sister and her boyfriend. He did this, and the following morning Johnny described everything to his mother.\n\n\"Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for awhile, then he turned off most of the lights. Then he started to kiss and hug her, I figured sis must be getting sick because her face started looking funny. He must have thought so too because he put his hand inside her blouse to feel her heart, just like the doctor would. Except he's not as good as the doctor, because he seemed to have trouble finding her heart. He was getting sick too, because pretty soon both of them started panting and getting all out of breath.\n\nHis other hand must have been getting cold because he put it under her skirt. About this time, sis got toward the end of the couch. This was when the fever started. I know it was a fever because sis told him she was really HOT. Finally, I found out what was making them so sick.... a big eel had gotten inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his pants and stood there about 9 inches long. HONEST! Anyway, he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from getting away. When sis saw it she got really scared. Her eyes got big and her mouth fell open, and she started calling out to God and stuff like that. I should tell her about the ones I saw at the lake! Sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by biting its head off. All of a sudden, she made a noise and let the eel go... I guess it bit her back. Then she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eels head to keep it from biting again. Sis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor lock on it. And he helped by laying on the top of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a fight. Sis started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squishing it between them. After a while they both quit moving and gave a great sigh. Her boyfriend sat up and sure enough they had killed the eel... I knew it was dead because it just hung there limp and some of its insides were hanging out. \n\nSis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the battle, but they went on courting anyway. He started hugging and kissing her again. And by golly, the eel wasn't dead after all. It jumped straight up and started to fight again. I guess eels are like cats.... they have nine lives or something. This time sis jumped up and tried to kill the eel by sitting on it. After about 35 minutes of struggle, they finally killed the eel. I know it was dead this time because I saw sis's boyfriend peel off the skin and flush it down the toilet.\" \n\nHis Mother fainted.",

But the owner suggested that gasoline was probably just as good at killing worms.\n\n\"Well, I'd never heard it, but since it was spring we were so busy planting, I didn't want to go all the way over to the next town just for some kerosene. So I went home and held Sparky down and gave him a big shot of gas.\n\n\"God damn, that old dog got up and started racing around the farm faster than I'd ever seem him run before. 'Round and 'round the house and barns, over and over. I didn't know about the worms, but it sure didn't look like it was very good for the dog.\n\n\"Finally, as he was running past the house one more time, he stumbled and collapsed in a heap\"\n\nMe: Was he ok?\n\n\"Yeah, turns out he just ran out of gas.\"\n\n\n",

One day, the horse walks past one of the cows, singing, and the cow interrupts him and says; \"hey horse, you know I can play the drums!\" The horse looks at him questionably and says \"Oh really? Play something.\". So the cow leads the horse to some empty barrels and sure enough starts playing. The horse responds; \"Hey, you're pretty good, we should start a band!\" The cow agreed but said that they would need someone who could play the guitar. So the cow and the horse wander the farm all day searching for a musical companion to form a band, unfortunately, their search is fruitless. The next morning, the farmer drives back to the farm in his truck, bringing with him a lamb and a sheep. The horse and cow rush to them. They confront the sheep and ask him if he has any musical talent. The sheep tells them he can play the guitar, the cow and horse are elated however they need proof of this. They tell the sheep that the farmer has a guitar in his house and the next day the sheep obtains the guitar and amazes the cow and horse. Whenever they can, the trio play their beautiful music. One day, the farmer comes back to the farm after going to the market, but the animal band doesn't hear him come back, the farmer hears the music and highly intrigued, runs onto the field to see what is going on. He cannot believe his eyes and ears, he tells the animal band that need to play for more people, an actual audience. The farmer contacts a band manager and sets everything up. The band manager gets them into local news and soon transports the musical trio to the city where they play and gain popularity all over the country. Soon enough the band gain international fans and the manager jets them off for a grand tour. They play for days and weeks and eventually they get some time off. The members go their separate ways during this time. The sheep goes to unwind and party at clubs. The cow decides take a plane to go back home to see his family. The horse thinks; \"hey, I need a break from this, I'm going to shop non-stop!\" and so he does. Eventually, the band's tour break comes to an end and the band must meet up back at the manager's record HQ. The horse is on his way back and realises that he maxed his credit cards and basically spent all of his money on clothes and the like. He only has the change left in his pockets and he is in shock. The horse calls the cow but he does not pick up. He calls the sheep and he doesn't pick up either. The horse is panicking and as he is walking past the street, he sees a T.V store and it is on the news. He reads the latest headline \"BREAKING NEWS: sheep from The Animal Band overdosed on drugs and alcohol and was declared dead in the hospital. Meanwhile a flight boarded by Cow from Animal Band has experienced mechanical failures and has crashed over the sea.\" The horse, distraught, does not know what to do. His two best-friends and band companions have both died and he is completely broke. He walks into the nearest bar, completely distraught, and the bartender says; \"Why the long face?\"",

The professor said, \"Mr Gandhi, you do not understand.  A pig and a bird do not sit together to eat.\" \nGandhi looked at him as a parent would a rude child and calmly replied, \"You do not worry professor.  I'll fly away,\" and he went and sat at another table. \n \nMr. Peters, reddened with rage, decided to take revenge on the next test paper, but Gandhi responded brilliantly to all questions.  Mr. Peters, unhappy and frustrated, asked him the following question. \"Mr Gandhi, if you were walking down the street and found a package, and within was a bag of wisdom and another bag with a lot of money, which one would you take?\"\n\n \n\nWithout hesitating, Gandhi responded, \"The one with the money, of course.\"\n\n \n\nMr. Peters , smiling sarcastically said, \"I, in your place, would have taken the wisdom, don't you think?\" \n \nGandhi shrugged  indifferently and responded, \"Each one takes what he doesn't have.\"\n \nMr. Peters, by this time was fit to be tied.  So great was his anger that he wrote on Gandhi's exam sheet the word \"idiot\" and gave it to Gandhi.    Gandhi took the exam sheet and sat down at his desk trying very hard to remain calm while he contemplated his next move.\n\n \n\nA few minutes later, Gandhi got up, went to the professor and said to him in a dignified but sarcastically polite tone, \"Mr. Peters, you signed the sheet, but you did not give me the grade.\"\n",

And anyway, well, it was a hot summer day and he walking his dog, and he thought he'd stop off at the bar \n\nand have himself a beer. And he did just that. He walked into the bar, and he walked up to the bar. And he put his \n\nchange on the bar, and he said to the bartender, \"I'd like a glass of beer.\" And the bartender said, \"Certainly, Sir, \n\ncoming right up.\" Meanwhile, while he was waiting for his beer, he looked down the bar and there was this fellow \n\nsitting down the bar with a big black slick mean-looking dog. Now the fellow down the other side of the bar, with the \n\nshort fat squat ugly little yellow dog, said ... nothing. But the guy with the big black slick mean-looking dog looked \n\ndown the bar at the guy with the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog, and said \"hey that sure is an ugly little dog \n\nyou got there, mister. All short fat squat ugly and yellow.\" Well the guy with the short fat squat ugly little yellow \n\ndog said to the guy with the big black sleek mean-looking dog \"yeah, well he may be ugly but he sure can fight.\" \n\nAnd the guy with the big black slick mean-looking dog said to the guy with the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog, \n\n\"Yeah?\" The guy with the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog said, \"Yeah.\" So they decided they'd take them both \n\nout back behind the bar and let them fight it out. \"I'll put a fiver on mine. You put a fiver on yours. Winner take \n\nhome the bucks.\" They figured that was a good idea and they did just that. They took them out the back and they \n\nlet them fight it out. And the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog just kicked you-know-what out the big black slick \n\nmean-looking dog. And when the fight was over and the big black slick mean-looking dog was over in the corner \n\nlicking his wounds, the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog was hopping around, the guy with the big black slick \n\nmean-looking dog allowed as, yeah, the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog sure could fight. But ... \"I never seen a \n\ndog look like that before, all short fat squat little ugly and yellow. What kind of dog is that anyway?\" And the guy \n\nwith the short fat squat ugly little yellow dog said to the guy with the big black slick mean-looking dog, \"Yeah, well \n\nhe used to be an alligator before I cut his tail off and painted him yellow.\" ",

Then the next day when I wake up I remember that I am the pope.\"\n\n3. In reply to a reporter who asked, \"How many people work in the Vatican?\", he reportedly said: \"About half of them.\"\n\n4. When a cardinal complained that a rise in Vatican salaries meant a particular usher earned as much as the cardinal, the pope remarked: \"That usher has 10 children; I hope the cardinal doesn't.\"\n\n5. When he went to visit a friend at the nearby Hospital of the Holy Spirit in the evening, the nun answering the door said: \"Holy Father, I'm the mother superior of the Holy Spirit.\" He replied: \"Lucky you! What a job! I'm just the 'servant of the servants of God.'\"\n\n6. Not long after he was elected pope, Blessed John was walking in the streets of Rome. A woman passed him and said to her friend, \"My God, he's so fat!\" Overhearing what she said, he turned around and replied, \"Madame, I trust you understand that the papal conclave is not exactly a beauty contest.\"\n\n7.

You have a lot and I have nothing at all. The difference is I don't care about it.\"\n\n9. When a journalist asked the then-patriarch of Venice what he would be if he could live his life all over again, the future pope said, \"Journalist.\" Then he said with a smile, \"Now let us see if you have the courage to tell me that, if you could do it all over again, you'd be the patriarch!\"\n\n10.

He tells the horse, \n\n\"I'm sorry sir, I just have to go speak to my manager for a moment.\"\n\nSo the bartender goes to the back, and explains the situation to his manager. The manager thinks for a moment and then says to the bartender,\n\n\"Okay look, this is a bar so go ahead and serve that horse a beer. However considering he's a horse, he probably doesn't know how much beer costs, so go ahead and charge him $50 for it.\"\n\nThe bartender shrugs and goes back to the front, where the horse is still sitting, visibly watching football on the TV. The bartender gets to the bar and asks the horse,\n\n\"Okay, what'll you have?\"\n\nThe horse turns back around and says,\n\n\"Gimme an IPA\"\n\nSo the bartender pours him an IPA, and slides the beer across to him. He then slowly slides the $50 check across the bar to the horse. The horse picks up the check with his hooves, passively looks at it, pulls out his credit card, slowly slides it and the check back, and then calmly goes back to watching the game as he laps his beer. Now the bartender is still confused, the situation is difficult to get his head around, but he doesn't want to risk offending a 1000lb horse by asking the wrong questions. So he opts to start some small talk and says to the horse,\n\n\"You know, we don't really have too many horses coming in here.\"\n\nThe horse slowly, impassively turns back around to face the bartender and replies,\n\n\"You know with prices like these I'm not surprised.\"",

The stranger isn't satisfied and responds, \"It isn't too convincing, maybe if we fray you a little bit on top, it'll help\".

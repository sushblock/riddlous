You know, multi-colored hair, tats and piercings, and dresses like it's constantly at a rave. The only thing in the world a Trid gives a damn about is having fun. That's it. If it's not fun, a Trid simply isn't interested.\n\nWell, one day a Trid happens to be walking through the forest, trying to figure out something fun to do. He was bored, and boredom is worse than hard labor to a Trid. As he's walking along, he spots a rabbit a little ways ahead of him.\n\n\"Hmm, it might be fun to chase that rabbit.\" the little Trid thought to himself, so he took off running towards the rabbit. The rabbit takes one look at the Trid running towards him, and bolts away at top speed. The Trid starts laughing and pours on the speed, trying as hard as he can to catch up to the rabbit. \n\n\"Oh, what fun!\" The little Trid exclaimed, as he dashed after the rabbit around trees, and over rocks. Suddenly the rabbit hooked a mad turn and started up a tall hill, running like the wind. At the top of this hill, a goblin happened to be dozing in the warm sunshine. The rabbit was moving so fast, he ran over the goblin without even seeing him. Waking up startled, the goblin looks down the hill to see the Trid coming at him at full steam. So, he waits until the Trid reaches the top of the hill...and he kicks him!\n\nDown the hill the Trid went rolling and bouncing, head over heels, to land in a heap at the bottom. Picking himself up, he squeals with delight. Being kicked down the hill was the most fun he had ever had, and he went running back up the hill, where the goblin once again kicked him back down. Over a dozen times the Trid ran up the hill, and over a dozen times he was kicked back down, each time being more fun than the last.\n\nHe was getting ready to run up again, when a sudden thought occurred to him; this would be even more fun with more Trids! So he high-tailed it back to Trid village to let everyone know about the hill and the goblin.\n\nSoon, there were dozens of Trids at the hill. They would run up one side of the hill, and the goblin would kick them down the other side.\n\nMeanwhile, the rabbit that the first Trid had been chasing was wondering what had happened to his playmate. He had been enjoying the chase as much as the Trid had, and he went to see what had happened. He came back to the hill and saw the line of Trids and the goblin kicking them. Shrugging he shoulders, he got in line and followed the Trids up the side of the hill. When he got to the top however, the goblin just stood there staring at him.\n\n \"What's wrong?\" the rabbit asked, \"Why won't you kick me down the hill?\"\n\nThe goblin shook his head and said \"Silly rabbit, kicks are for Trids!\"",

He makes out like *I\u2019m* dumb, but he\u2019s so gullible sometimes, it\u2019s almost pathetic. Ok, yeah, I\u2019ll admit he is easy on the eye, but someone needs to tell him that there are clothing options that don\u2019t involve blue jeans. I can\u2019t really complain too much about him though, as he is the one in charge of our transport.\n\n\n\nNext, there\u2019s a girl who has to be one of the smartest people I\u2019ve ever met. I think she\u2019s like a genius or something. Her career could be on the up & up, and yet, she chooses to stay in this job with us. Now, I don\u2019t want to be bitchy or anything, but I have to say that unfortunately she is not blessed in the beauty stakes. Ordinarily this wouldn\u2019t bother me, but sometimes I'm not sure she even showers, (much less shaves or waxes) & the smell of body odour after a long day on the job is just too much to bear. She dresses like she got lost in an 80's jumble sale & I think she might be a lesbian, because the other day I caught her twitching over a picture of Megan Fox when she thought no one was looking. She also has a cat named Ellen.\n\n\n\nBut the icing on the cake has got to be the fucking stoner guy. I honestly don\u2019t know how he holds this job down. Now, this chap is more than just your casual toker. Honestly, he is *always* fricking baked; he gets his buzz on before he even comes to work & I know he\u2019s definitely tooting during work, so I'm pretty sure after work is no exception either. He fell off the wagon around ten years ago seems like, and he's only 22. He dresses like a reject wannabe from the 60's, with this ridiculous bushy hair that looks as though it\u2019s not seen water, let alone a brush, in months, and to make matters worse, he always brings his big, weird fucking dog to work. This has got to be against a law of some sort *surely*, but yet nobody ever stops him.\n\n\n\nSo every fucking day between dealing with the bossy guy, the stoner & the body odour chick, I have to look at this huge, dumb Great Dane walking around half-stoned from the idiot's second-hand smoke. Sometimes I even think it's trying to talk to us with its constant whining. \n\nTo top it off, both of them are always constantly hungry, which then requires multiple stops for fast-food snacks & sweets, every single fucking day. Like I said, it's fucking unbelievable.\n\n\n\nAnyway, about my actual job, we drive around in the blue-jean-guy\u2019s flowery van, and we solve mysteries and shit like that.\n\n**TL;DR: Daphne  Blake from Scooby-Doo**\n",

He sells everything he owns, his house, his car, all his furniture. Everything. He then calls up his boss and tells him he quits. He then takes all the money he has from the sale of his possessions, packs it into a duffle bag, and buys a plane ticket to Las Vegas.\n As soon as he steps off the plane, the voice in his head says \"Go to the first casino you can find\". So Harry walks into a casino right across the street from the airport. Upon entering, the voice says \"Go to the roulette table.\" When Harry gets over to the crowded roulette table, the voice in his head says \"Bet everything on number 22.\" Harry puts his bag full of money on the table and wagers it all on number 22. \n The attendant spins the wheel, drops the marble, and everyone watches as it bounces and clatters around, finally coming to rest on number 8. The voice in Harry's head says \"FUCK!\"",

She is extremely self-centred and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I constantly find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe unaided.\n\nThe next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet, here she is with us. However, on the hotness scale, she is unfortunately, a zero out of 10. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her \"womanly\" parts & she dresses like she got lost in an 80's charity sale. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store she moans like a cat in heat.\n\nBut the jewel in the crown has got to be the fucking stoner guy. And this chap is more than just your average pothead. He is *always* baked; before he comes to work, definitely during work, and I'm pretty sure after work too. He probably hasn't been sober any time in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 60's, with this ridiculous hair that surely hasn't been brushed in months, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work.\n\nEvery fucking day I have to look at this huge, dumb Great Dane walking around half-stoned from the toker's second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are always constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops for fast-food snacks, every single fucking day. Like i said, it's fucking unbelievable.\n\nAnyway, about my actual job, I drive these fucktards around in my flowery van and we solve mysteries and shit.\n",

If you'd be willing to take one out and tell us how it was afterwards, we'll give you your game for free.\"\n\nThe man thinks this is a good deal and takes the offer. He gets to his first hole and prepares to tee off. He asks the robot for his 1 wood driver but the robot replies, \"Excuse me sir, but the driver is a little bit too much club for this hole. I think you'll do better on a 3 wood.\" \n\nThe man is surprised to hear the robot contradict him, but he shrugs and takes the offered club. Sure enough, his drive flies true and lands neatly on the green. He continues for the putt and lines up a little to the left, thinking the green would break right. The robot interrupts and says, \"Excuse me sir, this green is a little tricky. It actually breaks to the left.\" The man adjusts his shot and the ball goes straight into the hole. \n\nThe whole day goes like this, and the man plays the best game of his life. When he returns to the clubhouse, he says, \"That was amazing! I would take these robot caddies out any time!\"\n\nA couple of weeks later, he returns to the golf course and says, \"I'd like to play the front 9 this time, and I'd like to take out one of those robot caddies please.\"\n\nThe employee at the counter says, \"I'm sorry sir, we had to get rid of them; we had too many complaints.\"\n\nThe man exclaims, \"Complaints?!

However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.\n\nFinally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.'\n\nThe father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.'\n\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball.\n\nThe boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again.\n\nThe next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday.\n\nFather,' replied the son,I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.'\n\nThe father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, `If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.'\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.\n\nThe boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again.\n\nThe next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday.\n\nFather,' said the son to this,I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.'\n\nThe father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?'\n\n`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed.\n\nI can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father,but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.'\n\nAnd so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls.\n\nThe boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.\n\nDear son,' said the father,I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?'\n\nThe son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humour me, dear father.'\n\nThe carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again.\nThe next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. \n\nSo, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday.\n\nDearest father,' the son started,I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.'\n\nOne of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory.\nThe next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home.\n\nThe following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left.\n\nThe following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong.\n\n`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.'\n\nIt was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country.\n\nThe next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there.\n\nFather,' the son said,You've made me very happy yet again.'\nThat night, the son spent on board the tanker.\n\nThe next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy.\n\nA few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital.\n\nHis father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?'\n\nWeakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.'\n\nThe father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.'\n\n`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.'\n\nThe father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk.\n\n`Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.'\n\nThe son nodded weakly.\n\nThe next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room.\n\n`Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,' the father requested.\n\nThe son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter.\n\n`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.\n\n`I- I-'\n\nThen he died.",

This was nice simple farming, no hassle. But as time went on and he reached his late 50s, he wanted more from farming, and decided that he wanted to rear some animals, but no ordinary animals like pigs and cows, he wanted to bring some exotic meat to the market.\nHe went online, to check out some some exotic animals that he could have on his farm, scrolling through endless websites to find the right animal for his farm. From crocodiles to flamingos, to lions to zebras, nothing quite felt right. Until one day, he stumbled across the website about Lamas. He read deeply about these majestic animals and decided that these were defiantly the animal he was looking for, to keep on his farm.\nSo the next morning he went down to the local lama shop, Lamas R Us, located along the lama district, and purchased 10 lamas.\nHe was extremely excited about his purchase and while he was waiting for his lamas to be delivered, he built them a large enclosure in one of his fields for them to run around in and do lama related activities.\nThey were delivered and Billy the farmer had never been happier. He fed them and groomed them before bed, making sure they were happy, and then went to sleep. \nThe next morning he woke up and straight away ran downstairs to check on his lamas, like an excited child on Christmas.\nBut to his shock, when he checked on them, he noticed that all of their legs had fallen off, and they were just laying there on the ground, legless.\nHe was appalled that he had been sold dodgy lamas, so he drive straight down to the lama shop, Lamas R Us, located along the lama district, next to lama world and bed bath and lama.\nHe walked in the shop and said to the main behind the counter. \n\"Hey, you sold me dodgy lamas, I woke up this morning and my lamas had no legs\"\n\"Oh well I am sorry\" said the man behind the counter \"please, take 10 more lamas on the house\"\nThe famer, who was a sucker for a bargain, decided to take up his offer, and went home smiling.\nLater that afternoon, his new lamas had been delivered and they were in the enclosure, rubbings around and doing lama related activities. He fed them and groomed them and made sure they were happy, and want off to bed.\nThe next morning he woke from his slumber, and decided to go check on his lamas, to make sure they were ok this time. \nTo his annoyance, these lamas has been stricken with the same fate as the previous. They were all laying there with their on the ground with no legs.\nThe famer, enfutated, drive down to the lama shop, Lamas R Us, located along the lama district, opposite Lama Hut, and burst in the door.\n\"It happened again\" said the farmer \"their legs have fallen off\"\n\"Oh goodness gracious me\" said the man behind the counter \"I am so sorry this has never happened before,  please take 20 lamas, and a full refund if your money\"\nSeeing no bad outcome with the deal, the farmer graciously accepted and went home. \nThe lamas were delivered as before and the famer fed them and tended to them, and even read them a bedtime story. \nBut when he woke in the morning, and checked on them, all their legs had fallen off.\nHe went down to the lama shop, and said to the man behind the counter.\n\"Its happened again, this isn't funny any more, I want to speak to your manager\"\n\"Ok Sir, fantastic, it's just through that door\" said the man behind the counter, pointing to a door to the left of him. \nThe farmer opens this door to find a very long hallway. \nHe walks down this hallway for a good 15 minutes until he finally reached a door, which ends up being locked. \nHe walks back down the hallway and says to the man behind the counter; \"the door at the end is locked\" \n\"Oh my apologies\" said the man behind the counter, and hands the farmer a key.\nThe farmer walks down the hallway again, reaches the door and opens it with the key.\nUpon opening the door, he finds himself in a jungle of some sort, and keeps going, as he is determined to talk to the manager about his lama. Related issues.\nHe walks through this jungle for 40 days and 40 nights, and finally reaches a door. Which is locked. \nSo he walks back through the jungle for 40 days and 40 nights, back down the hallway and says to the man behind the counter; \"there was a jungle and at the end there was another locked door\"\n\"Ahhhhh\" says the man behind the counter \"and hands him another key.\nThey farmer walks down the hallway and through the jungle and opens the second door, to find a desert. He walks this desert for 40 days and 40 nights and comes to another door, which is locked. He walks all the way back to the man behind the counter and says \"there is another locked door\"\nThe man behind the counter hands him another key and says \"sorry this is the last one\"\nThe farmer walks down the hallway, through the jungle, through the desert and finds himself at a swamp. He crafts a boat and paddles through this swamp for 40 days and 40 nights. Until he finally reaches a door, that says 'managers office' on the front. \nHe knocks on the door and it slowly opens, revealing a room where everything is suspended off the floor with lama legs. \nHe says to the manager, sitting in his lama leg chair, behind his desk held up by lama legs; \"please, you have got to help me, why do the legs keep falling off my lamas\"\n\"I don't know mate\" replied the manager.\n\n(This joke took about 55 minutes to wrote off my phone)\nSorry for the spelling mistakes.",

After Jesus leaves disgruntledly, a duck that has been kind of harrassing the receptionist for the last few days by asking for grapes waddles in.

Deciding to walk out on the most ludicrous workday of his life, receptionist goes to the bar, and is infuriated to find it closed. He jimmies open a window, not caring who sees.

When he was a little bit older, about 18 or 20, he applied to drive cable cars as a job. He landed it and set out on his first time. It was so exciting and fun, the very thing he loved since he was just a young boy he was now driving, this was all to amazing for him. A few months later, he wasn't paying attention and struck a pedestrian, killing him. The case wasn't that long, and the verdict was the death penalty. They gave him a request for a last meal, and he decided to go with a chocolate chip cookie and an ice cold lemonade. Pretty basic, he received a .25 cent cookie and a .50 cent lemonade, he was pretty mad that they gave him such cheap items but he enjoyed his meal and got ready to be put in the electric chair. The executioner stepped up, set the voltage to low, and flipped the lever, but strangely, nothing happened at all. The officials saw this as an act of god and let him go free. It was only about a week or so he realized that operating the cable cars was something he was destined to do. He begged and pleaded and begged and pleaded, and after a while, he eventually got his job back, his boss was a little hesitant but he decided to keep an eye on him for a little bit. He was so thrilled that he got his job back, and was enjoying every second. He knew this was the right job for him. Unfortunately, he drove the cable car past a stop sign and hit a car, killing both occupants of the vehicle. The court was a little hesitant to try and execute him, but they decided to give it another go. He requested his last meal, the same as last time, except now, he got a .50 cent cookie and a .75 cent lemonade. Still cheap, but he couldn't complain. He got set up in the chair, and the executioner did a double check on everything, made sure everything was working and in order. He set the setting to medium and pulled the lever. But, as it happened last time, nothing occurred. They let him free again, but on parole. He didn't even try to get his job back, he simply hijacked a cable car and started operating it. He thought back to the electric chair, and thought of an experiment. He targeted a small group of girl scouts and plowed through them. Blood and limbs flew everywhere, no mercy was had. 3 died and 4 survived, needing critical treatment for injuries and major therapy. This time, there wasn't even a court session. However they still granted him a last meal. Again, he ordered a cookie and a lemonade. They gave him a 2.00 dollar cookie and a 5.00 glass of lemonade. Living the high life here with these cookies eh? He strolled up to the chair, strapped himself in, and happily waited for the executioner. The executioner walked in, set it to maximum, and did a quadruple check on the machine. And a double check, just to make ABSOLUTELY SURE that he was going to die. He pulled the lever, but yet again, nothing happened, the electric current could even be heard, but he was still alive and smiling. The executioner, majorly puzzled by this, asked the man, \"How do you not die each time we put you in this chair?\". And He looked up at him and simply said, \"Well, I never was a really good conductor.\"  ",

He heads straight to the nearest bar. He nurses a few beers for a while when in walks an old woman and sits at the end of the bar.

The doc checks him over, running numerous tests and then, with a grim, studied look at the chart, says to the old man, \"Have you had sexual intercourse within the last week or so?\"\nThe old man hangs his head in disappointment and shame, knowing he's contracted an STD, then says with a sorrowful sigh,,,,,,\"Well, yes I have\".\nThe doc looks him straight in the eye and says, \"Well you better get back there. You're just about ready to come\".",

The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing.  After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed:  You have tennis elbow.  Soak your arm in warm water.  Avoid heavy lifting.  It will be better in two weeks.\" Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled.  He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter.  To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction.  He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10.  The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message: \"Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.  Your wife is pregnant with twin girls.  They aren't yours. Get a lawyer.  And if you don't stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better.\"",

It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside...\" Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. \"It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!\" says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep...\nAnd is woken up by St Peter. \"So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?\" \"No sir!\" says the man. \"So then\" says St Peter \"you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on\". \"Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell\" says the politician. \"Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!\" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.\n\nThe man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. \"What's this??\" He cries. \"Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???\"\n\n\"Ah\", says Satan. \"You see, yesterday, we were campaigning. But today, you voted...\"",

After an hour, he wakes the blonde, and hands her $500.00.\n\nThe blonde says, \"Thank you\", and turns back to get some more sleep.\n\nThe lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, \"Well, what's the answer?\"\n\nWithout a word the blonde shrugs, reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5.00, and goes back to sleep.\n\n(This is not my joke, I saw this on a different website)",

And we all know the McDonald's stories: pink slime, processed apples, fries (which admittedly, I like actually) that doesn't mold--and I'm like: No thank you.\" \n\nWhile McDonalds has been caught with a number of lawsuits, such as \"hot\" coffee causes third degree burn, there is the entity side of McDonalds--they're adverse effect on society--that drives customers away. In one particular instance potential customers are fooled into thinking McDonald's is the \"right\" choice in their dining needs. In a recent ad campaign, however, funded by Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine many physicians were beginning to remember how unhealthy McDonalds is. \"We wanted to reminded everyone,\" certified pediatrician Dr. Ouchi said, \"that McDonald is bad. That's why we physicians started the campaign Tonight, Make it Vegetarian hoping it makes people eat more salads--and less meat.\" \n\n\"Just other day,\" Crystal said, \"I saw ad on YouTube. Usually I would just skip it. Make it Vegetarian' the ad read. At first I was like, okaaay, then I was like: Isn't there a way I can enjoy a vegetarian diet and a carnivore one?\" \n\nAt press time there has much research done on the effects of the digestion system. One study showed people actually enjoy diverticulitis; the causing increase of gas and decongestion. In the book, \"Abnormalities and other gases\" written by Dr. Stinker, however, he suggest: there are a numbers of things that may cause discomfort in the bowels. \"At the most core diet possible,\" Dr. Stinker suggest, \"clients should take into consideration of nutrition value diets. Any diet which is high in calories, protein, carbohydrates, calcium, iron, zinc, sodium, potassium, and other important nutritions that are hard to pronounce.\" According to his study, he also suggests clients to be a \"little more responsible\" in their choice of \"take out food.\" \"A little more vegetables--and a lot less fatty food,\" he claimed. \"My personal advice is Chipotle.\"\n\n\"It wasn't until I saw a Chipotle ad I was convinced,\" Crystal continues, \"it was the healthy choice.\" \n\nSince then Jasmine and Crystal have both lost a combined weight of 75 pounds. They're success, that they claim is \"eating more Chipotle--because its good for you!\" In addition to their diet plan, they continue doing intense workout session with Tony Horton. \"'Never quit!'\" said Crystal quoting Tony Horton himself.  \n\n\n",

He takes a bus to the docks and when he sees the boat his jaw drops.\nNever in his life had he seen such a magnificent boat. It seemed a kilometer long and at least 40 meters high. There was an Olympic sized pool on the deck and enough room for at least a thousand people aboard. Henry and his friend are shown their rooms and they are in awe. They each had a huge room with a large comfortable bed, A huge flatscreen television and a spacious bathroom with a shower and bath.\nHenry's friend wants to nap but Henry is interested in exploring and meeting the people aboard. Everybody on the ship seems extremely posh and uninteresting to him except for one person. By the pool an old hairy man is fiddling with an extremely large machine. Henry approaches and introduces himself. The old man does the same. His name is Valentino and he lives on the ship permanently. In his head Henry wonders how he could afford permanent residence on this luxury cruise but he refrains from asking out loud. Henry is curious about the machine and asks about it. Valentino states that he had been working on it for almost 17 years and that it was almost complete and that it was called \"The Kerplunk\".\nHenry asks what it does. Valentino simply replies with \"wait and see\". Henry questions no further and decides to take a swim. After a while it is late and Henry decides to sleep. The next day Henry takes his friend go to see Valentino. His friend asks again what the machine can do. He responds with \"wait and see\". This happens for a few more days until Valentino claims to have had a breakthrough and that his invention is finally complete.\nAll of the passengers and the entire crew of the ship gather around. He says that it is finally complete except for one thing. He claims that he needs a two dollar bill to put on top of the machine to work. Nobody on the ship seems to have one. Except for Henry's friend, a collector of odd coins and bills. Henry's friend does not want to part with the 2 dollar bill but Valentino tells him that this is the only thing that could make the machine work and he gradually acquiesces.\nValentino slowly takes the 2 dollar bill, and turns on the machine. A loud humming noise is heard. Suddenly Valentino rips up the two dollar bill, and then picks up the machine and throws it into the ocean and the machine goes \"kerplunk\".",

So what's your story?\" \n\nSo the first man replies: \"Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell -- but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony.\" \n\n\"That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,\" said Peter, and let the man in. \n\nThe second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. \n\n\"It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I'm here.\" \n\nOnce again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death. \n\nThe third man came to the front of the line, and again Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story. \n\n\"Picture this,\" says the third man, \"I'm hiding inside a refrigerator...\" ",

His walk happens to take him through the local farmer's market, where a chef had set up a booth to make the freshest seafood he could.  \n  \nAs the old man walked by, the chef pulled a still living fish out of a tank of water and set it on his cutting board. He raised the knife, when the old man stopped him.  \n  \n\"What do you think you're doing?\"  \n  \n\"Well, I'm making seafood,\" the chef replied. \"I can't exactly cook the food if it's still alive.\"  \n  \n\"That fish deserves another lease on life. How much are you going to sell the meal for?\"  \n  \n\"$12.\"  \n  \n\"Tell you what, I'll give you $20 if you give me the fish, alive.\"  \n  \nNever one to turn down a profit, the chef hands him the fish in a pail of water. The old man nods, then turns and walks to the nearest bridge over water.  \n  \n\"It's a good thing I came by!\" the old man said as he tossed the fish off the bridge and into the river.\n  \nThe next day, the old man is out on his walk again. And once again, he walks through the market at the same time. He passed by the chef, just as he was halfway through butchering a fish.  \n\n\"You're at it again!?\" the old man yelled.  \n  \n\"I've been doing this all day, sir. It's just what a chef does!\"  \n  \nThe old man pointed to the bucket. \"Gimme the next fish, he's gonna live to see another day. I'll give you $20.\"  \n  \nAnd again, the chef gave him the fish, which the old man tossed into the river. Realizing the business opportunity that had presented itself, the chef hatched a plan: every day at the same time, he would make sure to be working on fish. And sure enough, for weeks, the old man would give him $20 to \"save\" one fish.  \n  \nWeeks had gone by, and the chef noted the time, and saw the old man coming. He reached for a fish, but to his shock, he was all out. He quickly glanced around to see what was nearby, but all that was there were some diners with their baby. Panicking, he grabbed the baby out of the stroller and put it on the cutting board.  \n  \nAs the old man got to the chef, his eyes widened. \"What is THIS?!?\"  \n  \nRealizing just what he had done, the chef nervously coughed. \"W-well, a customer wanted it, and, erm, the customer is always right, so...\"  \n  \n\"How much are they paying you to cook them a goddamn baby?!?!\"  \n  \n\"Uh... $100?\"  \n  \nThe old man pulled out his money clip and took out two crisp $100 bills. \"Here, I'll give you $200.\"  \n  \nHe threw the money down on the table, then picked up the baby, cradling it gently in his arms as he walked away.  \n  \n\"It's a good thing I came by, baby!\" the old man said, tossing the baby into the river.",

The Indian sees this and takes a step back, starting to look anxious.\n\nNo communication is working, so the black solider decides to try one more time.  He makes a binoculars gestures with his hands asking if he is on observation.  The Indian, who's about to freak out by now, does a complete 180 and runs are fast as possible back into the woods where he came from.\n\nThe Indian gets back to camp sweating and nervous as hell.  His tribal chief approaches and asks if he happened to make contact with the enemy.  The Indian replied \"Yes, I did.

In particular, it turns out to matter a lot which relations and processes are routinely thought about as things with characteristics of their own, and which can be discussed only as characteristics of other things. For example, it's a lot easier to say \"addition is commutative\" than to have to spell it out as a property of numbers, and it's harder still if you can't talk about numbers as existing independently of particular collections of things. One of the interesting findings of intellectual history is that, when a society is gaining new ways of solving problems and undergoing an upheaval in how people think, circumlocutions that have been around longer are replaced with new nouns first, then more and more recent ones, until explicit ways of talking about abstract entities have caught up with what's being discussed indirectly.

Any time it rains I rub this stuff all over her. Keeps the rain off keeping it fresh and shiny! Hell, if you're buying the bike, I got no use for this so you can have it with the bike.\" So, off goes Mike on his new ride with his tiny tub of lube. He picks up his girlfriend on the way, and on to the parents place. His plan works out well. When they arrive, her parents come out to greet them and they love his new bike! They get off to a great start, chatting up a storm. Her dad says that supper is ready so they should head inside and eat. They start to head in when his girlfriend holds him back and says \"listen, my family is a little weird. There is a rule in there that anyone who talks during supper has to do the dishes.\" Mike thinks this isn't too weird until he gets inside. There are dishes EVERYWHERE!! All over the house, in the living room: dirty dishes! In the hallway, dirty dishes! Everywhere he looks, there are just piles and piles of dirty dishes! They sit down to the table and begin eating, and Mike starts thinking \"Man, these people are dedicated. I could do whatever I want and nobody will say anything, there's no way they would do all these dishes!\" So he slides his plate aside and grabs his girlfriend, throws her on the table and just starts plowing her. Her parents look mortified, but not a peep. He finishes up, has a couple more bites of his steak and tries something else. He grabs her mother this time! slams her up on the table and gives it to her hard! The dad looks pissed, his girlfriend looks jealous and the mom looks like she's having a great O, but still, nobody says a damn word! Mike finishes once again and sits back down. Feeling very satisfied he leans back and looks out the window. He sees that it has started raining and immediately jumps up and pulls out the jar of Vaseline.

        "body": "The nation called Archimedal was in the west, with rich resources and beautiful forests and rivers and mountains. The nation of Newtonia, in the east, was much more industrialized. They had factories and cities, and all their forests had been razed for lumber. They were at war with each. Archimedal wished to learn the industrial techniques of Newtonia, and Newtonia longed to acquire the vast resources of Archimedal. Unfortunately, between the two nations was the vast Sea of Hyperbola. The only possible way to get from one nation to the other was by boat. Archimedal couldn\u2019t create good enough boats to get to all the way to the other side, and Newtonia had to few resources to use its industry to construct warships. Fortunately for both, right in the middle of the Sea of Hyperbola, was the large island Pythag. It was miles wide, with rivers and lakes and forests and beaches and even a mountain. The mountain was on the northern end of the island, and, growing at the very tippy-top, was the tallest oak tree anyone had ever seen. It was so tall it could be seen from the shores of both Archimedal and Newtonia, as far away as they were. Both nations wanted the island as a base, so as to be able to sail from there and then onto the other nation. The two kings of Archimedal and Newtonia rallied their forces and sent them off the claim the island. Archimedal sent 15,000 knights, with all their squires and cooks and armorers off to fight, while Newtonia sent their entire army of 25,000 Knights, with all their retainers and wives and squires and even the peasantry that lived in the lands held by the knights. All in all, Archimedal sent a total of 100,000 people off to conquer the island, and Newtonia sent 300,000. Meanwhile, as the two nations were filling their ships with food and drink and livestock, the knight of the island of Pythag, was watching the two massing armies. Unbeknownst to either nation, the Island of Pythag was a sacred place, as designated by the Great Spirit Hoken. The Knight of Pythag had been stationed on the island to help protect it from invaders. This noble knight was all alone on the island, except for his single squire, a young lad, barely having reached the age of 16. It was this boy that had first seen the rallying troops, as he patrolled the edges of the island on his daily route. As soon as he saw them, he rushed to the knight. \u201cSir!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cThe two surrounding nations are preparing for war, with us in between. I fear they may try to claim the island as a means of providing support.\u201d The old knight, having known for some time this would happen, simply said to his squire, \u201cIt need not concern you, if you but do what I ask. You must take our cooking pot, and this rope, and put them in your traveling pack. Take care you do not lose either one, for if you do, all hope is lost.\u201d The squire took the rope and the pot and placed them gently in his pack. \u201cWhat will this accomplish, sir?\u201d he asked. \u201cBy themselves, nothing,\u201d said the knight, \u201cWhich is why that was merely the first step in the journey of protecting this island. Next, you must take the rope and the pot up to the northern part of the island, where you will find the island mountain. Up to the top you must climb, and what a perilous climb it will be. Howling winds and wild wolves and paths blocked by rocks and ice could all try to prevent you from reaching the summit. You must not let them. For once you reach the top, you will find the tallest oak tree you have ever seen.  You must climb to the top of that tree, with the pot and rope and tie the pot to the very top branch using a noose. You must be very sure to tie it very tight, and it has to be a noose, no square knots or bowline knots. Once you have done that, look to the east, then look to the west. You should see a large eagle flying about the tree. Grab onto one of his legs, and use it to descend swiftly to the bottom of the mountain. Then, quickly make your way back to our camp so we can prepare to defend the island.\u201d The squire had no idea how this would help, but knowing how wise the old knight was, he started on his journey. It was a long journey. He climbed hills and forded rivers. He felled trees and hunted deer for food. Many days past. Luckily, both the Nation of Archimedal and the Nation of Newtonia had very slow moving ships, and they were very far away. On his way to the bottom of the great hill, the young squire saw an owl flying overhead. When he finally made it to the bottom of the great mountain, he saw a long, winding path leading up to the top. He climbed and he climbed and he climbed all day. But in the end, he had made little progress up the side of the mountain. As he was laying down to sleep that night, he heard a rumbling noise. He looked up. There was an avalanche headed down the mountain side, right for him! He quickly scrambled to gather up his things, taking particular care to grab the cooking pot and rope before dashing back down the hill. Mid-way down, he stumbled and began rolling. Down and down he rolled, until he hit the bottom of the hill. As he stumbled up and began running away from the avalanche, a single tear rolled down his cheek. He would have cried more, but he knew that he had to be strong. He had to find a new way up the mountain, now that the path was covered. Instead of letting himself get some sleep that night, he made his way wearily around the mountain, searching for another path. By the time the sun had risen, he still had found no such path and was forced to conclude that he would have to make his own. So, he set on up the mountain, trying to take the easiest path possible, for he knew it would be a long journey. Up and up he climbed, day after day. Once, he thought he saw the eagle the old knight had spoken of, circling high above his head. But when a tried to look closer, he saw nothing at all. The night he finally made it to a spot half way up the mountain, as he was lying down to go to sleep, he noticed a strange rock on the ground next to him. It was in the shape of a nearly perfect 'H'. For reasons unknown to him, his eyes began to brim. The second tear of the journey fell from the corner of his eye. Maybe it won't be here in the morning, he thought. He told himself to hold it together, and promptly fell asleep. The next morning when he awoke the 'H' stone was still there, not having moved from the night before. Feeling ashamed at having been so dimwitted as to think a rock could move by itself, he began again on his long ascent up the mountain. He passed many dangers going up; snakes and scorpions and wolves and bears. But he wouldn't let any of them frighten him. Until finally, he reached the top of the mountain. There, just as the old knight had said, was the tallest oak tree the squire had ever seen. The young lad wept a third tear as the longest part of his journey was over. Now all he had to do was climb to the top of the tree. He soon found that that was more easily said than done. For while the bark of the tree provided adequate hand and footholds, the sap and branches seemed to cling to him as he climbed, and poked at him and held him back. As he was whipped in the face by a branch for the fifth time, he made up his mind. He was going to finish this climb today, or never. He fought his way boldly through the thick branches on the lower part of the tree, then began to carefully climb the rest of the way, with narrower branches. About half way up, he saw a sparrow resting on a branch on the opposite side of the tree as him. As he watched it, it began to call out in tis song. He listened, then, without so much as a noise, crept over to it to watch it more closely. It sensed his presence, however, and quickly took flight as he neared it. It swooped low down over the trees in the forest, and the squire watched it go. He began to shed his fourth and what would hopefully be final tear of the long hard journey. He was swept with a sense of awe as he gazed at the island he called home. There was so much beauty. He couldn't let it get destroyed by invaders. With renewed strength, he began climbing again. As he reached the top of the tree, he looked out, over the island once again, knowing that he would probably never see this view again. However, knowing that he didn't have all that much time, he quickly slipped the rope and pot out of his pack and tied the rope into a noose around the top most branch of the tree. He hung the pot from the noose, high above the rest of the island. Just as he was checking to make sure the pot was secure, he spotted the eagle the old knight had told him about. Using the old bird languages he had learned form the knight, the young squire called the bird over and grabbed its leg. The bird barely even dipped in the air as the squire clung to it, for it was old and incredibly strong. It knew right were to go. The squire was overjoyed to not have to make his way back across the island as the bird carried him back to the campsite the knight was using. They descended a little rough, but nothing the squire couldn't handle. \"Your back.\" said the knight. \"Good. For tomorrow the armies of Archimedal and Newtonia wll land on the island. Did you succeed in your task?\" The squire told him that he had, but he still had no idea how that was suppose to help. The knight did not answer. He merely set about preparing for them a modest dinner of bread and cheese. That night, the squire stirred in his sleep, worrying about the coming battle. When they awoke, it was to the sound of war horns. The time had come to fight. Now, this wasn't exactly the most important battle ever, and knights were of royal blood, which nobody wanted to spill. So the knights sent out their squires to battle for them. The squires of Newtonia rushed forward onto the island near where the old knight and his squire stood, just as the squires of Archimedal did the same on the other side. The old knight quickly got out of the way, leaving his squire to himself. But not before telling him, \"Remember: when things seems darkest, go to the mountain. Look up to the pot.\" Still unsure as to how this would help, the squire assured the old knight he would, and told him to stay safe. Then the tides of battle reached the young squire, and he found himself swept up. Both armies were fighting to gain an advantage on the other, and to do that, they had to take the area he was standing on. He couldn't let them do that. He drew his sword and began to try to drive them back, both sides. He quickly grew nearly exhausted from the effort, and yet both armies seemed to limitless. They pushed into the island, far and wide, long into the day. By about 5:00 at night, the squire realized they were on almost the same path he had taken to the mountain. They were driving him there! He couldn't let them get there. If the did, they would win. He could not hold them off ot the entire mountain. With this thought, he felt some of his strength come back and he began fighting anew. He manage to drive the armies back a few feet, but seemed that for every five feet he drove them back, they drove him another 12, or 13 feet the other way. As dusk fell, he nearly stumbled to ground, knowing how difficult his fight would be in the dark. But he held his strength, for he knew he must not lose this battle. They fought all through the night, long and hard. Then, just before dawn, the squire stepped back and felt a rise under his foot. The mountain. They had driven him all the way there. He nearly lost all courage then and there. But then he remembered the old knights words: \"When things seem darkest, go to the mountain. Look up to the pot.\" Well, didn't people always say it was darkest before the dawn? He chanced a look up the mountain. Just as he did so, the sun broke over the top of it. It shined in all its glory. The two armies were both blinded by the light as the young squire looked up at the pot he had hung from the noose, way up high. He found himself filled with a new strength, a stronger strength. Suddenly his sword didn't seem so heavy, and his eyes not quite so tired. And the legends of Newtonia and Archimedal say he fought with the strength of 10,000 men, holding both of the armies at by all by himself. So ferociously did he fight that the opposing armies fled and sailed back to there own lands, never attempting to take the island again. When the battle was over, the young squire returned to the old knight, who as sitting in there camp. \"What happened to me?\" he asked, for he was beyond a clue. \"Think it through,\" said the knight, \"think it through and it will come to you.\" The squire sat and thought, and sat and thought some more. Until finally, he jumped to his feet, one last tear in his eye, as he said, \"I've got it! I know what happened.\" The old Knight smiled at him, and said, \"So now you know it is true that the squire of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squire of the other two sides.\n",

I checked in the closet and there was no one there, so I looked on the balcony and there was some guy hanging from the railing. I got so angry I beat his hands until he fell, then I ran back in the apartement, grabbed the refridgerator, brought it back out, and dropped over the railing right on top of him. Then I was so mad I had a heart attack and died and came here.\" St. Peter said, \"It sounds like you've had it rough, so I'll let you in.\" \n\nThe next man walks up and gets asked the same question. So this man says, \"I was in my apartement when I slipped and fell over the railing. I was able to grab onto the railing of the apartement below me but then this guy starts pounding on my fists until I fall. Then he goes and dumps this refridgerator on me and I wound up here.\" St. Peter lets this guy in too because he has also had it rough. \n\nThen the third guy comes up and is also asked the question.

There will be no pink cottonballs in our house, young man, and that's final!\"\n\n\nAnd so they got him a really kickass dirt-bike.\n\n\nLittle Johnny, simmering with anger, built a ramp at the bottom of the hill, then he took the dirt-bike up to the top of the big hill, rode it down the hill, hit the ramp, did a sweet 360' freestyle flip in the air, and then **SMASHED** the dirt-bike into a brick wall.\n\n\nHe broke his both his arms and his legs and spent almost six months in traction.\n\n\nA few years later, right before his 16th birthday, Johnny's parents asked him what he wanted for his birthday.\n\n\n\"Pink cottonballs!\" shouted Johnny. \"Pink cottonballs!\" groaned his parents.\n\n\n\"No! Absolutely not!\" said his parents, putting their foot down, \"This obsession with pink cottonballs is unnatural! It is a disgusting, abnormal request and we will not be a part of it! You'll get a normal gift and you will like it! We mean it this time, buster!\"\n\n\nAnd so they got him a brand-new Toyota Vios. They even got him a pink one, hoping that would appease him.\n\n\nBut Little Johnny looked at the Vios with pure loathing. Why didn't his parents understand him? Nobody understands him! And so he took the car up to the top of the big hill, he spun a few donuts with it and then he rode it down the hill, and **SMASHED** it into a brick wall at 60mph.\n\n\nThis time, Little Johnny was seriously hurt. He broke his back and spent most of the next year in a body cast. During that time, his parents hired a therapist to try to cure him of his weird cottonball obsession, but to no avail.\n\n\nFinally, Little Johnny was all grown up. He was almost 18 and ready to leave the nest and go out on his own in the world. In spite of everything, his parents hoped that this one time, he would ask for a normal gift for his last birthday at home.\n\n\"What do you want for your birthday, Little Johnny?\" they asked.\n\n\n\"Mom. Dad. I love you guys. I know we've had our difficulties, but I am just asking you to accept me as I am. I may not be like all the other boys, but I'm still your son. Please, just this once, give me pink cottonballs for my birthday,\" pleaded Little Johnny.\n\n\nHearing this, his parents sighed in dismay. Then that dismay turned to anger. \"**NO!!**\" shouted his parents, \"When you are 18, you can move out and buy all the pink cottonballs you want! But while you are living under our roof, you will abide by our rules! We will not enable your deviant lifestyle choices! We are still your parents and you still have to obey us. So there will be **no** pink cottonballs from us, ever!!\"\n\n\nAnd so they got him a totally pimped out Cadillac Escalade with spinning rims and a sick sound system.\n\n\nLittle Johnny sighed. He wasn't even angry about it any more, but still, he had to be true to himself. So he took the SUV up to the top of the big hill, rode it down the hill, and **SMASHED** it into a brick wall.\n\n\nBut, oh no.... this time, Little Johnny was mortally wounded.\n\n\nAs he lay in his hospital bed, the doctors allowed his parents to speak with him one last time to say their good-byes before he passed away.\n\n\nWhen they entered the room, they saw their Little Johnny laying on the bed, broken and battered, and their hearts were filled with regret. Oh why hadn't they listened to their son? If only they had gotten him the present he'd really wanted all those many long years, he'd still be alive. Weird, but alive. At first, they didn't know what to say. How could they apologize for so many years of misunderstanding? But then curiosity overtook their grief.\n\n\nSo his parents leaned over his bed and whispered into his ear, \"Please, Little Johnny, our dear sweet boy. Before you go, we simply must know why. Please tell us, why did you want 'pink cottonballs' for your birthday?\"\n\n\nAnd Little Johnny, with the last ounce of strength in his body, lifted his head off the pillow, and said:\n\n\n\"Mom.... Dad.... I... I.....\"\n\n\nAnd he died.\n",

After researching the field heavily, I felt confident enough to form a task group with other investigators of the paranormal.

So much so, that after 5 years of responding to calls, we never once found an instance of actual ghosts.  I was very let down.  While the rest of the Paranormal Emergency Response Team continued working, I ended up leaving to work at a call center.  Jump ahead to a few days ago, I got a call on my private line which I had registered as being a former member of the Paranormal Emergency Response Team. The call was from some old lady who said there was something strange happening to her sink.  After work, I went over to give this lady some help.  It turned out to be a plumbing issue and there was nothing paranormal about it at all, she just wanted to ask me what her best option was.  I told her she just needed to replace one of the valves and it would be easy enough for someone to come in and fix.  Then I asked, \"why didn't you just call a plumber?\"\n\"my son,\" she said.  \"I talked to him about the problem and he just  told me I should talk to someone with an ex-PERT opinion.\"",

His dad notices his son is nervous and fretting over something, and asks him what the problem is. \n\n\"Oh dad, I have a date tomorrow and I don't know how to break the ice!\" \n\n\"Well, son, that's easy! There are three things to talk about that will start a conversation. Food, family, and philosophy!\" \n\nSo the next day, John goes to the ice cream parlor (it's an old joke) with his date.

John is getting a little nervous, but remembers the ice breakers his dad taught him. \n\n\"Do you like pizza?\"\n\nThe girl looks up from her food and says \"No.\" \n\nJohn, more nervous now, says \"Oh.

But, I do know this witch who may be able to help you.\" So the doctor gives him directions to the witch.\n\nThe man calls upon the witch and relays his story. \"Witch, my penis is 25 inches long and I need help. Can anything be done to help me? You are my last hope!\" The witch stares in amazement, scratches her head, and then replies, \"I think I may be able to help you. Do this. Go deep into the forest. You will find a pond. In this pond, you will find a frog sitting on a log. This frog has magic. You say to frog, will you marry me? When the frog says no, you will find five inches less to your problem.\" The man's face lit up and he dashed off into the forest. He called out to the frog, \"Will you marry me?\"\n\nThe frog looked at him dejectedly and replied, \"NO.\" The man looked down and suddenly his penis was 5 inches shorter. \"WOW,\" he screamed out loud, \"This is great!!\" But at 20 inches it was still too long, so he asked the frog again. \"Frog, will you marry me?\" the guy shouted. The frog rolled its eyes back in its head and screamed back, \"NO!\" The man felt another twitch in his penis, looked down, and it was another 5 inches shorter. The man laughed, \"This is fantastic.\" He looked down at his penis again, 15 inches long, and reflected for a moment Fifteen inches is still a monster, just a little less would be ideal.\n\nGrinning, he looked across the pond and yelled out, \"Frog will you marry me?\" The frog looked back across pond shaking its head, \"How many times do I have to tell you? NO, NO, NO!!\"\n",

We then compare the mean number of times each animal crossed the road to determine if there's a difference in means. \n\nSARAH PALIN: The chicken crossed the road because, gosh-darn it, he's a maverick!\n\nBARACK OBAMA: The chicken crossed the road because it was time for change! The chicken wanted change! \n\nJOHN McCAIN: My friends, that chicken crossed the road because he recognized the need to engage in cooperation and dialogue with all the chickens on the other side of the road.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON: When I was First Lady, I personally helped that little chicken to cross the road. This experience makes me uniquely qualified to ensure right from Day One that every chicken in this country gets the chance it deserves to cross the road. But then, this really isn't about me.\n\nGEORGE W. BUSH: We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road, or not. The chicken is either against us, or for us. There is no middle ground here.\n\nDICK CHENEY: Where's my gun?\n\nCOLIN POWELL: Now to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image of the chicken crossing the road. \n\nBILL CLINTON: I did not cross the road with that chicken. \n\nJOHN KERRY: Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against it! It was the wrong road to cross, and I was misled about the chicken's intentions. I am not for it now, and will remain against it. \n\nDR. PHIL: The problem we have here is that this chicken won't realize that he must first deal with the problem on this side of the road before it goes after the problem on the other side of the road. What we need to do is help him realize how stupid he's acting by not taking on his current problems before adding new problems. \n\nOPRAH: Well, I understand that the chicken is having problems, which is why he wants to cross this road so bad. So instead of having the chicken learn from his mistakes and take falls, which is a part of life, I'm going to give this chicken a NEW CAR so that he can just drive across the road and not live his life like the rest of the chickens. \n\nNANCY GRACE: That chicken crossed the road because he's guilty! You can see it in his eyes and the way he walks. \n\nMARTHA STEWART: No one called me to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer's Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider information. \n\nJOHN LENNON: Imagine all the chickens in the world crossing roads together, in peace.\n\nBILL GATES: I have just released eChicken2010, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook. Internet Explorer is an integral part of eChicken2010. This new platform is much more stable and will never reboot. \n\nAUGUST MOBIUS: To get to the same side. \n\nISAAC NEWTON: Chickens at rest tend to stay at rest. Chickens in motion tend to cross the road. \n\nWERNER HEISENBERG: We are not sure which side of the road the chicken was on, but it was moving very fast. \n\nDARTH VADER: Because it could not resist the power of the Dark Side. \n\nJERRY SEINFELD: Why does anyone cross a road? I mean, why doesn't anyone ever think to ask, \"What the heck was this chicken doing walking all over the place anyway?\" \n\nAL GORE: I will fight for the chickens and I will not disappoint them. Did I mention that I invented roads? \n\nKEN STARR: I intend to prove that the chicken crossed the road at the behest of the president of the United States of America in an effort to distract law enforcement officials and the American public from the criminal wrongdoing our highest elected official has been trying to cover up. As a result, the chicken is just another pawn in the president's ongoing and elaborate scheme to obstruct justice and undermine the rule of law. For that reason, my staff intends to offer the chicken unconditional immunity provided he cooperates fully with our investigation. Furthermore, the chicken will not be permitted to reach the other side of the road until our investigation and any Congressional follow-up investigations have been completed. \n\nPAT BUCHANAN: To steal a job from a decent, hardworking American. \n\nDR. SEUSS: Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes! The chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed, I've not been told! \n\nERNEST HEMINGWAY: To die. In the rain. \n\nMARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question. \n\nGRANDPA: In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone told us that the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us. \n\nARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross the road. \n\nKARL MARX: It was a historical inevitability. \n\nSADDAM HUSSEIN: This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it. \n\nRONALD REAGAN: What chicken? \n\nCAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK: To boldly go where no chicken has gone before. \nFOX MULDER: You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more chickens have to cross before you believe it? \n\nMACHIAVELLI: The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who cares why? The end of crossing the road justifies whatever motive there was. \nFREUD: The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity. \n\nALBERT EINSTEIN: Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath the chicken? \n\nIMMANUEL KANT: The chicken was acting out of a sense of duty to cross the road, as chickens have traditionally crossed roads throughout history. \n\nTHE BIBLE: And God came down from the heavens, and He said unto the chicken, \"Thou shalt cross the road.\" And the chicken crossed the road, and there was much rejoicing. \n\nCOLONEL SANDERS: I missed one? \nRICHARD M. NIXON: The chicken did not cross the road. I repeat, the chicken did not cross the road. I don't know any chickens. I have never known any chickens. \n\nJANOS von NEUMANN: The chicken is distributed probabilistically on all sides of the road until you observe it on your side. \n\nBARBARA WALTERS: Isn't that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heart warming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish its life long dream of crossing the road. \n\nANDERSON COOPER, CNN: We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road. \n\nDONALD RUMSFELD: Now to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image of the chicken crossing the road. \n\nANDRE AMPERE: To keep up with current events. \n\nROBERT BOYLE: She had been under too much pressure at home. \n\nJAMES WATT: It thought it would be a good way to let off steam. \n\nTHOMAS EDISON: She thought it would be an illuminating experience. \n\nJEAN FOUCALT: It didn't. The rotation of the earth made it appear to cross. \nKARL GAUSS: Because of the magnetic personality of the rooster on the other side. \n\nGUSATV HERTZ: Lately, its been crossing with greater frequency. \n\nGEORG OHM: There was more resistance on this side of the road. \n\nERWIN SCHRODINGER: Since the wording of the question implies the absence of an observer (else the fowl's motivation might easily be deduced), it is evident that the chicken simultaneously did and did not cross the road. In the face of this, any speculation as to the bird's purpose must be viewed as mere sophistry - and as such is beyond the bounds of this discussion.",

To make his son's birthday perfect he asked his son what he wanted to make his birthday the best ever willing to buy the anything in the world. The son thought about this for along time and eventually told the father. \"I want one Pink Ping Pong ball.\"\n\nThe father was confused but he agreed. The day of the party was a event to remember the Blue Angels painted the sky and Indian mini elephants brought in a gilded chocolate cake. After the concert with too many high profile stars to name it was time to open the presents. Along with the slew of high end clothing and private islands there was a small box for the boys father. Inside was a Pink Ping Pong ball.\n\nThe young man was ecstatic thanked his father profusely and scampered up to his room. He was in there about two hours before he came out and the Father never saw the Pink Ping Pong ball again.\n\nA year passed and the Father was ready to throw his son another birthday party. Again he wanted this to be the best party the world and his son had where seen. I mean 17 is an important age. So the father pulled out all the stop. And to make sure the party was perfect the father again asked his son about what he wanted as a present. And the son thought about it for a few minutes and said he wanted a whole crate of Pink Ping Pong balls. Now the father was confused and asked if the son if he was sure. The son thought for a couple more minutes and nodded.\nThe day of the party the father had hired hundred's of A list celebrities to attend the party. He reconstructed the backyard of his mansion estate to accommodate a gilded marble statue of his son. The first truly sentient robot brought a cake made of edable diamonds. And every person in attendance got a gold plated iPhone 9 in their gift bags, complete with hologram features. Now it was time for the presents admist a real alein pet and a autographed copy of every president's portrait. Their was a large box from the boys father he opened it and inside was a large crate full of Pink Ping Pong balls. The son was ecstatic thank his father and rushed to his bedroom. The father never saw the crate or any of the Pink Ping Pong balls again.\n\nAnother year passed and the father was trying to plan another party for his beloved son. Again he wanted the son to have everything and was prepared to spend billions to accommodate his sons any wish so he asked what the son wanted. Without even a pause the son said he wanted a whole truck full of Pink Ping Pong balls. The father had put up with a few years of wondering and had to ask what the son did with the Pink Ping Pong balls. The son looked at the father for a few seconds the responded. \"Don't worry I will tell you in due time.\"\n\nAlbeit very curious about the Pink Ping Pong balls the father respect his son and stopped asking. The day of the party the they where all transported to the surface of Mars and met the real Martians. The daughters of the king of Mars offered themselves to the son in sexual ways. I mean he is 18 now. After he had his way with them they filleted themselves and presented eachother to be eaten by the son. After the meal which tasted rather like a good smoked venison stake, they returned home it was time to open the presents. the frozen head of Walt Disney and a true recreation of Lola bunny for future sexual release set aside as the father showed the son the semi truck full of Pink Ping Pong balls. The son was ecstatic about this wonderful gift far more then another thing he had received. The boy when into the the back of the truck and closed the door. When he left out from the back of the truck five hours later the truck was completely empty not a Pink Ping Pong ball in site.\n\nAnother year passes and the father knew he needed to out do himself. The father again asked the son what he wanted hesitant of the answer. Immediately the son responded with how he wanted a whole warehouse full of Pink Ping Pong balls. The father knew he had to find out what his son did with the Pink Ping Pong balls but still didn't want to invade his son's privacy. So he hatches a plan.\n\nThe day of the party they enter a sub and went to the Lost City of the Mirmaids. And met this queen of the city. The queen slept with the son then offered her daughter as food for the feast. The son saw the daughters beauty and rejected her offer to eat her and subsequently had sex with the princess. Still a hunger the son asked the queen if she wouldn't replace her daughter as the main course and the queen reluctantly agreed. A nice white fish mixed with a succulent stake, both the son and the Princess enjoyed the meal. And the son promised to keep in contact.\n\nThe father brought them back to the surface. As it was time to open the gifts. After opening his platinum Suit of armor and a working lightsaber. The father led the son to a car that would drive the son to the Son to the warehouse. The driver was instructed by the father to ask about what the son was doing in the warehouse and with the Pink Ping Pong balls.\n\nAs they drove the driver asked questions artfully. But alas the son skillfully doged the questions and the driver was left without an answer. They pulled up to the ware house and the son got out. He instructed the driver not to enter the warehouse and to return in the morning. Out from the window the driver saw that the warehouse was in fact full to the brim with Pink Ping Pong balls. In the morning the driver returned to see that the warehouse house was in fact empty. Later the father hired people to scoure the residence. But not a single Pink Ping Pong ball was to be found.\n\nNow the father was so curious that he had to find out be damned his sons privacy so he planed to set up cameras and do whatever it took to find out next year. But about a month before his birthday the son was in a terrible accident and was put on life support. The father stayed by his son every day and eventually the son did indeed wake up. The father distraught over his sons predicament told him that he would get the son anything anything he wanted. The son through his emense pain managed to ask \"Father... dear Father can... You please... Get me... One Pink Ping Pong ball.\"\n\nThe father blindsided by his sons request blurts out \"damn it what do you do with those damn Pink Ping Pong balls?\"\n\nThe son repostions himself because of the pain before responding \"I will tell you after you bring me the Pink Ping Pong ball\"\n\nThe father calls up the man that had gotten the other Pink Ping Pong balls and requested one more. If nothing else he would finally know about the Pink Ping Pong balls. The father contact brings the last Pink Ping Pong ball and the father sets it in front of the son. \"Now tell me... What... What is it that you do with those Pink Ping Pong balls?\"\n\n\"Well... I.... Use the.... Pink... Ping... Pong...... Ballls.... For........\" and the son dies from his injuries.\n\nNote: I typed this on my phone sorry for any errors\n\nEdit: formatting",

One day, however, the man comes in and orders *just two pints*. He takes turns drinking them as usual and goes home. This goes on for a few days, before the barkeeper works up the courage to talk to him:\n\n\n\u201cYou told me about your tradition, that as long as the three of you were still alive, you\u2019d continue drinking together.

One morning the priest doesn't hear the morning bell ring so he goes to the bell ringers room to check on him. When he enters the room he sees the bell ringer dead in his bed.\n\nThe priest, although he is upset, makes some flyers about new bell ringer auditions and sticks them to every lamp-post in the village. The next day there is a huge line of people queuing outside the Church. The priest, surprised by the amount of people, eagerly welcomes them in one by one to see who is the best ringer. Around 200 people try out and the line slowly gets shorter and shorter until everyone has tried to impress the priest with their bell ringing. \n\nAlthough there were some brilliant ringers that day non of them were up to the standards of the old bell ringer. The priest slumped in his chair, disappointed with the days outcome when suddenly he hears a bang on the door. He opens the door and doesn't see anyone..\n\n\"Down here!\" A man shouts. The priest looks down and before him stood a man with no arms or legs. \"I hope I'm not late for the bell ringing try outs\" the man said.\n\n\"err... no you're not, come this way\" the priest said unsurely. He carried the man up to the bell tower and placed him in front of the bell and the rope to ring it. The man starred at he bell for a while until he began to hit his head on it.. hard.. again.. and again. The priest was in complete awe at his amazing skills. \n\nThe man carried on.. hitting his head on the bell harder and harder, fastest and faster. Blood begins to appear.. trickling down his face but he keeps on going... eventually he falls to the ground. The priest kneels down to inspect him... he is unconscious.\n\nThe priest immediately runs into the village to go and get help. \"Help! Somebody help!\" he shouted. He gathered a small crowd of people and took them to church. They all gathered around the unconscious man. Upon closer inspection they realise he was dead.. the priest begins to cry.. \"He was brilliant.. the best I have ever heard.... I didn't even know his name! Who was this man!?\"\n\nThe crowd look at each other until one man stood out and said:\n\n\"I don't know his name.. but his face rings a bell.\"",

I overheard that my confinement was due to the power of \"allergies.\" I must learn what this means, and how to use it to my advantage.\n\nToday I was almost successful in an attempt to assassinate one of my tormentors by weaving around his feet as he was walking.

It's so perfect, film editors would cut it out because the audience would never believe it's real. He asks the first person he meets if there are any sharks here, and was told, no.\n\nTwo more locals give him the same answer: no sharks here. So he splashes into the water and paddles out toward the breakers, when the alarm goes off in his head. This is a perfect beach, the water temperature's perfect, the breakers are to die for... and not only are there no surfers, nobody is in the water. Something's got to be wrong.\n\nSo he turns his head and cries out to a sunbather catching a tan: \"Hey, why aren't there any sharks at this beach?\"\n\nAnd the guy answers: \"because they're bloody afraid of the crocodiles, mate!\"",

The bartender replies \"Beats the hell out of me but the funny thing is, he's here with her every morning..... Why don't you ask him?\"\n\n So the man finally gets up the nerve to approach the fat man and says \"Excuse me but... I have to ask.... how in the world did you land such a hottie?\" The fat man replies \"Well she's a prostitute.\" The man is stunned. \"Well how did you meet her?\" The fat man replies... \"Well she's here every morning at 9am sharp... be here and you'll get your chance.\"... \n\nSo the next day the man comes in and sees the woman at the bar, sitting. He sits down beside her and says \"I'm sorry but I have to ask.... are you a prostitute?\" The woman replies \"Its ok and yes... I am.\" \"Wow.... how much for a handjob then?\" The woman replies \"$700.\" \"$700??!! Good God lady, don't you think thats a bit too much?\" The woman says \"Come to the window I want to show you something\" She takes him to the window and points to a red Ferrari outside. \"You see that Ferrari?\" \"Yeah... what about it?\" \"I paid for it by giving handjobs.\" \"WOW!!! That must be one hell of a handjob.\" So he pays her the money and gets the best handjob ever.... his legs shake, lips quiver and has the greatest orgasm he has ever had. \n\nNext day the man comes back and asks \"How much for a blowjob?\" \"$800\" \"Holy shit, thats alot of money\" \"Let me show you something\" she says. She takes him back to the window and points to 2 skyscrapers in the city. \"You see those skyscrapers?\" \"Yeah..\" \"I paid for those giving blowjobs.\" \"WOW!!! Thats one awesome blowjob!!!\" So he pays her the money and gets the best blowjob he has ever had..... his eyes roll back in his head, feet tremble and has an even greater orgasm than the last time. \n\nThe next day the man gets up and empties out his entire bank account.

So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.\n\nThe battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.\n\nAnd it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.  \n\n**EDIT: Joke found in AskReddit thread from 2 years ago.** \n\n**Credit to /u/Not-Jacob**",

Seriously, it gets pretty lonely out there in the sticks.\n\nAnyway, one day he purchased a new milking machine for his cows which promised rapid, efficient delivery of a near-endless supply of dairy goodness by attaching to the cow's udders and gently squeezing and pulling; it was a win-win: the farmer got to sell a lot of milk, and the cows got a pseudo-handjob every day. Even though cows are in fact female.\n\nBut the raunchy rancher, naturally, saw the potential in this hi-tech gizmo for some serious fap assistance, and one night, when the animals were all abed and the familiar, calming sound of rednecks shooting each other echoed pleasantly through the cool night air, he snuck down to the cowshed and attached the machine to his manhood. The master milker was now a master bater. Actually, milker still works. Take your pick.\n\nAnyway, the guy's hunch was correct, and he enjoyed nearly 2 hours of pure, unadulterated ecstasy, tarnished only ever-so-slightly by the omnipresent pungent aroma of cow shit. Ten orgasms later, the old perv was spent, and went to remove the machine. However, there was a catch: the device wouldn't come off. The thing was literally welded to his dick, and no amount of pulling was gonna shift it.\n\nNot wanting to spend what few years of his life remained without a schlong, the farmer staggered over to the instruction manual and flipped to the 'help' hotline number. Using his narratively convenient yet anachronistic mobile phone, he rang the manufacturers.\n\n\"'Sup.\" said the manufacturer.\n\n\"Hello,\" said the farmer. \"I've just purchased your new milking machine, and I can't remove it. What the hell do I do?\"\n\n\"Oh, that'll be the automatic locking mechanism. It's there to make sure it doesn't fall off the cow.\"\n\n\"Well, how d'you get it off?\"\n\n\"Easy. *You* don't have to do anything, sir.

We may have to remove the tooth.\"\n\n\"That's horrible doc... Am I gonna be ok?\"\n\n\"Of course you will! Like I said, it's nothing too major, so we just need to pull the tooth, get rid of the abscess, and you'll be as good as new. I'll schedule an appointment for next week to get your tooth extracted. If you feel any worsening pain or think you need medication, come back in and I'll check it out once more!\"\n\n\"Ok! Thanks Doctor!\"\n\nSomewhat upset about this news, George returns home and turns in for the night. The next morning, however, his symptoms started to alter. The pain he was experiencing before was only coming periodically. However, it seemed that anytime a tremor of pain passed through his mouth, George would pass gas. At first, it seemed like a mere coincidence, but as the day went on and his pains came more frequently, George began to notice that he could stop making wind.\n\nConfused about all of this, George falls asleep yet again. Upon waking up, George immediately feels pain on his tooth and, like the day before, cuts the cheese for no reason. However, this time was different. When he farted, it made a strange noise. It almost sounded like his anus was saying \"honda.\"\n\nAs the day went by, his pains started to become more frequent, and so did his farting. However, it became more clear that every time he would fart, it sounded like someone saying \"honda.\" Being utterly confused about all of this, George decides to ask the dentist if everything's ok with him.\n\n\"What seems to be the problem George?\"\n\n\"I don't know doc... Everytime my tooth starts to ache, for some reason, I pass gas for no reason!\"\n\n\"Hmm... that is strange... Is there anything else out of the ordinary?\"\n\n\"There is... You probably won't believe this, but whenever I do break wind, it sounds like my butt is saying \"honda\" in a winded voice. I have no idea what this means doc!\"\n\nJust as George finishes his sentence, he gets the greatest pain in his mouth that he's had since this whole ordeal started. Immediately after, he rips out a horribly loud one right on the chair in the dentist's office. The word \"honda\" shrieked through the whole office as this excruciating pain crossed through George's body.\n\n\"Hmm... It seems this is worse than I originally thought George.

Do you know if I'm going out shopping or have I already returned?\"\n\nThey could tell him that he wasn't away yet, so he went to see if the butcher had any meat today. But the butcher said:\n\n\"Grandpa, you're confused again. We don't have any milk, the butcher without any meat is across the street.\"\n\nSo the grandpa asked around and heard that another butcher had just received a shipment. He went there, but discovered that there was already a line around the block. There was no choice but to stand in line as well.\n\nA few hours later, as the grandpa was almost at the front, the butcher shouted that there is nothing left. The grandpa had enough at this point. He started to yell:\n\n\"I fought in the Revolution under Lenin and again defended our Motherland when Hitler marched in! And yet we poor people have nothing?! This is an outrage!\"\n\nA few soldiers overheard him and pulled him aside.\n\n\"Grandpa, if Stalin would be still alive, we'd shoot you on the spot for your yelling. Just calm down and go home. There's nothing you can do here.\"\n\nThe grandpa grumbles a bit, but agrees to calm down and return home. He safely arrives and his wife sees him returning empty-handed:\n\n\"So, they didn't have any meat today again?\"\n\nHe awnsers:\n\n\"It's gotten even worse.

Austria & Czechoslovakia have wisely switched to using the German Mark & that scares the West. The petro-pound will collapse soon while the Mark will only increase in value.\n\nHow can the West even criticize Germany when Great Britain is ruled by a QUEEN? Whatabout British terrorism, such as World War 1? They overthrew the legitimate leader of Germany, Kaiser Wilhelm II, after killing tens of millions of Native Europeans!\n\nThe 1.5 million panzer-vacationeers held a referendum & the West should respect that. Let the people of Silesia & Danzig choose their Lebensraum. If the Pole minority wants to remain living in Poland, they can ethnically cleanse themselves to it. \n\nThe League of Nations sanction Germany for annexing ancient German land, but what do they say about the British EMPIRE? More like League of ZIONISTS. Read The Protocols of Zion if you don't believe me.\n\n- Beulah McDillycutty, Texas\n \n--------------------------------\n\nThe Polish junta started all of this by attacking Volk just because they spoke German. Prussians are but simple coal miners & truck drivers defending their homeland, while the fascist Polkrops prepare Blitzkrieg. \n\nRemember when Western news claimed invisible U-boats violated their waters & sunk their ships? Allied propaganda lies like this all the time. I trust Himmler & German state press to question more and tell me what is really happening.\n\nThere is no proof the Wehrmacht is invading. The Waffen SS can't control what their Schutzstaffel do on vacation. Those Aryan volunteers & freedom fighters liberated those Panzer IIIs & MP-40s from the Pollock invaders. Wake up, sheeple! Why would Germany want a war on 2 fronts?\n\nHitler personally rebuilt the Wehrmacht because the West seeks to surround them with the Maginot Line. Think about who benefits from global war. This is all part of the international Jew's plan to divide Germany & take its resources.\n\nThe West has always planned to start World War 2 & if they do they will lose because German technology is better.

Feeling incredibly happy with himself, he goes home feeling great.\n\nMeanwhile, the angels watching the priest go back to God once again. \"What was that for!?

Ecstatic from the results, she revisited the midget the next day, and the next, each time boldly rejected with a simply \"No!\" but growing another six inches for her trouble.\n\nNow standing at a proud 5 foot 9, the girl pondered whether she should make one last visit. Her height was now certainly more than adequate, but what she truly longed was to have a grand physique, to be statuesque.

Excited, the man runs home, and immediately gets in bed with his wife.\n\nA year later, he goes to see the doctor - he says 'My wife got pregnant!'\n\n'That's impossible!' says the doctor. 'We treated you! Do you want to have another operation to make sure!'\n\nThe man agrees, goes under for another few hours, and wakes up to feel even more uncomfortable. He then nails his wife again, and comes right back to the doctor's office.\n\n'It's not working!' he shouts\n\nThe doctor replied in disbelief 'Impossible! Your vans deferns are tied off! You literally cannot send sperm through your penis!'\n\n'Look man, I don't know if you're as good a doctor as you say you are, but from what I saw, getting your tubes tied doesn't stop pregnancy, it just darkens the baby's skin colour!'",

His corn, his carrots, his peas...all are either dead or far too blighted to sell. As he strolls through his fields, he sees that a number of his beets are just healthy enough, but still suffering. He gathers them up and puts them in large baskets. He puts the baskets on a cart and heads into town, hoping to sell or trade his blighted beets. On the way to town, the wheel of his cart breaks and he can no longer pull it. He gathers the large baskets in his arms and continues down the road. Once he gets into town, no one will buy his beets from him, saying that they will not buy such ailed vegetables. He begins to worry that he will have no money or food for his family. In that town, there was a guild where many local farmers could sell and trade their goods with ease and better connections. However, these special benefits and connections were only available to members of the guild. The farmer was not a member of the guild, but, in desperation, he picked up his baskets of blighted beets and headed for the guild's meeting hall. On the way there, he tripped and tore large holes in his baskets. He gathered up all his beets in his arms and continued on, taking care not to let any of his cargo slip from his grasp. When he reached the doors of the hall, a large man in a uniform stopped him from entering. \"Are you a member of this club?\" the large man asked. \"No,\" replied the farmer. \"But I simply must sell my beets! The rest of my crops have died and these are the only ones I have left!\" The beets were beginning to feel very heavy and the farmer was not sure if he could hold on to them. \"I'm sorry, but only club members are allowed in,\" said the large man. In desperation, the farmer cried out, \"You gotta let me in the club before I drop these sick beets!\"",

You've got to come see it with your own eyes.\" So the young man picked him up at the airport, and just before they reached the factory a huge billboard loomed up. In huge let- ters, beneath a close-up of Jesus on the cross, it read USE SMITH'S NAILS FOR THE TOUGHEST JOBS. \"Jimmy,\" groaned Mr. Smith, \"that's the new ad campaign? I'm telling you, the public's never gonna go for it.\" \n\nA year later Jimmy informed him that things at the factory were going very well. \"Come on up and check it out, Dad,\" he urged. \"Oh, and by the way, you were right about that ad campaign. We've got a whole new one running now.\" So Mr. Smith flew up again, and on the way in from the airport spotted the same huge billboard.

About a year ago we started talking, and one thing lead to another and now we sneak into the bathroom every morning and bang each other's brains out.\n\nSo when I get to the office, you see, I've got this new lady boss that's really tough on the staff; as soon as she took over she started laying people off left and right. But the thing is she seems to have a sweet spot for me, and started calling me into her office and asking me to perform some pretty awkward tasks until we just started to full-on bang each other, and now I'm scared I'll lose my job if I try to break it off.\n\nSo by lunch time I'm usually pretty tired, but the thing is, there's this really sweet blonde that works at the diner I like to go to, and she's always so nice and cheerful, and always slips me a piece of cake, on the house. It's carrot cake, too, and you see, I like carrot cake, so I thought it'd be kind of rude to tell her no when she started coming on to me. So now every day at lunch time, we have a quickie in alley behind.\"\n\nThe doctor, now unable to hide his irritation, barked:\n\n\"Okay, so what seems to be the problem?\"\n\n\"Well, it hurts when I masturbate.\"",

Surely he thinks , he can license the rights to this joke. Along the way he can't stop thinking of the fortune he's going to make. As he's arrived at the office he storms through the enters doors .\n\"I must speak to your best lawyer, NOW!\" \n\n\nThe receptionist slightly overwhelmed  replies \"Sir , all lawyers are unavailable simply upon request and must be met with through an appointment.\"  \n\"Listen lady\" he says \"Either I meet with a lawyer or you meet my fist\"\n\nThe receptionist now worried, escorts him to the best lawyer they have . \nAs soon as he sees the lawyer he says \"I have joke and it's essential that I patent it.\"\n\"You don't 'patent' a joke\" the lawyer replies , \"you have the right to give someone authority to copy or display your work if you're the author\"\n\nOvercome by this news the man thinks of the best possible way to submit his joke and prove he's the author. Then paranoia kicks in, he's just told a lawyer he about his joke..he has to kill him he think or he'll surely try and steal it. After thinking about it he reasons with himself and decide he can't kill him , it'd cause too many problems.\n\nSo spontaneously he grabs the nearest pen and starts writing on the wall.\n\"Hey!\" The lawyer yells \"What are you doing!\" \nIt's too late , the lawyer began to read  the joke on the wall and started laughing.\n\nThe man smiled and thought to himself that it should keep the lawyer and whoever else in this firm who tries to read it pacified in laughter for a few hours.\n\nThe man rushed to his car and knew where he had to go next. A local news studio. He sped off and arrived at the studio within 20minutes.\nHe looked at his watch and couldn't believe how perfectly it worked out , he had arrived just before the were going to go live.\n\nHe walks up to the door the find that it's locked, angered he begins banging on the door. \nAbout a minute later he's greeted two security guards.\nHe tries to run by them but fails , they grab him by each arm and begin walking away from the building , he has an idea . He'll break them with his joke, he begins to say it when he they throw him to the ground , knocking him unconscious.\n\n\nHe wakes up not knowing how long he was out for, but long enough to assume he missed his chance to hit live television.\n\nHe's not going to let 20 years of his life go to waste, he decides that president Obama needs to hear it. \n\nRacing off once again he is soon greeted by flashing lights. \n\nThe man thinking the receptionist back at the firm must have sent the cop after him , holds on to the joke tightly.\n\nAs the cop steps in front of the mans door , he asks \"Do you have any idea how fast you were going?\"\n\n\"I need to get there.\" Replies the man  \"I know why you're here.\" The man begins to get emotional.\n\n\"Get where?\"\n\n\"To the w-w-hite-house\" says the man with a frog is his throat while thinking of how much a disaster this is and no one will even recognize him as owner of the joke.\n\n\"What's that you've got in your hand? Do you have any Idea how far the whitehouse is sir, it's almost a 5 day drive? Are you on any type of medication at this time?\"\n\nThe man looks up at the officer almost crying \"It's my joke!\" He yells  \"I just don't know anymore ...\" the man cries \" I was going there but now I'm not and now it's just all one big mess..., you've got to help me officer\" he continues to cry \n\n\"I don't know where I'm going with this joke.\"\n",

Of course, she would like everyone involved in the operation to keep the affair highly confidential and asks the doctors and nurses to maintain complete secrecy.\n\nAfter the procedure, she wakes up in the recovery ward and to her utter shock finds 3 huge bouquets of flowers, apparently from well-wishers.\n\n\"Nurse!  Get in here immediately!\" she demands.  The nurse scurries in and asks how she can assist.\n\"I expressly asked that no one know about my surgery!\" she exclaims.  \"Who are all these flowers from?!\"\n\"Oh, sorry\" explains the nurse. \"We were all just so excited to see you here, the team of nurses and doctors just thought it would be nice to offer you some flowers to wish you a speedy recovery.\"\n\"Hmmph.  And what about the other bunch over there!\" she barks as she gestures at the second bouquet.\n\"Oh, that's from Kanye, he also wishes you well and said he'll be here shortly.\"\n\"And what about THAT bunch!\" she says as she motions at the third beautiful arrangement.\n\"Oh, that's from a guy in the burns unit.

        "body": "Jesus Christ himself has called the entire human race to allow them to explain themselves before he ends human existence, and madness ensues - this is like the harvey dent mob trial  x100, there's pandemonium. Jesus calls for order and says humanity must pick one person to represent them all. Everyone writes down their choice on a card.\n\n\nJesus tallies the votes and tells everyone a choice has been made \"Hitler? Adolf Hitler?.... Hitler?\" Jesus has a look of confusion on his face so he pulls out his iPad and quickly scans a page, the audience is in utter shock, people are looking at each other and accusing family of voting for hitler, everyone denying it , fathers beating sons for thinking voting for hitler is a joke, others shouting \"see, jesus uses apple, I knew it\" and for the first time, complete silence from he Android community aftermost of them committed suicide after seeing the Lord's chosen brand.\n\n\n\"ok so your attorney ,hitler,he's dead - thats weird but no problem. looks like he was a great man, the ruler of an entire democracy\" Jesus whistles to show the audience he's impressed with their choice, now everyone is very confused.\n\n\n\"Hitler, what do you say about humanity\" Hitler starts shouting in german and Jesus is nodding, scratching his bears to show his deep contemplation, he suddenly stops hitler mid speech as the bears let out a mighty growl.\n\n\n\"ok hitler well just tell me this, have you done any of the bad sins, like the one about not worshiping those other gods? Now I know my english must be confusing for you. Hitler is still really pissed about a jew interrupting him so all he can shout now is a word Jesus did understand \"Nin, Nin Nin!\"\n\n\n\"Ok, trials over - the verdict is...... Not guilty! You chose a nobel peace prize nominee, that shows bears, Imean.. balls - sometimes it's the guys who almost win who are the real winners - it shows you mean well. Ok I'm out of here!\"\n\n\nThe entire world is relieved, but now more confused than ever. King Obama (he figured the world was coming to an end and changed his title) walks up to the front of the crowd and demands answers. \"Dubya? what the.. I thought I exiled you\"\n\n\n\"Nope, Everyone actually voted for you. Knew they would, but I just assumed jesus might be racist\"\n\n\n\"You rigged this for Hitler to win just because him and Jesus are racist? you thought Jesus would identify with him?\"\n\n\n\"Oh, no that's not what I meant. Well Mr. Obama, Hitler is an incoherent man, he speaks German, you think Christ has time to learn German? Do you think he wants anyone to know that he's not fluent in German?\"\n\n\n\"That's... a terrible assumption George\"\n\n\n\"Sorry, yeah that's not what happened. Force of habit. I know of his wikipedia page, take a look\"\n\n\n\"it says he's a Madman..genocidal - yeah, his wikipedia page isn't very compelling, and it says here the nobel nomination  was a joke. Come on Dubya tell me whats going on I'd tell you if I were in your shoes\"\n\n\n\"okay, now look on my ipad\"\n\n\n\"This thing, it looks all old and has vaseline and residue old lines of coke all over it... eew Gross bro ...it's too old to even display wikipedia properly and it won't play flash.Look at all these porn unclosed porn tabs - you realize we track this stuff right also let me get a bump, just like in my autobiography\"\n \n\n\"Oh I know, i had to the old tablet just for today, those lines are older than your promise to stop doing cocaine and smoking cigarettes but you're licking my ipad clean as we speak as if it was a dog dish or a mcDonalds sunday at the Clinton house. But back to the point - you see, that iPad jesus had, I recognized it, I got one too - it's from Steve Jobs himself - he told me it was no orfinary ipad and I asked him what the fuck is an ipad, everyone will thinkit's a tampon and it will fail I told him - a gift from the only dead man more universally loved than Jesus himself\"\"\n\n\n\"Jesus George, this coke is amazing... but keep explaining - what is the significance of this clearly amazing device?\"\n\n\n\"I never said that was coke. Mr President, Well, that's not a real iPad and like I said it's not real coke - it's an ipad for world leaders, it came out an entire 7 years before the first iPhone was released to you people. I remember the exclusive event, it was fucking amazing, and even Jobs was having a good time,muttering things about moon dust and science, but there were hookers and blow everywhere and they were no ordinary hookers if you catch my drift, that was Tim's idea. I mean I always felt like I got raped at that event but it wasn't until 5 years later that I truly realized. when I couldn't figure out how to create a new electronic message on my secure godaddy email, one of the tech guys said there was a problem with it, something about DNS. Turns out some of the websites you go to are real, but some aren't - he then admitted he's only ever worked at a burger king, I told the kid to cook up a big whopper and put it in the Clinton account, I think they hired him for some odd jobs\"\n\n\n\"wikipedia? you defeated Jesus using wikipedia?\"\n\n\n\"yes Mr. Obama, wikipedia. I ruled the united states for 5 years thinking I had been given a magical iPad that let me see past the web of lies and look uber cool because it was super pre release... of course, this was clearly a gray's almanac situation, I couldn't tell anyone, not even Cheney. Unlike Biff's stolen copy, my almanac was WRONG and I kept trying to double down based on advice from this page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system).\" I had been relying on wikipedia for all of my info,everything from waterboarding https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planking_(fad) to water gate. I used pages like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2001 to refer to official statistics and make big decisions\"\n\n\n\"Okay, this is all starting to make more sense now, so you must have gone to hitler's wikipedia page at some point and saw what was there, and you knew Jesus would see the same. Ok. Ok I think we're good. So I guess Jesus is no better at verifying sources than your average redditor and he never heard of the third reich\"\n\n\n\"I guess not Mr. Obama... haha I guessss not\"\n\n\n\"Why did you say it like that? Fine then, the world will never know you had actually saved it - you're not as bad as I thought. But - tell me one last thing - you knew the ipad was a fake a long time ago\"\n\n\n\"Right, right - that was an embarrassing day - I will never try to learn anything new again, I was techshamed - it's like the male version of being slut shamed. Why are you rubbing it in What's your point?\"\n\n\n\"Well, George... I'm not one to Judge, but - if you knew it was fake, and you could read the real wikipedia on any other computer - then why... you know, why do you still deny.. I mean why deny all that awful stuff\"\n\n\n\"You mean.. why did I continue to stand by the 'mission accomplished banner' - actually it was supposed to be ironic, didn't know the media would be there'\n\n\n\"no... no, anyone could have made that mistake - I mean the holocaust\"",

There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.\n\nHe stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out\nand he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.\n\nHe thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon\nhow dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So,\nhe puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication\nlater, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give\nhim a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle\nin case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the\ndirection he thinks is right.\n\nHe walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's\nbeen sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and\nwhether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.\n\nHe pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.\n\nBy the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the\ntown. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.\n\nAs it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things,\nhe finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.\n\nFull dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back\nup and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.\n\nHe wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.\n\nHe knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.\n\nHe rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in\nhis mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't\nfind water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.\n\nThen he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.\n\nLooking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.\n\nAs he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.\n\nHe decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait\nany longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large\nrock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly\nswallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry\nand cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes\nanother mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle.\nHe figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to\nmake some difference and keep himself from passing out.\n\nHe's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him,\nit kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty\nsure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.\n\nHe walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills,\ndunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water.\nSometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.\n\nAfter a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat\nstroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.\n\nAfter more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He\nknows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing\ndonuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy\nenough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if\nhe's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it,\ntrying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.\n\nHe was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.\n\nHe walks through the sand.\n\nAfter a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't\nremember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he\ndoesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.\n\nBut, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures\nthat he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from\nthere that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.\n\nHalfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third\ntime, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll\njust fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.\n\nWhile crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally\ngotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through\nthe sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert\nin the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any\nrips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape -\nshake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.\n\nHe finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top,\nhe struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees\nis sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he\nsees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more\ndunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.\n\nAgain, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper\nfluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the\ncap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from\nhere. He's going to have to go down there and look.\n\nHe puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune.\nAfter a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.\n\nHe stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough\nenergy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When\nhe clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot\nin the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.\n\nSo, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins\nto crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to\nhave the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages\nof dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't\nhave water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last\nchance.\n\nHe gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the\ndark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting\nhis head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just\nkeeps crawling.\n\nFinally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center,\nwhere his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone\narea.\n\nHis mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark\nstone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun\noverhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying\ndown on the nice cool surface.\n\nCool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's\nprobably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and\ndying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the\nbeautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him\na drink. Then he'll know he's gone.\n\nHe decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here\nin the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the\ncenter before he goes. He keeps crawling.\n\nIt's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's\nhearing. He would swear that someone just said, \"Greetings, traveler. You do\nnot look well. Do you hear me?\"\n\nHe stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and\nknees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something\ndifferent - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few\nseconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and\ntries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands\nand tries again. Better this time.\n\nYep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse\nof stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or\npole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet\nout of the stone, at an angle.\n\nAnd wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and\nseeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long\ndesert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.\n\nHe stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and\nrun away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his\nfinal resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to\nmove from this spot.\n\nWell, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than\ndying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a\nlittle straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves\nit in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a\nmoment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.\n\nHmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet -\nthat was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.\n\nHe then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here\nbecause he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was\nlikely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was\nnow on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had\nactually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white\npost sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe\nthey were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake\nwas even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.\n\nHe tries to clear his throat to say, \"Hello,\" but his throat is too dry. All\nthat comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going\nto be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the\nbottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out,\nalmost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't\ngood. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes\nout.\n\nHe gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips,\nand pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then\nswallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk\nnow.\n\nHe tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to\nspot the owner of this place, and croaks out, \"Hello? Is there anyone here?\"\n\nHe hears, from his side, \"Greetings. What is it that you want?\"\n\nHe turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed\nto come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a\nspeaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides\nto try asking for help.\n\n\"Please,\" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, \"I'd love to not be\nthirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?\"\n\nLooking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was\ncoming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its\nmouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he\nfalls forward, face first on the stone, \"Very well. Coming up.\"\n\nA piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits\nup and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily\ndisoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the\nsand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped\naround the tilted white post, still looking at him.\n\nHe reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet.\nHe pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder\nagain - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes -\nthey match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been\nbitten. By the snake.\n\n\"It'll feel better in a minute.\" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He\nhadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more\nimportantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!\n\n\"Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the\nafterlife?\"\n\n\"Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,\" says the snake. \"That's the way I\nwork. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.\"\n\n\"You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a\ndrink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be\nthirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for\nthe windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk?\nAre you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?\"\n\n\"No,\" says the snake, \"I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I\ndidn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I\nbite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just\nsitting around here.\"\n\nThe man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the\ndesert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a\nsnake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not\ngreat - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no\nlonger thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt\nhot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool\nstone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer\ndying of thirst.\n\n\"I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your\nsystem with the next request,\" continued the snake. \"I can guess why you\ndrank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left\nin the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or\ntwo, if you drank enough of it.\"\n\n\"Ummm, n-next request?\" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting\nshoulder and backed away from the snake a little.\n\n\"That's the way it works. If you like, that is,\" explained the snake. \"You\nget three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish.\" The snake grinned at his\nown joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.\n\n\"But there are rules,\" the snake continued. \"The first request is free. The\nsecond requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of\nresponsibility.\" The snake looks at the man seriously.\n\n\"By the way,\" the snake says suddenly, \"my name is Nathan. Old Nathan,\nSamuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound\nused to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand\nfor it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into\nnames. You can call me Nate, if you wish.\" Again, the snake grinned. \"Sorry\nif I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds\nsomewhat threatening.\" The snake give his rattle a little shake.\n\n\"Umm, my name is Jack,\" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. \"Jack\nSamson.\n\n\"Can I ask you a question?\" Jack says suddenly. \"What happened to the\npoison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that?\nWhat do you mean by that's how you work?\"\n\n\"That's more than one question,\" grins Nate. \"But I'll still try to answer\nall of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question.\" The snake's grin gets\nwider. \"Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need\nto drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not\nbe thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make\nit permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at\nall. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to\nget enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert.\nYou've been changed.\n\n\"For the third question,\" Nate continues, \"you are still dying. Besides the\neffects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal.\nIn your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years.\nAssuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is.\" Nate seemed vastly\namused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.\n\n\"As for the fourth question,\" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack\ncould tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read\ntalking-snake emotions from snake facial features, \"first you have to agree\nto make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell\nyou.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" joked Jack, \"isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd\nhave to kill me?\"\n\n\"I thought that was implied.\" Nate continued to look serious.\n\n\"Ummm...yeah.\" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was\ntalking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a\nnasty temper. \"So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really\nstop the effects of the methanol?\" Jack thought for a second. \"And, what do\nyou mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper\nfluid, and just denature it?\"\n\n\"They may, I don't really know,\" said Nate. \"I haven't gotten out in a\nwhile. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and\non that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you\npulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume\nthat they still color wiper fluid blue?\"\n\n\"Yeah, they do,\" said Jack.\n\n\"I figured,\" replied Nate. \"As for being bound by secrecy - with the\nfulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me,\nthis place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you\ndecide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me,\nwrite about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will\nlead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of\ncourse, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm\nguessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding\nanyway, so you won't notice.\" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.\n\nJack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a\nlittle nervous at this. \"Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know\nthat? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?\"\n\nWell, Jack,\" said Nate sadly, \"I can't tell you that, unless you make the\nsecond request.\" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.\n\n\"Umm, well, ok,\" said Jack, \"what is this about a second request? What can I\nask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?\"\n\n\"Sure!\" said Nate, brightening. \"You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes\nto yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and\nbefore you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or\nomnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous\nand yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and\nsort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be\nomniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very\nuseful, at least in my opinion.\" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was\nstaring at him.\n\n\"Well, anyway,\" continued Nate, \"I'd probably suggest giving you permanent\ngood health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be\nimmune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long\ntime, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to\nrecover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a\nrequest to me.\"\n\n\"Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?\" said Jack. \"And keep me healthy for a\nlong time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request\nabout a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not\nreally a change to me?\"\n\n\"Right,\" nodded Nate.\n\n\"Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?\" Jack asked, hopefully.\n\n\"That takes two requests, Jack.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I figured so,\" said Jack. \"But I could ask to be a genius? I could\nbecome the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?\"\n\n\"Well, I could make you very smart,\" admitted Nate, \"but that wouldn't\nnecessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you\nvery athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either.\nYou've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some\ntruth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It\nall depends on what you decide to do with it.\"\n\n\"Hmmm,\" said Jack. \"Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request,\nafter this one?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Nate, \"it depends on what you decide then. There are more\nrules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second\nrequest. You know how it goes.\" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had\nshoulders.\n\n\"Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent\nhealth doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially.\nDo I need to sign in blood or something?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Nate. \"Just hold out your hand. Or heel.\" Nate grinned. \"Or\nwhatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said,\nthat's how it works - the poison, you know,\" Nate said apologetically.\n\nJack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it\ndidn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better\nabout the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot\nsnake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to\nbe able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack\ntried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it\nwouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.\n\n\"Hey, Jack,\" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind\nhim, \"is that someone else coming up over there?\"\n\nJack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of\nnowhere? And did they bring food?\n\nWait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...\n\nJack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through\nhis jeans...\n\nJack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. \"I would have\ndecided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to\nhoodwink me like that.\"\n\n\"I've been doing this a long time, Jack,\" said Nate, confidently. \"You\nhumans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you -\nespecially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of\nminutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the\nhealth benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, still,\" said Jack, \"it's the principle of the thing. And nobody\nlikes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or\nsomething instead?\"\n\n\"More meat in the typical human butt,\" replied Nate. \"And less chance you\naccidentally kick me or move at the last second.\"\n\n\"Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify\nto hear,\" answered Jack.\n\n\"Ok,\" said Nate. \"Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to\njust start talking?\"\n\n\"Just talk,\" said Jack. \"I'll sit here and try to not think about food.\"\n\n\"We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,\"\nanswered Nate.\n\n\"Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!\" Jack jumped up.\n\"What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically\nwhip up food along with your other powers?\" Jack was almost shouting with\nexcitement. His stomach had been growling for hours.\n\n\"I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite\nit for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife,\nthat is,\" replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to.\n\n\"Ugh,\" said Jack, sitting back down. \"I think I'll pass. I can last a little\nlonger before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it\nis you find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw.\nNo thanks. Just talk.\"\n\n\"Ok,\" replied Nate, still grinning. \"But I'd better hurry, before you start\nlooking at me as food.\n\nNate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued.\n\"You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden.\"\n\nJack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate\nsceptically.\n\n\"Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack,\" said Nate. \"Stand up\nand look at the symbol on the rock here.\" Nate gestured around the dark\nstone they were both sitting on with his nose.\n\nJack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a\nrepresentation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around\nwas coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches\nleft the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it\nlooked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and\nembedded in the stone than it did like a carving.\n\nJack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the\nsetting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the\nsky.\n\nWait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another\nnight out here! Arrrgh!\n\nJack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and\nstood next to Nate. \"In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate,\" said\nJack. \"Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to\nhave to head back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw\ndesert critters for long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to.\"\n\n\"It's about 30 miles that way.\" Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail\nthis time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to\nthe way he'd been going when he was crawling here. \"But that's 30 miles by\nthe way the crow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be\nable to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head\nout early tomorrow, Jack.\"\n\nJack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and\nthen sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading\nout right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting\nstuff. \"Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway,\" said Nate. \"He\nfigured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a\n'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he\ncould never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from\nacross the ocean. He worried about that for a while.\"\n\n\"Garden of Eden, hunh?\" said Jack. \"How long have you been here, Nate?\"\n\n\"No idea, really,\" replied Nate. \"A long time. It never occurred to me to\ncount years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I\ndo remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands\nof years, at least.\"\n\n\"So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?\" said Jack.\n\n\"Beats me,\" said Nate. \"Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your\nkind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it\ncould have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant\nrequests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals.\"\n\n\"Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out\nof the stone there?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much\nbigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember\nif it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But\none day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do\nsomething for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've\nbeen here ever since.\n\n\"What is this place?\" said Jack. \"And what did he ask you to do?\"\n\n\"Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?\" Nate loosened his\ncoils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into\nthe stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to\nenter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned\nover and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as\nJack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but\nNate was suddenly there in the way.\n\n\"You can't touch that yet, Jack,\" said Nate.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I haven't explained it to you yet,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something,\" said Jack. \"You'd push it\nthat way, and it would move in the slot.\"\n\n\"Yep, that's what it is,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"What does it do?\" asked Jack. \"End the world?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Nate. \"Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it\n'The Lever of Doom'.\" For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing\nvoice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and\ngrinned.\n\nJack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned\nJack laughed. \"Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it\nreally do?\"\n\n\"Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said,\" smirked Nate. \"I just thought\nthe voice I used was funny, didn't you?\"\n\nNate continued to grin.\n\n\"A lever to end humanity?\" asked Jack. \"What in the world is that for? Why\nwould anyone need to end humanity?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Nate, \"I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment.\nOr maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really\nbad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are\nthe rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I\ndidn't think to ask back when I started here.\"\n\n\"Rules? What rules?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it\nunless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human\ncan be bound in that way at a time. That's it.\" explained Nate.\n\nJack looked somewhat shocked. \"You mean that I could pull the lever now?\nYou'd let me end humanity?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate, \"if you want to.\" Nate looked at Jack carefully. \"Do\nyou want to, Jack?\"\n\n\"Umm, no.\" said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. \"Why in\nthe world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want\nthat! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too,\nwouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate, \"being as he'd be human too.\"\n\n\"Has anyone ever seriously considered it?\" asked Nate. \"Any of those bound\nto secrecy, that is?\"\n\n\"Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or\nanother. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and\nthink, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get\ndisgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while.\nBut he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here.\" Nate grinned some more.\n\nJack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at\nthe same time. After a bit, he said, \"So this makes me the Judge of\nhumanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?\"\n\n\"That seems to be it,\" agreed Nate.\n\n\"What kind of criteria do I use to decide?\" said Jack. \"How do I make this\ndecision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are\nbad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" replied Nate. \"You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's\nup to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed\nto know.\"\n\n\"But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel\nhorrible? Couldn't I make a mistake? How do I know that I won't screw up?\"\nprotested Jack.\n\nNate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. \"You don't. You just have to\ntry your best, Jack.\"\n\nJack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly\ngetting dark, chewing on a fingernail.\n\nSuddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. \"Nate, was Samuel the\none bound to this before me?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate. \"He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to\nread and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried\nin the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months\nago.\"\n\n\"Sounds like a good guy,\" agreed Jack. \"How did he handle this, when you\nfirst told him. What did he do?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Nate, \"he sat down for a while, thought about it for a bit, and\nthen asked me some questions, much like you're doing.\"\n\n\"What did he ask you, if you're allowed to tell me?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"He asked me about the third request,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"Aha!\" It was Jack's turn to grin. \"And what did you tell him?\"\n\n\"I told him the rules for the third request. That to get the third request\nyou have to agree to this whole thing. That if it ever comes to the point\nthat you really think that humanity should be ended, that you'll come here\nand end it. You won't avoid it, and you won't wimp out.\" Nate looked serious\nagain. \"And you'll be bound to do it too, Jack.\"\n\n\"Hmmm.\" Jack looked back out into the darkness for a while.\n\nNate watched him, waiting.\n\n\"Nate,\" continued Jack, quietly, eventually. \"What did Samuel ask for with\nhis third request?\"\n\nNate sounded like he was grinning again as he replied, also quietly,\n\"Wisdom, Jack. He asked for wisdom. As much as I could give him.\"\n\n\"Ok,\" said Jack, suddenly, standing up and facing away from Nate, \"give it\nto me.\n\nNate looked at Jack's backside. \"Give you what, Jack?\"\n\n\"Give me that wisdom. The same stuff that Samuel asked for. If it helped\nhim, maybe it'll help me too.\" Jack turned his head to look back over his\nshoulder at Nate. \"It did help him, right?\"\n\n\"He said it did,\" replied Nate. \"But he seemed a little quieter afterward.\nLike he had a lot to think about.\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, I can see that,\" said Jack. \"So, give it to me.\" Jack turned to\nface away from Nate again, bent over slightly and tensed up.\n\nNate watched Jack tense up with a little exasperation. If he bit Jack now,\nJack would likely jump out of his skin and maybe hurt them both.\n\n\"You remember that you'll be bound to destroy humanity if it ever looks like\nit needs it, right Jack?\" asked Nate, shifting position.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, I got that,\" replied Jack, eyes squeezed tightly shut and body\ntense, not noticing the change in direction of Nate's voice.\n\n\"And,\" continued Nate, from his new position, \"do you remember that you'll\nturn bright purple, and grow big horns and extra eyes?\"\n\nContinued in Comments.",

That's how I'll be able to tell your exact age!\"\n\nThe woman looks around. The street is entirely empty and she's really curious about the old man's answer, so she says:\n\n\"What the hell, go for it!\"\n\nThe old man puts both hands under the woman's blouse and grabs her breasts. He squeezes softly. After a few minutes, the woman loses her patience and says:\n\n\"Soooo? Can you tell how old I am?\"\n\n\"Of course. You're exactly 47.\"\n\n\"Unbelievable!

You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then Los Angeles and eventually New York where you will run your ever-expanding enterprise.\u201d The Mexican fisherman asked, \u201cBut, how long will this all take?\u201d To which the American replied, \u201c15 to 20 years.\u201d \u201cBut what then?\u201d asked the Mexican. The American laughed and said that\u2019s the best part. \u201cWhen the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions.\u201d \u201cMillions?\u2026Then what?\u201d The American said, \u201cThen you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siesta with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.\u201d",

Upon, further inspection, however, the man notices that the condor is unusually thin.  Sickly, even.\n\nMore than a little troubled, the man gets the shopkeeper's attention and asks him about the bird.  \"What's wrong with your bird?  It looks like she hasn't eaten in weeks.  Don't you feed your animals?\"\n\nThe shopkeeper sighs and shakes his head.  \"That one's a special case,\" he says.  \"We've tried giving her all different kinds of bird feed, but she just won't eat.  It's like she has a compulsion to stay skinny or something.\"\n\n\"Like anorexia?\" asks the man.\n\n\"Yeah, I guess you could call it that,\" the shopkeeper says.  \"At this rate, she's gonna be gone in a couple weeks.\"\n\nThe man gasps in horror.  \"I can't let that happen!\" he exclaims.  \"Let me take her off your hands, I beg you.\"\n\nThe shopkeeper shrugs, undoes the cage and hands him the condor.  \"If you want her, she's yours.  But it's going to be hard to get her to eat.  God knows I couldn't do it.\"\n\nThe man thanks the shopkeeper, pays him and leaves.  As he's driving home, he struggles to process what he just heard.  *An anorexic bird?  Who ever heard of such a thing?*\n\nFor the next few days, the man stops at every single pet shop in the city in search of anything that his condor would eat.  He samples every variety of bird feed in every store, but the condor refuses to touch any of them.  After a few days, he starts to lose hope that he can ever save the bird.\n\nOne day, he comes home with a takeout box from his favorite Dim Sum restaurant.  \"I suppose she won't want any of *this* food, either,\" he mutters to himself.\n\nBut as he's at the dinner table eating, he notices the condor eying his meal hungrily.  The man's face immediately lights up.\n\n*What could she be hungry for, I wonder?*\n\nHe offers her some of the lo ma gai, but she turns her heard away.  He tries a spring roll, next, but she rejects this as well.  But when he presents her a steaming pork bun, she tears into it savagely.\n\n\"I've found it!\" the man cries.  \"Hallelujah, I've found it!\"\n\nFrom then on, the man would take his condor to the Dim Sum restaurant once or twice a week, and order an extra serving of pork buns for her.  Unfortunately, it would be a while before she would start looking healthy again, but the man was content knowing that he had found a way to feed her.\n\nThen, one night at Dim Sum, the man finds that, to his horror, the restaurant has taken pork buns off the menu.\n\n\"But why?!\" he demands.\n\nThe waitress shrugs.  \"The manager decided that they weren't selling well enough,\" he says.  \"But there are plenty of other delicious dishes on our menu.\"\n\n\"You don't understand!\" cries the man.  \"My condor is anorexic!  Those pork buns were the only thing I could get her to eat!\"\n\nThe waitress eyes him skeptically.  \"That's preposterous,\" she says.  \"I'm sure there's something else on the menu that your bird will eat.\"\n\n\"You're welcome to try,\" the man says forlornly.  \"Don't say I didn't warn you.\"\n\nFor the next hour, the waitress runs back and forth between the kitchen and the dining area, bringing out dish after dish after dish.  Spring rolls, spare ribs, fried rice, fried squid, taro cake... but the condor refuses every one.\n\nAfter a while, the man orders her to stop.  \"It's no use, miss,\" he sighs.\n\n\"My ana condor don't want none unless you got buns, hon.\"",

Between them and the gates stands St. Peter. St. Peter tells the three men \"Sorry boys, but it seems heaven is getting jam-packed. To let you in, you have to beat me intellectually, either through a form of a question or a challenge.\"\n\nThe first to come forward is the Physicist, and he tells St. Peter with great confidence \"Show me the entire mathematical markup of the Higgs Boson.\" To which St. Peter merely snaps his finger and produces a dozen large whiteboards and proceeds to write up the whole markup from memory. After careful examination, the Physicist reluctantly agrees that he is correct, and with one snap of the finger, St. Peter sends him to the fiery gates of hell.\n\nThe next to come forward is the Philosopher. Thinking that the Physicist made a grave mistake of challenging St. Peter with an empirical question, he decides to give a less-than-empirical challenge of his own. He tells St. Peter \"Show me all of the works of Socrates.\" he says with a smirk, knowing Socrates never wrote down his teachings, St. Peter would be hard pressed on producing an answer. But despite this, St. Peter produces a stack of papers, and the Philosopher reads it with great criticism. There are things there he had never even heard of, and questioned the paper's authenticity, to which St. Peter remarked \"Me and Socrates have chatted a lot ever since he got here.\" And with a snap of a finger, the Philosopher was gone.\n\nLast to come forward is the Local town idiot. The idiot asks St. Peter, \"Could I give you a riddle instead?\" and St. Peter replies \"Of course! I love riddles!\" and the idiot proceeds. \"What comes up a hill with six legs and comes down with four, comes back up with two legs and back down with no more?\"\n\nSt. Peter ponders on it for a good five minutes and arrives at no answer, and tells the idiot \"Well, congratulations, you have left me dumbfounded.\" and with a snap of a finger, the gates of heaven opens up. The idiot proceeds to enter heaven, but right before he does so, he feels St. Peter tapping on his shoulder, he turns around. \"So,\" St. Peter asks \"What's the answer to your riddle?\"\n\nThe Idiot just shrugs his shoulders and says \"How the hell should I know?\"",

One of the Pigs asks, \"Little Red what are you doing in the Woods so late at night?\"\n\nRed responds, \"I'm taking this basket of goodies to my ill grandmother.\"\n\nPig says, \"But, it's late, and the Big Bad Wolf is about!

She then shuts the door behind her and gasps, \"My Grandmother, you're not looking well at all!\"\n\nAll of a sudden the Big Bad Wolf pops out of the bed and exclaims, \"HA!

After much prayer and consideration they determined the squirrels were predestined to be there and they shouldn't interfere with God's divine will.\n\nAt the Baptist church the squirrels had taken an interest in the baptistery. The deacons met and decided to put a water slide on the baptistery and let the squirrels drown themselves. The squirrels liked the slide and, unfortunately, knew instinctively how to swim so twice as many squirrels showed up the following week.\n\nThe Methodist church decided that they were not in a position to harm any of God's creatures. So, they humanely trapped their squirrels and set them free near the Baptist Church. Two weeks later the squirrels were back when the Baptists took down the water slide.\n\nBut the Catholic Church came up with a very creative strategy. They baptized all the squirrels and consecrated them as members of the church. Now they only see them on Christmas and Easter.\n\nNot much was heard from the Jewish synagogue, but it's rumored that they took one squirrel and circumcised him.

What are those?\" \"Cojones\", the waiter answers, \"are the testicles of the bull that lost in the arena today!\"\n\nAlthough he is a little hesitant at first, the man overcomes his doubt about the dish and tries the cojones. \"These are magnificent!\" he exclaims to the waiter, and finishes the plate with delight.\n\nA week later, towards the end of his vacation, the man revisits the restaurant with fond memories of eating cojones. The waiter comes over, and the man orders the house specialty once again. The waiter returns to his table soon after with a mound of rice pilaf, a green salad, and two small meaty objects.\n\nThe man samples these 'cojones', and finds them to be very bitter and rubbery. Angry, he calls the waiter over. \"What are these?\"\n\n\"Cojones\", the waiter replies. \"But these can't be cojones, I was here last week and they were much bigger and more full of flavour!\"\n\n\"Ah, senor\", the waiter replies, \"the bull does not lose every time.\"",

By the end of the night the bar is full of people watching this amazing duck, still dancing and giving the odd quack now and again. The barman realizes that he hasn't had business this good in a long  time. It is so good that he offers to buy the duck from the man to which the man agrees to sell for 500 pounds. The barman thinks it is a bit expensive but agrees to buy it anyhow. On selling the duck, the man goes home leaving a crowded pub watching his dancing duck. At the end of the night the barman is locking up and the duck is still dancing. The barman thinks oh well time for bed the duck will stop dancing when he wants and the barman goes to bed. \n\nIn the morning the barman comes down to open up to see the duck still dancing away on the biscuit tin. The barman thinks to himself, he must really like dancing I'll leave him be. People flock far and wide to look at this dancing duck and with that buying drinks. Throughout the day the barman has taken more money then he normally takes in a whole month. The barman is just locking up at the end of the night and the duck is still dancing away. The barman is concerned that his 'investment' might wear himself out as he's been dancing for the past 24 hours.\n\n Later that night, the man gets a telephone call; it is the barman  and he exclaims that the duck is a great success and that he has never taking so much money in the last 24 hours, but he says -  \"There is one thing... How do you get the duck to stop dancing?\"  to which the man replies -- \"Oh simple - just take the lid of the  biscuit box and blow out the candle.\"",

Their just ain't enuf Buttsex in Mexico. And we just dont know why it is happening. They are climbing on top of our butts, sawing our pants off, drilling us in the butt, diggin their borritos in our buttholes, then finishing us off with good old fashion sledge hammers. Now their taking our Buttsex oppurnunities and people are having a hard time finding good Buttsexes. The Buttsex gap is increasing on top of that. But If we can find the answer to why Buttsex happens to people maybe we can solve this nation wide epidemic. ",

He cleaned the cat's litter box and bathed the dog. By then it was already 1:00 pm, so he hurried to make the beds, do\nthe laundry, vacuum, dust, and sweep and mop the kitchen floor.\n\nHe rushed to the school to pick up the kids and got into an argument with them on the way home which he had to sort out in a gentle 'motherly' fashion. He set out cookies and milk and got the kids organized to do their homework, then set up the ironing board and was\nable to watch a bit of TV while he did the ironing. By then it was 4:30 pm, so he began peeling potatoes and washed greens for salads. He prepared the chops and fresh vegetables and got everything ready in time for an early dinner.\n\nAfter supper, he cleaned the kitchen, ran the dishwasher, folded laundry, bathed the kids, and put them to bed. At 9:00 pm he was exhausted and although his chores weren't finished for the day, he went to bed where he was expected to make love, which he managed to get through without complaining.

There was a virtual sex session in progress and by the look on my friends face it seemed like it was about to cum to a conclusion but unfortunately; if I may say it again the timing was impeccable, the next half an hour while I was getting ready to leave he was in denial and couldn't believe that I had got him jerking off because he likes to think of himself as a ladies man, and he started hurling random talk with me and looked me deeply in my eyes to see the slightest clue as to what I had witnessed but NO, I am strong I didn't give it away for a second and I think he thinks that I'm stupid but I am also writing this.",

But mind the parrot. **Do NOT** talk to the parrot.\n\nWhen the repairman arrived, he saw biggest, most intimidating dog he'd ever seen. But the dog never approached him, just like the lady said. \n\nThe parrot was another story. The parrot screeched profanities at him and repeatedly called him a \"horse-shit snorting faggot\" with a \"tiny-ass dick\". The man briefly wondered whether the lady taught the parrot those phrases specifically. The repairman was a very patient man. But soon enough he lost his temper and yelled at the bird, \"Shut the hell up!\"\n\nTo which the parrot responded, \"Fetch the balls, Butch!\"",

The sign says \"moderated, any offense will not be tolerated\" along with a list of strict rules demanding that you show respect and sensitivity or else you will be thrown out of the bar. He goes in, sits down and orders a drink. The bartender brings him his drink. He's really down and frustrated but hopes that some drinking will cheer him up. So he starts drinking.\n\nAs he drinks he gets a bit relaxed and notices an odd thing. The bar is FULL of people of different ages. You have kids, teens, young adults, middle aged and all other ages around. Then there are also people from different races. Lots of races. In fact some of which he doesn't even recognize (aliens?). Amazed at this cultural diversity he figures that the group, as a whole, might be quite knowledgeable. If only he could just share some of his troubles with them maybe their collective wisdom could help solve his problems and ease-up his life.\n\nSo he starts pouring out his thoughts, and troubles to people around. And as he speaks it starts a discussion with the people around him.\n\nHe starts, **\"I woke up early today... because today was going to be a very special day.. You see I fucking love bacon and I-\"**\n\n\"I fucking LOVE bacon!\" echoes the guy sitting next to him loudly. \n\nAt this the woman in the next table shouts \"You know why I went to the kitchen today? Because I fucking love BACON (BAKING)\".\n\nHer husband immediately shouts \"oh I love your baking, Frankenswine\".\n\nA guy from the opposite corner chimes-in \"This is why I bring home the bacon!\". And by this time people have randomly begun to join in - each shouting something or the other.\n\n\"I love you too HAMLET\"\n\n\"Watch out she's a PIGpocket\"\n\n\"Waiter! I would like to order a really Jurassic PORK\"\n\n\"Guys! guys! Let's not HAM Bush this pooor man. He was saying something! Let's hear him out!\"\n\nSilence. Our man is surprised and annoyed by this sudden rude outburst but decides to ignore it and give it another go. This time he decides to skip the topic of bacon altogether and starts with a different one. By this time about half of the people around ignore him and go busy into their own work.\n\n**\u201cI was speaking to my mama today who really hates chocolate flavor. You see my papa has a chocolate factory and my mama is now cheating on my papa. And I don\u2019t think that-\u201d** Interrupted.\n\n*Slow clap*\n\n\u201cAm I the only one here to think there's nothing wrong in hating chocolates?\u201d shouts a guy right next to his ear.

By this time another remaining half of the people have stopped listening to him. He shouts loudly at the top of his lungs, **\u201cFUCK!

Tony decided that this was a small price to pay for an eternity in heaven. So off he went with this enormous woman, pretending to be happy.\n\nAs he was walking along, he saw his friend Carlos up ahead. Carlos was with an even bigger, uglier woman than he was with.

Carlos replied, \"I cheated on my income taxes and scammed the government out of a lot of money... even more than you did.\" They both shook their heads and figured that, as long as they have to be with these women, they might as well hang out together to help pass the time.\n\nNow Tony, Carlos and their two beastly women were walking along one day, minding their own business when Tony and Carlos could have sworn they saw their friend John up ahead, only this man was with an absolutely drop dead gorgeous supermodel-centerfold woman. Stunned, Tony and Carlos approached the man and in fact, it was their friend John. They asked him how is it that he is with this unbelievable goddess, while they were stuck with these digustingly awful women. \n\nJohn replied, \"I have no idea and I'm definitely not complaining.

They really hit it off when the man asked the woman a question: will you marry me. \nThe woman thought about it for a while and agreed to marry him under one condition: he had to stop living tractors.\nThe man contemplated, processed, thought, calculated and finally agreed to do it.\n\nLater, the two of the got happily married.

The woman and the children all ran out of the house and the fore brigade was called.\nWhen the fire department arrived, they tried all they would to put out the fire but to no avail.\nAt this point, the man returned home to see his house on fire.

Brother Philippe says \"of course\" and gives him the highest room in the tallest tower. \nBut this year Brother Philippe is prepared and at 11.45 he walks up the stairs to the room with the stranger.

She wrote a letter to a particular campground and asked for reservations. She wanted to make sure the campground was fully equipped but didn\u2019t know quite how to ask about the \u201ctoilet\u201d facilities. She just couldn\u2019t bring herself to write the word \u201ctoilet\u201d in her letter. After much deliberation, she finally came up with the old fashioned term \u201cBathroom Commode,\u201d but when she wrote that down, she still thought she was being too forward. So she started all over again; rewrote the entire letter and referred to the \u201cBathroom Commode\u201d simply as the \u201cB.C.\u201d. Does the campground have its own \u201cB.C.?\u201d is what she actually wrote.\n\nWell, the campground owner wasn\u2019t old fashioned at all, and when he got the letter, he couldn\u2019t figure out what the lady was talking about. That \u201cB.C.\u201d really stumped him. After worrying about it for several days, he showed the letter to other campers, but they couldn\u2019t figure out what the lady meant either. The campground owner finally came to the conclusion that the lady was and must be asking about the location of the local Baptist Church.\n\nSo he sat down and wrote the following reply:\n\n\u201cDear Madam: I regret very much the delay in answering your letter, but I now take pleasure of informing in that the \u201cB.C.\u201d is located nine miles north of the camp site and is capable of seating 250 people at one time. I admit it is quite a distance away if you are in the habit of going regularly but no doubt you will be pleased to know that a great number of people take their lunches along, and make a day of it..... They usually arrive early and stay late. The last time my wife and I went was six years ago, and it was so crowded we had to stand up the whole time we were there. It may interest you to know that right now, there is a supper planned to raise money to buy more seats.....They plan to hold the supper in the middle of the \u201cB.C.\u201d, so everyone can watch and talk about this great event.....I would like to say it pains me very much, not to be able to go more regularly, but it is surely not for lack of desire on my part....As we grow older, it seems to be more and more of an effort, particularly in cold weather..... If you decide to come down to the campground, perhaps I could go with you the first time you go...sit with you...and introduce you to all the other folks..... This is really a very friendly community....",

He gives them each a duck and tells them that the one who gets the most for his duck will be given everything the old man owns. The first son goes out, and when he comes back he says, \"Father! Father! I got $10 for my duck!\" \n\nHis father says, \"That is very good let's see how your other brothers do.\" \n\nAbout a day later the second brother comes home and he says, \"Father! Father! I got $15 for my duck.\" \n\nThe old man replies, \"So far you have done the best, but let's wait and see what your little brother does.\" \n\nWhile the last brother was looking for someone to buy his duck, he happened to pass by a bar. When he got into the bar he saw the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen before, so he told her, \"I'll give you this duck for a fuck.\" \n\nShe replied, \"Ok.\" \n\nWhen the boy got home to his father, his father was so furious that he yelled, \"You get your ass back in that bar and get that duck back!\" \n\nSo the boy returned to the bar and found the same girl and told her his tale. He then said, \"I'll give you a fuck for that duck.\" She agreed and while they were fucking the duck flew out the window and got hit by a truck. \n\nThe truck driver was so sorry about what had happened that he offered to pay for the duck. The boy then replied, \"$20 would do nicely.\" \n\n\"No problem,\" said the driver. When the boy got home he was beaming with pride. He shouted, \"I won! I won! I got a fuck for a duck a duck for a fuck and twenty bucks for a fucked up duck.\" \n\n",

As a result, Jim and Steve would often race around the ranch, typically from one tree to another, desperately trying to best each other.  Their favorite race was from the Chestnut Oak, around the Bitternut Hickory, and back to the Chestnut Oak\n\nDay after day they would run this race, but it was always such a close race that they could never decide who was faster and the ultimate winner.  After several months, a crow named Wilmer took notice.\n\n\"Hey boys,\" Wilmer said, \"you're both incredibly fast.  But I've noticed that you're having trouble starting together and determining the winner.  Tell you what, for a small portion of your feed every day, I would be happy to start your races and also determine the winner.  I've got a sharp eye and quick wits, so all I need to do is sit here on this Chestnut Oak and determine the winner.\n\nElated, the colts agree and take their first race with Wilmer as the judge.\n\n\"Tie!\" exclaims Wilmer.\n\n\"WHAT??\" yell Jim and Steve, \"What are we paying you for?\"\n\n\"Trust me,\" says Wilmer.  \"My eyes are the sharpest in all the land and that was most certainly a tie.\"\n\n\"Well shoot, I guess we'll race again.\"\n\nThis went on for years and years, tie after tie after tie.  Eventually Jim and Steve grew up and were sold to seperate professional horse racers.  Jim and Steve said their goodbyes, wished each other luck, and admitted to a permanent tie.\n\nWith the experience they had gained racing each other, no other horse stood a chance.  Jim and Steve didn't lose a single race in their careers, yet, as luck would have it, they never had to face each other in a professional race.\n\nYears went by and eventually Jim and Steve both retired back to the old ranch they grew up on.  They were happier than ever to see each other again, the same good buddies they always had been.  Then Wilmer dropped by and said \"Hey boys, I know I'm an old crow now but my eyes are as sharp as ever!  You two never settled who was faster, and I would be proud to judge the most incredible race in history!\"\n\n\"Let's do it.\" said Jim and Steve.\n\nAnd so the race began.  Jim takes an early lead, but Steve picks up the pace and soon overtakes.  Jim, overcome with competition, picks up the pace.  It's Jim!  It's Steve!  It's neck and neck and it's...it's...\n\n\"A tie!\" exclaims Wilmer.  \"I can't believe it!  Another tie!  After all these years!\"\n\nJim and Steve collapse on the grass, exhausted.\n\nThe old ranch dog, Ralph, approaches.  \"Look, Jim and Steve.  I've been silently watching you compete since you were colts.  This race is proof that you are, and always have been, equally matched.\"\n\n\"HOLY SHIT!\" says Jim, \"A TALKING DOG!\"",

Listen, just have sex with her.\" Without blinking the bartender says, \"She huge. I mean like a metric ton. I have her here because she can't move and I need to look after her, but she won't shut up abut not getting laid. I don't need to listen to her talk about how much she wants sex.\" The bartender goes on, \"Just fuck her so she shuts up and it's ten grand in your pocket.\"\n\nThe man stands up, backs away from his bar stool and starts to walk away knowing this is no way to earn money for his family.\n\n\"Wait, wait, wait. Take a seat and have all the drinks you want.

He needs to go, right?!\" As the now drunk man says looking at the bartender.\n\nThe once sobbing now drunk man stumbles over and just comes at the huge guy while mumbling drunk nonsense. The huge guy stands up grabbing an empty bottle, but the sobbing drunk man falls over with his fist forward knocking the huge guy in the jaw onto his huge back.\n\n\"$3,000!\" The sobbing drunk man screams over the cheering patrons. The bartender is ecstatic and before he can grab the money for the sobbing drunk man, the man starts to walk down the stairs yelling, \"5 grand!\"\n\nThe dog starts to growl, then bark and yipe. The man walks up the stairs and says, \"Ok! Where is your sister with the soar tooth?!\"\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "If you have ever used an electric fence or know someone who has one, you should read this. \nThe language used is a bit salty, but 'he tells it like it is' without cursing.\n\nIf you don't laugh hysterically at this, CHECK YOUR PULSE... this is funny... and true. This was sent by a retired dentist.\n\nWe have the standard 6 ft. fence in the backyard, and a few months ago, I heard about burglaries increasing dramatically in the entire city. To make sure this never happened to me, I got an electric fence and ran a single wire along the top of the fence.\n\nActually, I got the biggest cattle charger Tractor Supply had, made for 26 miles of fence. I then used an 8 ft. long ground rod, and drove it 7.5 ft. into the ground. The ground rod is the key, with the more you have in the ground, the better the fence works..\n\nOne day I'm mowing the back yard with my cheapo Wal-Mart 6 hp big wheel push mower. The hot wire is broken and laying out in the yard. I knew for a fact that I unplugged the charger. I pushed the mower around the wire and reached down to grab it, to throw it out of the way.\n\nIt seems as though I hadn't remembered to unplug it after all.\n\nNow I'm standing there, I've got the running lawnmower in my right hand and the 1.7 giga-volt fence wire in the other hand. Keep in mind the charger is about the size of a marine battery and has a picture of an upside down cow on fire on the cover.\n\nTime stood still.\n\nThe first thing I notice is my pecker trying to climb up the front side of my body. My ears curled downwards and I could feel the lawnmower ignition firing in the backside of my brain. Every time that Briggs & Stratton rolled over, I could feel the spark in my head. I was literally at one with the engine.\n\nIt seems as though the fence charger and the piece of shit lawnmower were fighting over who would control my electrical impulses.\n\nScience says you cannot crap, pee, and vomit at the same time. I beg to differ. Not only did I do all three at once, but my bowels emptied 3 different times in less than half of a second. It was a Matrix kind of bowel movement, where time is creeping along and you're all leaned back and BAM BAM BAM you just crap your pants 3 times. It seemed like there were minutes in between but in reality it was so close together. It was like exhaust pulses from a big block Chevy turning 8 grand.\n\nAt this point I'm about 30 minutes (maybe 2 seconds) into holding onto the fence wire. My hand is wrapped around the wire palm down so I can't let go. I grew up on a farm so I know all about electric fences. But Dad always had those piece of shit chargers made by International or whoever that were like 9 volts and just kinda tickled.\n\nThis one I could not let go of. The 8 ft. long ground rod is now accepting signals from me through the permadamp Ark-La-Tex river bottom soil. At this point I'm thinking I'm going to have to just man up and take it, until the lawnmower runs out of gas.\n\n'Damn!,' I think, as I remember I just filled the tank!\n\nNow the lawnmower is starting to run rough. It has settled into a loping run pattern as if it had some kind of big lawnmower race cam in it. Covered in poop, pee, and with my vomit on my chest, I think 'Oh God please die... Pleeeeaze die'. But nooooo, it settles into the rough lumpy cam idle nicely and remains there, like a big bore roller cam EFI motor waiting for the go command from its owner's right foot.\n\nSo here I am in the middle of July, 104 degrees, 80% humidity, standing in my own backyard, begging God to kill me. God did not take me that day. He left me there covered in my own fluids to writhe in the misery my own stupidity had created.\n\nI honestly don't know how I got loose from the wire.\n\nI woke up laying on the ground hours later. The lawnmower was beside me, out of gas. It was later on in the day and I was sunburned.\n\nThere were two large dead grass spots where I had been standing, and then another long skinny dead spot where the wire had laid while I was on the ground still holding on to it. I assume I finally had a seizure and in the resulting thrashing had somehow let go of the wire..\n\nUpon waking from my electrically induced sleep I realized a few things:\n\n1 - Three of the fillings in my teeth have melted.\n\n2 - I now have cramps in the bottoms of my feet and my right butt cheek (not the left, just the right).\n\n3 - Poop, pee, and vomit when all mixed together, do not smell as bad as you might think.\n\n4 - My left eye will not open.\n\n5 - My right eye will not close.\n\n6 - The lawnmower runs like a sumbitch now. Seriously! I think our little session cleared out some carbon fouling or something, because it was better than new after that.\n\n7 - My testicles are still smaller than average yet they are almost a foot long.\n\n8 - I can turn on the TV in the game room by farting while thinking of the number 4 (still don't understand this!!!).\n\nThat day changed my life. I now have a new found respect for things. I appreciate the little things more, and now I always triple check to make sure the fence is unplugged before I mow.\n\nThe good news, is that if a burglar does try to come over the fence, I can clearly visualize what my security system will do to him, and THAT gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling all over, which also reminds me to triple check before I mow.",

I looked around and saw the Father beaconing me toward the confessional. \nHe had been listening to this one woman for an hour, and really, really, needed a bathroom break. He asked me if i could take over for a second so he had time to slip out and take a piss. \"But I wouldn't know what to do.\" I told him. But he slipped out of the confessional nonetheless and started hurrying toward the bathroom. \"Don't worry, its easy\" he called back \"I have a cheat sheet in the booth, just listen to the sin, look at the sheet and give the appropriate penance.\" What was I to do? I got in and listed to this woman's confession, and looked at the cheat sheet and gave penance. Simple, just like Father had said. But soon she began talking about how she had given a blow job to a stranger and that stumped me. I looked and looked but there was nothing  on the sheet about bj's. I peaked out of the booth in hopes I would see the priest returning, but there was no such luck. The only other person in the chapel was one of my friends, another alterboy. Paniced, I called him over and asked what the Father usually gives for blow jobs. My friend looked at me and said sheepishly, \"usually a Snickers bar and a pat on the head.\" ",

The chief says to the three explorers: \"you will pay the ultimate price for disturbing our land. First you will be starved into weakness and agony. After you cannot resist, our warriors will rape you and then torture you to death. Finally, our women will skin you and we will use your skin to waterproof our canoes. However, we are not entirely without mercy and will grant each of you one final request before your punishment.\"\n\nThe first explorer asks to fetch something from his rucksack he would like to see one last time.

Next, the second explorer also asks for his rucksack and shoots himself in the head as well. The last man standing watches the village women collect him. The third explorer asks for his rucksack.

And one day i took her phone to see what time it was and she got so pissed and told me not to ever touch her phone again. But i just simply never asked her because i guess i didnt want to know the truth.  But last night when she just left the house without telling me where she was going i couldnt wait anymore. So i went outside and hid behind my car so i can see which car she is going to get in, i got down on my knees and saw the huge rusty spots on my front tire brake shoe. So please tell me what to do!can i drive with it?Is it safe?Or should i change them?I got those from my friends shop but im wondering if its some cheap china shitty brand-so should i just get the new or what?Thank you!Please tell me what to do!",

He only asked that none of them fuck his 18 year old daughter. The three travelers agree to the terms and head off to the spare bedroom to get some sleep.\n     30 minutes later, the farmer's 18 year-old daughter comes into their room and proclaims she wants each of them inside her one at a time. The friends remember their promise to the hospitable farmer, but also can't help but notice the daughter's amazing figure even more.\n     The next day the farmer bursts through the spare bedroom door and says \"Alright, time to see who fucked my daughter!\" He instructs the first traveler to pull his pants down. After a short argument he finally drops trou only to discover his penis is missing. The farmer says, \"You fucked my daughter last night didn't you?\" To which the traveler replied, \"Yes, sir I did and I'm very sorry.\" The farmer then turns to the second friend and asks him to drop his pants to the floor. Looking terrified he obliges and finds that his favorite toy is no longer dangling between his legs. The farmer says, \"You fucked my daughter last night didn't you?\" To which the traveler replied, \"Yes, sir I did and I'm very sorry.\" Finally the farmer turns to the final traveler in the room and instructs him to take off his pants. The third traveler agrees and upon doing so no one can help but notice that his penis is still swinging from its normal position.

He carefully crept into bed next his wife, who fell sleep angry hours earlier, and gave her a goodnight kiss on the check in hopes that she wouldn\u2019t wake up.\n\nHe awoke in the middle of the night to a strange man standing at the end of his bed wearing a long flowing white robe. \u201cWho the hell are you,\u201d demanded James, \u201cand what are you doing in my bedroom?\u201d The mysterious man answered \u201cThis is not your bedroom, and my name is St. Peter\u201d.\n\nJames didn\u2019t take the news so well\u2026 \u201cYou mean I\u2019m dead! That can\u2019t be, I have so much to live for, I haven\u2019t even said goodbye to my family\u2026 you\u2019ve got to send me back right away!\u201d\n\nSt. Peter replied \u201cYou cannot go back as you were, you have passed away James. However, you can be reincarnated - but there is a catch. We can only send you back as a dog or a hen.\u201d James was devastated, but knowing that there was a farm just down the road from his house, he asked to be sent back as a hen.\n\nA flash of light later, he was covered in feathers and clucking around pecking at corn on the ground. \u201cThis ain\u2019t so bad,\u201d he thought until he felt a strange feeling churning inside him. The farmyard rooster strolled over and said \u201cSo you\u2019re the new hen, huh? How are you enjoying your first day here?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad\u201d replies James, \u201cbut I have this strange feeling inside like I\u2019m about to explode\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019re ovulating\u201d explained the rooster, \u201chaven\u2019t you ever laid an egg before?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever\u201d replies James.\n\n\u201cWell just relax and let it happen.\u201d\n\nAnd so he did, and just a few uncomfortable seconds later an egg pops out from under his tail. An immense feeling of relief swept over him - emotions got the better of him as he experienced the joy motherhood for the first time. When he laid his second egg, the feeling of happiness was overwhelming and he knew that being reincarnated as a hen was the best thing that ever happened to him\u2026 ever!\n\nThe joy of motherhood continued to build and, just as he was just about to lay his third egg, he felt an enormous smack on the back of his head and heard his wife shout \u201cJames, wake up you drunken bastard, you\u2019re shitting the bed!\u201d",

Why would you try to cut in line?\"\n\nThe nun who tried to cut in line tells him, \"If I'm going to have to gargle that water, I'm sure as hell doing it before Sister Bethany puts it up her ass!\"",

I knew she was into some hanky-panky and I began to look around. \n\nI went onto the balcony of our 9th floor apartment and found the guy clinging to the rail by his fingertips.

At this point the stress got to me and I suffered a massive heart attack and died.\"\nThe clerk thanked him and sent him on to the waiting room.\n\nThe second applicant said that his last day was his worst. \"I was on the roof of an apartment building working on the AC equipment. I stumbled over my tools and toppled off the building. I managed to grab onto the balcony rail of a 9th floor apartment but some idiot came rushing out on the balcony and bashed my hands with a flower pot. I fell but hit some awnings and bushes and survived, but as I looked up I saw a huge chest falling toward me. I tried to crawl out of the way but failed and was hit and killed by the chest.\" \n\nThe clerk couldn't help but chuckle as he directs the man to the waiting room.   \nHe is still giggling when his third customer of the day enters. He apologizes and says \"I doubt that your last day was as interesting as the two fellows that arrived here just before you.\"\n\n\"I don't know\" replies the man. \"Picture this: I'm hiding in this cedar chest...\"\n",

He stops and spots a bar across the street. He hobbles over to it trying his hardest to old his waste in.\n\nHe bursts through the tavern doors. The bar is dank and smells of stale beer. It looks completely empty. \n\"Hello?\".\nThere's no answer. He spots the toilet door by the end wall and makes a dash for it feeling like he's going to explode at any moment.\n\nHe swings the toilet door open revealing a single toilet. He was a bit thrown back by this but time wasn't exactly on his side, he needs to get this demon out of him now. He throws the toilet door closed, pulls his pants down, turns around, and before he could even get his arse on the seat, all hell brakes lose. He unloads what feels like the biggest shit of his life. Nothing in the world mattered at that moment, he had done it.\n\nSitting there on his throne, sweating and feeling like a million bucks he reaches for some toilet paper.\n\"Oh shit\", he thinks.\nThere's no toilet paper. There's no toilet paper holder. There's not even the cardboard roll left. Panicking and frantically looking around for anything to wipe with he spots a hole where the toilet paper holder would be. Above it is some writing.\n\n\"Wipe your ass with your finger, put it in this hole and it will be magically cleaned\".\n\n\"This must be a joke\" he thought.\nBut, fuelled by desperation and curiosity he goes for it.\nHe scrapes as much shit as he can off with his index finger. He holds his breathe, aligns his finger to the hole, closes his eyes, and slots it in.\n\nWhat he didn't know was at the end of that hole was a long, sharp, pin.\nHe pricks his finger, let's out a yelp, and without thinking he shoves his finger into his mouth to soothe the pain.\nThere, clean.",

The priest's face dropped a little and he leaned in to whisper \" I will trust you to keep this quiet, yes I did once meet a beautiful woman on holiday and she invited me to her room after a few drinks and we... well you know\".\n\nAt this the Imam didn't smile or recline as the priest had, instead he leaned in closer and asked \"So how was it?\".\n\"It was one of the best experiences I can remember having\" replied the priest.\n\nLeaning in that little bit further, the Imam said with a barely hidden grin \"Beats a fucking bacon sandwich doesn't it\"",

All gone now. Ghosts of their former existence. The AQ Khan nuclear weapon network's warheads, although never used, had clearly left their mark on what was once the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. North Korea's shipment to Karachi was intercepted by the Indian coast guard when the ship tried to covertly make its way through Indian waters, and the discovery of weaponized uranium in the ship under thermal maskers made New Delhi go wild. A few disastrous trilateral diplomatic back-and-forths happened, and suffice it to say that everything outside Balochistan in Pakistan, and the entire North part of the Korean peninsula are now wastelands, along with Varanasi.\n\nThe Baloch insurgency quickly scurried into power, filling the power vacuum in south-west Pakistan with a precedent-setting level of organization and speed and non-violence. They even allowed free travel of journalists, immediately setting up border checkpoints to allow entry and appointing a foreign ministry and constructing a visa system, all within a month, and without even having a full formed government yet. However, the power got to the head of the leadership, and taking advantage of the massive public approval, a monarchy was established, with Emperor Hakim Mohammad taking the lead. It was promised to be a constitutional monarchy, but the constitution never came, as those who applied to draft it slowly went missing.\n\nIt is 2087. The Emperor is on his hospital bed, his sons Mittoo, Gittoo, and Jittoo on his side. The throne was going to be occupied by the oldest brother, and as opposed to speculation by the international media, none of the three brothers truly wanted the throne. The Empire Treasury would keep all family members of the Emperor rich and healthy, and being in the public eye as a monarch did not appeal to the three Oxford-educated men. Mittoo and Gittoo were very close, and Gittoo was willing to do everything including taking the throne for Mittoo. As it turned out, Mittoo could not handle being the heir for long.\n\nIn the Empire of Balochistan, even the princes had powers and responsibilities thrusted upon them as soon as they came back from the UK. The heir especially had the most work to do, with public appearances and hour-long speeches occupying a typical week for most of the days. Jittoo, who wanted to prove his worth to his brothers, came forward to take the reins from Mittoo, who was relieved, and pleasantly surprising Gittoo along the way. The next day, as Mittoo wandered the streets in the euphora of freedom, he was run over by a truck. Jittoo could not believe it, and as much more devastated Gittoo was by their brother's death, he took the title of heir from Jittoo until he could function normally again. Jittoo was still a kid at heart and body, and his source of inspiration died. This was going to be very difficult to recover from.\n\nHowever, in exactly one year, Gittoo hurriedly handed over the title of heir to Jittoo, leaving Balochistan, and settled in Poland, serving as honorary Ambassador of the Empire to the country. No longer than Jittoo took the throne, his wife left him. \"I need to be away for a while,\" she said, and he was doubtful whether she would ever come back without a lawyer. To make matters worse, economic mismanagement in the empire culminated in several deaths in the week-long Hurricane Sara. The agriculture industry was ravaged, and aid was the only way for the Empire's people to survive.\n\nAs the Emperor's condition worsened, Jittoo had a bigger and bigger disaster on his hands. The people started protesting at the Empire's inefficiency and demanded Gittoo's return to the throne. The empire cut off Jittoo's salary. Jittoo decided that he had had enough. He was now going to get Gittoo to return, no matter what the cost. He chartered a flight to Warsaw and tried persuading Gittoo.\n\n\"The people want you back! I can't do this. I can't keep facing public opposition!\"\n\nGittoo thought about it and he made up his mind. He replied, \"So no one told you life was gonna be this way, Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's DOA. It's like you're always stuck in second gear; when it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year; but, I'll be the heir for you, when the rain starts to pour; I'll be the heir for you, like I've been the heir before; I'll be the heir for you, cause you were the heir for Mittoo.\"",

When someone rose to object, the man had pushed him forcefully.\n\n\"The judge listened solemnly, fined the woman a silver dollar and the man a twenty-dollar gold piece.\n\n\"Almost immediately afterward, seventeen men and women were brought in. They had been ringleaders of a crowd that had demonstrated for better quality meat at a supermarket.

'We have a legal maxim that goes, \"Screech is silver, but violence is golden.\"'\n\n\"'In that case,' said Feghoot, 'why did you fine the group of seventeen a silver dollar apiece when they had committed far worse violence?'\n\n\"'Oh, that's another legal maxim,' said the judge.

And it holds nothing more than my property: A stack of forged passports, two submachine guns, 20000 dollars in gold, a Rolex watch, which can shoot a laser from the crown, my pet ferret Rocky, and an explosive device, which is currently not armed.\"\n\nThe Sheriff gulps.

        "body": "Credit where credit is due: This is from [Simon Rich](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/11/18/guy-walks-into-a-bar).\n\nSo a guy walks into a bar one day and he can\u2019t believe his eyes. There, in the corner, there\u2019s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.\n\nSo the guy asks the bartender, \u201cWhere\u2019d he come from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThere\u2019s a genie in the men\u2019s room who grants wishes.\u201d\n\nSo the guy runs into the men\u2019s room and, sure enough, there\u2019s this genie. And the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d So the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cO.K., I wish for world peace.\u201d And there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and then the room fills up with geese.\n\nSo the guy walks out of the men\u2019s room and he\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nSo the guy processes this. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cDoes that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cYeah. Why, what did you wish for?\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWorld peace.\u201d\n\nSo the bartender is understandably ashamed.\n\nAnd the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it\u2019s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI feel like I should explain myself further.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nBut the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.\n\nSo the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nAnd then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d",

She takes off all of her clothes and continues falling.\n\nJust then she falls into a powerful waterspout, spinning round and round she gets quite dizzy. The waterspout is so powerful; it crosses the equator with the stewardess inside. Once past the equator, the waterspout loses momentum. As the waterspout approaches an uncharted island, the shallow water causes it to break up, depositing the naked stewardess gently on the island.\n\nToo dizzy to stand and amazed that she is alive, she passes out. A while later she is woken up by someone shouting \u201cHallelujah\u201d. \n\nThe stewardess, now awake, but still naked sees a dishevelled man with a long beard approaching her.

Her neighbors, friends, and school members always loved hearing her jokes, and she loved getting laughs from friends. However, all of her immediate family despised her because of her weight. You see, she was always very low or average weight, whereas her family was all extremely overweight. There were all extremely wide people, especially her parents. She took out this anger by doing comedy, which allowed her to not only do what she loved, but also vent about her real life issues. She got incredibly popular, which lead to her family feeling even more spiteful. No matter what she did, movies, television roles, stand up shows, her family still hated her. However, this all changed after one of her shows. She met a man, and they immediately fell in love. They both had similar scenarios in life, and found that they could relate to each other incredibly well. So, after a while, he decided to propose to her after one of her shows. Of course, she says yes. This lead to a very long and troubling wedding planning. They didn't want to do something standard like a barn or a chapel. They decided that they wanted to have their wedding on top of a mountain. That way, they could have incredible photos, incredible view, and then have an amazing hike back down. The rest of the planning went relatively well, until about a week before the day. They realized that Joan's family would not be able to make it up their mountain due to the height of the mountain and because of the oxygen difference. That, and her family all drove Hummers which likely could not make it up the mountain. So, they decided to hire a valet. It came to the big day, they were all at the top, until they met the valet with one problem; he was incredibly short. Essentially a midget. They knew this would be an issue, and they could see the Hummers pulling up all the way down the mountain. Joan's fiancee decided that he would go back down the mountain with the valet to get them up. Several minutes later, Joan's fiancee is stuck at the bottom of the mountain with the short valet, the Hummers, and Joan's spiteful family. The valet is too short to even drive the hummer, leading to mocking from her family and making the fiancee extremely uncomfortable and trying to drive the hummer himself, but it would simply not go up the mountain. He calls his future wife to tell her the situation, and of course, she is extremely worried, she asks \"what are we going to do?\" To which he replies,\n\n\n\"Ain't no mountain high enough, ain't no valet low, ain't no Rivers wide enough, can keep me from gettin' to you babe!\"",

He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper's cemetery in the Nova Scotia back country.  \n\nAs I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost and, being a typical man, I didn't stop for directions. I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch. \n\nI felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn't know what else to do, so I started to play. The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man  with no family and friends. I played like I've never played before for this homeless man. And as I played \"Amazing Grace,\" the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. \n\nWhen I finished, I packed up my bagpipes and started for my car. Though my head was hung low, my heart was full. As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, \"I  never seen anything like that before and I've been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.\"\n\nApparently, I'm still lost....it's a man thing.\n",

The Bishop decided that he would himself conduct the interviews, and went up into the belfry to interview the candidates. After observing several applicants demonstrate their skills, he decided to call it a day, when an armless man approached him announcing that he was there to apply for the post.. The Bishop, incredulous declared, \" My Son, you have no arms!\" \" No matter\" replied the man. He then proceeded to strike the bells with his face, producing the most beautiful melody on the carillon. The Bishop was astonished, believing he had indeed found a suitable replacement for Quasimodo. But in rushing forward to strike a bell, the armless man tripped, and plunged headlong out of the belfry to his death in the street below. The Bishop, stunned rushed to his side. When he reached the street, a crowd had gathered around the fallen figure, drawn by the beauty of the music they had heard, but a moment before. As they parted in silence to allow the Bishop through, one of the number asked \" Bishop, who was this man?\"\n\n\n..\" I don't know his name\" replied the Bishop sadly, \"But his face rings a bell.\"\n\n\n\nThe following day, despite the sadness that weighed heavily on his heart following the death of the armless camponologist, the Bishop continued his interviews for a bell ringer for Notre Dame. The first man to approach addressed him, \"Your Grace, I am the brother of the poor armless wretch who fell to his death from this belfry yesterday. I pray that you will allow me to replace him.\" The Bishop agreed to an audition, but as the man reached to strike the first bell, he groaned, clutched at his chest, collapsed, and died on the spot. Two monks, hearing the cries of grief from the Bishop at the tragedy, rushed up the stairs...... \"What as happened? Who is this man?\" they cried. \" I don't know his name\" exclaimed the distraught Bishop \"...but he's a dead ringer for his brother.\"",

That's the only thing we can allow.\" The guy guesses that this really is his only chance, so he agrees reluctantly.  \nSo he's back on Earth in this beautiful chicken coop, the sun is shining, there's green grass everywhere, this is hen paradise. The other hens greet him with delight and he tells them his story, everything goes nicely. But then he feels kind of unwell, there's something wrong with his stomach. He asks this old hen: \"Tell me, I've got this weird feeling in my belly, I'm not too well. What is happening to me?\"\n\nThe old hen: \"Well dearie, we hens lay eggs, you know. I bet you've never laid a nice egg before... You need to push it out now, and you'll feel much better after!\"  \nSo the guy pushes and pushes, and *wham*, out pops his first egg. The old hen congratulates him and he feels much better. But not 5 minutes later, his pain comes back. He returns to the old hen for advice.\n\n\"Well dearie, it's quite special but it happens that you need to lay TWO eggs, so go back there and keep pushing!\"   \nSo he goes back to his nest and pushes, and nothing comes, and he pushes harder, and *wham*, out comes his second egg! He feels much better, but not 2 minutes later, you guessed it, he's back in terrible pain and goes to see the old hen.\n\n\"What's this bullshit here, and don't tell me I've got a third egg to lay!\" The old hen can't make head or tail of it and just tells him that when in doubt, he should be pushing. So the guy goes back to work and then, *wham*, his wife wakes him up with this smashing slap in the face and yells: \"*Aren't you fucking done shitting the bed, you son of a bitch?*\"",

Without a means of pulling wagons and plows and no money to buy a new horse, the farmer just sat down by the side of the road, crying and wondering how he would feed his family now.\n\nThen along came a priest and wondered why he was crying, so the farmer told him about the dead horse. The priest told him that he would help him.\n\nWhen evening had fallen, the priest had the farmer follow him over to the baron's mansion, and together they sneaked into the baron's stable, to the box where the baron kept his prized white arabian war stallion. The priest opened the box and led out the horse, gave the reins to the farmer and told him to be off.\n\n\"But if the baron finds out, he will hang me for sure!\" the farmer objected.\n\n\"No problem,\" said the priest, \"you just go home and take care of your family, and I'll take care of the baron.\"\n\nWith renewed hope the farmer quietly led the white horse out of the stable and home to his farm. Meanwhile, the priest laid down to sleep in the horse's box.\n\nIn the morning the baron fancied a ride through the countryside, so he came out to the stable and opened the box, but instead of finding his prized stallion, he found a priest lying in he hay.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this!? Where is my horse!?\" shouted the baron.\n\nThe priest woke up and saw the baron, then looked down at himself, sprung up and started shouting \"Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!\"\n\nThe baron was very surprised and asked what he meant. So the priest tells him \"I used to be a priest in a village not far from here, but for many years I secretly sinned. I drank, visited prostitutes and gambled, even while telling my congregation to not do so. Because of my sins and hypocrisy, the Lord transformed me into a horse as punishment, and tonight it appears I have finally been shown mercy! Praise the Lord!\"\n\nThe baron is amazed and also starts praising God's mercy. Then he lets the priest leave.\n\nIn the afternoon, however, the baron, now lacking a horse, goes down to the village to buy a new one. In the market place he encounters the farmer, leading his old white horse by the reins. At seeing this, he is furious, runs up to the farmer and horse and starts shouting:\n\"You damned scoundrel! You couldn't last even a day before you went right back to your sinful ways, could you!?\"",

He's weaving in and out of traffic, he's almost clipping cars, he is cutting people off, driving like an absolute mad man. Within a minute, a police car is zooming right on their tail, sirens blaring. The pope quickly pulls over as the officer rushes over and pounds on the window, ready to pull his gun should there be an incident.\n\nThe pope slowly opens the window. \"May I help you, officer?\"\n\nThe police officer stares at him in shock. Seconds tick by with an awkward silence hanging in the air before the officer turns around and goes back to his car, then radios to HQ and demands to speak with the police chief.\n\n\"What do you want?\" the chief growls.\n\n\"Yeah, chief... I just pulled someone over, but I can't arrest him,\" the cop says. \"He's kinda a big deal.\"\n\n\"Big deal? What, some athlete?

One day he finally got fed up with his repetitive, insignificant life and decided that he would leave his hive, his family, his entire close-knit bee community and he would go out into the world and make something of himself, just like the humans do. So the bee enrolls in school, and passes with flying colors. Remember, this is a very smart bee. He gets his high school diploma in a little under 3 years, with a 4.0 GPA and all that snazz. After high school, believe it or not, the bee gets accepted to Harvard. Harvard! This too proves to be no challenge for our hero, as he graduates in just two years, again a 4.0, on the Dean\u2019s list, and all that snazz. Not to mention all the clubs and sports he was in-the newspaper, rowing, student government-and the fact that he was by far the most popular student on campus. Even his professors looked up to him. He goes on to get two PhDs, and when he finishes his education, the bee faces a bit of a dilemma. How does he apply his knowledge now? Where does he go from here? He decides to try out politics. After all, he was popular throughout school, did well in Harvard government. So he runs for mayor, and wins in a landslide. He greatly reforms the city, fixing virtually all its major problems. He runs for governor and again wins in a landslide. Two years later, the presidential election was coming up, and the bee decides he might as well go for it. Of course, he wins in the largest landslide in US presidential history. His presidency goes exceedingly well-he is loved by all parties, and has the highest approval ratings in history. He also finds the cures for cancer, AIDS, and broken hearts while in the White House. After 8 years (yes, of course he was reelected) the time has come for him to leave his office. Even his successor his saddened by the bee\u2019s departure, but they all know it\u2019s what must be done. Back at his vacation home in California his first day after leaving office, the bee looks back on his long and fruitful life. He realizes that he hasn\u2019t been back to his hive at all since that first day he left. He suddenly feels a twang of guilt as he realizes how much he misses his parents and his little brother. So he heads back to the hive, looking more worn out than he remembers. He goes inside and greets his family, who are overjoyed at the sight of him. He talks about how his life has gone as his family listens in wonderment. Eventually he decides he is thirsty, so he decides to visit the old watering hole he remembered. Once he gets there though, there\u2019s an extremely long line. He decides it\u2019s worth the wait, so gets in line. One hour. Two hours. This is the slowest moving line he\u2019s ever seen! Eventually he calculates that it could be a few days before he gets to the front of the line, so decides it\u2019s not worth it. He decides to go get some cider to drink instead, but waddya know, another huge line of people waiting for cider! He remembers one other drinking area that never had a long line-fruit punch! So he decides to go get punch. He arrives, and lo and behold, there\u2019s no [punch line](https://i.imgur.com/BTNIDBR.gif?1).\n",

She lived a long and productive life, had an outstanding career, supported equal rights for all citizens, and ultimately, she went out doing what she loved, which is getting surgery. We'll miss you Joan.\n\nThough she may have passed, Joan Rivers will always be with us, not only in our hearts, but as non-biodegradable remnants that will remain in our soil for future civilizations to unearth.\n\nI predict that the Joan Rivers plastic mask is going to be a hit this Halloween, hell, it should be after all the years Joan spent promoting it.\n\nIt has just come out that Joan is going to have a burial ceremony. The Rivers family had originally planned to have her cremated, but were informed that with the level of petrochemicals in her body, she would likely continue burning for approximately 15 years. Though the idea of utilizing this fire for the sake of a memorial was briefly considered, burial was decided on due to lower maintenance.\u00a0\n\nApparently the burial of Joan Rivers is to cost in the neighborhood of 3 million dollars. Though the family has made plans for a rather modest ceremony, the state has required that they pay upfront for brownfield remediation expenses.\u00a0\n\nJoan Rivers is to set the Guiness World Record as being the first human being to fly around the world post-mortem! This will be accomplished through her reuse for the manufacture of floatation devices and dinner trays on yet-unnamed airlines.\n\nAlready missing Joan Rivers? Well it seems you won't have to for long! A Cambridge Massachusetts start-up, in conjunction with the Rivers estate, is going to reanimate the collected scraps from Joan's sugeries over the past few decades. Utilizing recent advances in stem cell research and modern plastic surgery, there should be a fully grown perfect replica by this coming spring. While the camp is very optimistic about the replicas appearance, they've remained extremely conservative on the expected level of humor, saying that at best, it'll be on par with Jeff Foxworthy or Carlos Mencia. Hey, far from perfect, but not bad for 2014!\n\nJoan Rivers' new standup DVD comes out tomorrow, it'll be called \"Jokes You A******s Will Probably Make About Me When I Die\". All DVD cases will be made from unused portions of face that will no longer be needed.\n\nA news report has just surfaced regarding the nature of the surgery that Joan Rivers was undergoing at the time of her cardiac arrest. Though early reports stated that it was some form of neck surgery, she was in fact recieving surgery to relieve the tightness in the upper tendons of her middle fingers, as they were stuck in the \"up\" position.\u00a0",

After months of nearly fruitless endeavor, he found a compound that when applied to the animal will completely stop the aging process making it biologically immortal.\n\nThrilled with his discovery, Dr. Smalls went to work immediately producing more and more of the compound. Soon he realized that one key ingredient was running low. He looked everywhere for it, but found out that it was no longer produced by any chemical manufacturer. Desperate, he investigated the chemical makeup and discovered the reason for its lack of availability. Apparently, the chemical comes from the feathers of an endangered species of myna bird and its sale was declared illegal years ago.\n\nNot wanting to let his research go to waste, he hatched a plan. He found that a zoo in his area actually had one of the birds in their African habitat. He planned on birdnapping the bird and keeping it alive to harvest its feathers. Quickly he drove down to the zoo which is where he saw a few flaws. First of all, the exhibit was very carefully locked down, with bars over the entire habitat. Second, he realized that even if he were to get in, there were several hungry lions nearby. \n\nDeciding to throw caution to the wind, late one night he snuck into the zoo to attempt to get the bird. He found the bird with out any problem and managed to put it to sleep and slip it into a bag. Then he realized that he was trapped. While he was drugging the bird, one of the lions had walked out and fell asleep in front of the entrance. Slowly and carefully, Dr. Smalls managed to put one foot than another over the lion without waking it up. Unfortunately for him, the whole time he was being watched on the zoos security cameras and was arrested as soon as he tried to leave.\n\nIn court the judge threw the book at him and charged him with crossing a myna over a staid lion for immortal porpoises.

His ship capsizes, and the man wakes up on the shore of a desert island with only one pig, and his trusty doberman, who was sailing with them. The man adapts, survives, etc. Fishes with a spear, makes fire, builds his own hut, purifies his own water, and feeds his four-legged friends, etc. Cast Away style and shit.\n\nAfter a few months the man starts to get a little *lonely.* The pig is starting to look pretty good -- that soft, pink flesh, that nice, round ass... those thin, wiry, blonde hair strands. \n\nSo one day he's gazing into the eyes of his beautiful pig. He pets his pig. He then begins to grope his pig. One thing leads to another, and soon enough, the man is inside of his pig, performing smooth, insidious thrusts. In the heat of his moment, the man's doberman starts biting at his ankle, trying to wrangle him around. \n\n\"AH SHIT!\" the man yells, kicks the dog, and begins to nurse his injury.\n\nDays later, Dog's out on the beach digging a hole or whatever... chasing crabs and shit. The man is yet again alone with his pig and starts to feel that urge. \n\nHe goes over to the pig, double-checks to see his dog preoccupied, and starts railing this pig. Sure enough, the second he looks down, there's his fucking trusty doberman again, gnawing his leg. \n\n\"GAH! DAMMIT WHAT THE FUCK???\" He screams, kicks some sand at the dog, and wraps up his ankle with some leaves. \n\nNext day, man sees his dog playing with a stick. \n\nThinks, \"Hm... dog+stick...\"\n\nTakes the stick, and throws it as far as he can into the jungle. Dog bolts into the trees in pursuit of the stick.\n\n\"AIN'T NO DOG GONNA FIND NO STICK IN NO JUNGLE! HA! HA! HA!\" he says, running for his pig. He plops down on his knees behind Pig, and gets back to business. \n\nAmongst his passion, the man recognizes a burning pain in his lower leg. He detaches from his piggy fantasies to see the doberman teeth-deep into his ankle yet again, blood all over the goddamn place.\n\n\"OH GOD DAMMIT PISS!\" He dresses his wounds, and then in overwhelming frustration, the man collapses for a nap. \n\nThe next day the man is staring into the horizon, when he sees a ship. He looks closer only to notice that there is a figure atop the ship, a woman. Not only is she a woman, but a *drop-dead gorgeous* woman. \n\nSo Dude swims out there Baywatch style, saves the woman just as the ship sinks below the surface, and brings her back to his island. She's completely unconscious.\n\nHe finally revives her and she says to him, \"Oh my god thank you so much! You saved my life!! I wish there was something I could do to repay you! Oh! Anything, I'll do anything!\" \n\nSo, Dude thinks for a minute and says:  \"Well... you wanna take my dog for a walk?\"",

Chris was able to break free with just a few scratches, but there was no way it wasn't totaled.\n\n\"WHY GOD!! WHY?? WHY ME??!\" Chris yelled.\n\"Oh, wow, well... this is embarrassing... I actually DID get the wrong Chris.\" \nGod continued.\n\"Same name... even same mother's name, but different SSN. Wow, what are the chances, yeah, I meant to throw lightening at that branch for a different Chris....\nHere's what I'll do: Ask one thing of me, anything reasonable that doesn't include your wealth, fame, or love, and I'll get it to you by Monday.\" God said.\n\nChris, a man of manly needs and forever an Upton fanatic, quickly answered God to leak him nudes of his heartthrob, Kate Upton.\n\n\"Ha! Ok, you sure?\" \"Ya.\" \"Great. That will be easy!\" God said... \"Jason Verlander can't keep it in his pants when Kate's around anyway, you know what I mean? His cellphone camera, I mean. Ok, Chris, I'll throw you a bone. Check reddit and 4chan over the weekend for your surprise.\"\n\nThe weekend passed and Chris was distraught. He found his gift, along with many other generous gifts of the same nature, and yet, when God asked him on that gleeful Labor Day how he enjoyed the gift, Chris dejectedly replied, \"Not only do I wish to return my gift... but I no longer believe in you.\"\n\n\"WHOA! Buddy! You don't BELIEVE in me? The earth is literally gushing with joy because of this. I came through and gave you even more than was asked! Furthermore, I can't just, like... undo that! Y'know? What's going on? Why do you want this? Are your genitals okay?\" God asked.\n\n\"Well, you see, God, on Friday, you quite literally crushed my car, my dream. Over the weekend, you promised you'd make it up to me. Instead, you also ended up taking my fantasies.

Ever since he was a boy, he would play with his toy trains and dream of driving trains for a real train company.\n\n\n\nSo, when he turned 18, he packed his bags and waved goodbye to his family. He headed out the door and walked all the way to the local train driver's school, where all the best train drivers learned their craft.\n\n\n\nHe spent four years in the school, learning all the secrets of operating trains. He'd spend late nights studying how to accelerate and honk the horn. He was going to be the best train driver in the history of trains.\n\n\n\nSo, when he got his diploma of train driving, he rushed straight to the nearest railroad company. When they saw his credential, he was hired instantly. And so his train driving career had begun.\n\n\n\nHis first day of the job, he was driving a wonderful train down the tracks. All of a sudden, he saw a young woman standing on the tracks!  He slammed his foot down on the brakes, hoping to stop the train before it hit the poor lady. Sadly, he was too slow. The woman was killed by the train.\n\n\n\nNow, in his hometown, killing anyone with a train is illegal, even by accident. And so the man was sentenced to death by electric chair. As he sat in death row, the warden approached him and asked what he'd like his last meal to be.\n\n\n\nHis request was quite odd, it turned out, as he asked for buttermilk pancakes and an orange Popsicle. The warden, however, obliged the man's odd request and got him his last meal. The man ate his meal in silence, knowing his time on the earth was almost gone.\n\n\n\nThe next morning, he was woken and taken to the electric chair. He was strapped in by the warden, who then walked over to the switch. The prison warden pulled down the switch, but nothing happened. The man was unharmed!\n\n\n\nNow, in the man's hometown, you're free to go if the electric chair fails to kill you, so the man was relieved of all charges. He went home, a bit shaken up mentally, but physically unharmed.\n\n\n\nThe next day, he returned to his train driving job and started operating the train. He was driving along, not a care in the world, when he saw another young lady on the tracks. Alarmed, he slammed on the brakes, but was too slow. Another woman was dead, due to his train.\n\n\nAnd so he found himself again on death row. The warden came by and inquired what he would like for his last meal. The answer was the same. Buttermilk pancakes and an orange Popsicle.\n\n\n\nHe awoke the next morning in his cell, and was taken to the electric chair. The warden pulled the switch, but nothing happened! He was again free to go home.\n\n\n\nAnd so, once again, he returned to his job the next day. He drove his train for quite some time, without any problems, when he saw yet another young lady on the tracks. He pulled the emergency brake, hoping to save the woman's life, but he was too slow. She, unfortunately, was hit by the train.\n\n\n\nFor a third time, the man found himself in a cell. For a third time, the warden asked for his last meal order. And for a third time, he order buttermilk pancakes and an orange Popsicle.\n\n\n\nThe next morning, he was taken to the electric chair. The warden strapped him and and prepared to pull the switch. The man sat tensed, not sure what was about to happen. However, when the switch was pulled, nothing happened.\n\n\n\nThe man sat in the seat for a minute, thinking to himself. Finally, he spoke up.\n\n\n\n\"After being in this chair three times, I've come to realize something. I guess I'm just not a good conductor.\"",

It is decided that Brezhnev should bring a large painting entitled \"Lenin In Poland.\" After all, what could be a more meaningful expression of Soviet-Polish solidarity than a portrait of Lenin, the god of Soviet communism, visiting Poland? Unfortunately, Lenin never visited Poland, and the \"great masters\" of the Artist's Union, their minds constricted by socialist realism, can come up with no ideas how to depict Lenin in Poland.\n\nTime is running short, and the Soviet leadership is growing desparate. Finally it is decided to approach Rabinowitz, a dissedent artist. \"We know you have voiced many complaints against your country,\" a visiting KGB delegation tells him. \"But if you perform this service for the motherland, we promise you a large apartment and a lot of work.\"\n\nRabinowitz agrees to make the painting of Lenin in Poland. Three weeks later, the day before the trip, Brezhnev leads a delegation of Politburo members into a conference room. There stands Rabinowitz in front of a large canvas covered by a drop-cloth. \"Let us see the painting,\" Brezhnev orders.\n\nRabinowitz removes the drop-cloth, and everybody in the room gasps.. The painting shows a man in bed with a woman.\n\n\"Who is that man?\" someone shouts at Rabinowitz.\n\n\"That's Trotsky.\"\n\nAnother gasp.\n\n\"And who is the woman?\" another Politburo member yells out.\n\n\"Krupskaya, Lenin's wife.\"\n\n\"And where is Lenin?\" Brezhnev thunders\n\n\"Lenin's in Poland.\"",

Concerned, he goes into the catacombs to search. \nHe finds the bishop hunched over a podium with the original copy of the bible, furiously writing away, and *crying*. *Weeping* into the bible. The priest runs up to him, shouting, \"What's wrong? What's wrong? What happened?\"\nThe bishop answers through tears.\n\"The word was '*celebrate*'!\" he says, \"*Cele-BRATE!*\"",

That's brilliant!\" Exclaimed the newly relieved horse farmer, and on his way home he went to measure the lengths of his horses tail.

There, in the corner, there\u2019s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.\n\nSo the guy asks the bartender, \u201cWhere\u2019d he come from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThere\u2019s a genie in the men\u2019s room who grants wishes.\u201d\n\nSo the guy runs into the men\u2019s room and, sure enough, there\u2019s this genie. And the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d So the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cO.K., I wish for world peace.\u201d And there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and then the room fills up with geese.\n\nSo the guy walks out of the men\u2019s room and he\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nSo the guy processes this. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cDoes that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cYeah. Why, what did you wish for?\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWorld peace.\u201d\n\nSo the bartender is understandably ashamed.\n\nAnd the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it\u2019s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI feel like I should explain myself further.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nBut the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.\n\nSo the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nAnd then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s just grab a beer. It\u2019s on me.\u201d\n\nFrom: http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/11/18/guy-walks-into-a-bar",

My wife doesn't work. Your friend Donny must be mistaken.\" Vito quickly responds \"Sir I'm afraid not. Donny and I were just talking about it this morning before I left to pick you up. If you would like I could pull around the corner and wait. Then you can see for yourself it's true.\" Senator Russo agrees to it and so within 15 minutes another cab pulls up the the front of his apartment and out walks his wife  Mrs. Russo. She hops into the back of the cab as it begins to drive off. Panicky speaking Russo hoppers \"Hurry Vito. I need you to follow them. I must know where she has been going every day.\" After following the cab for about a 20 minute drive through the city, past the suburbs on into a stretch of open land. The cab then turns into a large gated house up on a hill. Mrs Russo jumps out and pays the cab driver Donny before walking up and into the large home. Vito stops and says \"I am so sorry to tell you this Mr Russo, but this house here is a well known cathouse.\" Mr. Russo gasps saying \"Are you telling me my wife works in a whore house?\" Vito shrugs and says \"No sir I'm only stating the fact to you that this is a place of prostitution.\" Not knowing what to do. Mr. Russo says to Vito \"As you already know,  I'm a well known  politician, and there is no way I can be seen entering such a place. It would ruin my career. If I were to pay you $50, would you kindly go in there and retrieve my wife for me?\" Of course Vito who would never turn down an easy $50, gladly accepts the offer. Mr. Russo is waiting approximately only 10 minutes before he sees Vito walking out of the whore house dragging a woman behind him. Kicking and pulling her by the hair he opens the back of the cab and tosses her inside next to Mr. Russo. Battered and bleeding the woman looks up at Mr. Russo.

They fill the percussionist's drum to the brim, rendering it so heavy that he can barely lift it. They fill the lute-player's lute until he has to drag it out of the court with both hands.

The doc has just purchased a new diagnostic machine (similar to those used to diagnose car problems, except this one diagnoses humans), and he\u2019s been dying to try it out on his first patient. He says to the guy \u201cnot only will this thing tell you what\u2019s wrong with you, but it will even prescribe a remedy. All you need to do is provide a urine sample, which I will then pour into this funnel at the top.\" The guy does as instructed, the doc pours the sample into the analyzer, then after about 20 seconds of beeping noises, buzzing, and flashing lights the machine spits out a piece of paper into the bottom tray. The doc picks up the paper, reads it, and then says, \u201cyou have tennis elbow\u201d. The guy says, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t make sense. I don\u2019t even play tennis, and my elbow feels fine. My head on the other hand is fucking killing me\u2026\u201d At this point the doc interrupts and says, \u201cnonsense, this device doesn\u2019t lie. I want you to go home and soak that elbow overnight and then come back and see me tomorrow morning, and don\u2019t forget to bring another urine sample with you.\u201d The guy leaves, but on the way home decides that this doctor is full of shit. He then has an idea. Once home, he finds a mason jar and deposits a small urine sample into it. He then gets his wife, daughter, and dog to also make a contribution. Not satisfied with this he scrapes some oil off the garage floor under where his car is parked and drops that into the mix, and for the icing on the cake he chokes his chicken long enough to get the desired results, drops that into the jar, seals the lid, and then gives the concoction a good shake. \u201cThere ya go, doc. Stick that up your computer!\u201d Next morning he hands the doc the jar. Doc pours the contents into the machine. This time it takes a full 10 minutes for the paper to drop. Doc picks it up and begins reading: \u201cYour wife\u2019s pregnant, your daughter\u2019s fucking the entire football team at Richmond High, your Doberman has rabies, your Volvo needs an oil change, and if you don\u2019t quit spanking your monkey you\u2019ll never get rid of this tennis elbow!\u201d",

Now we'll have to go up there, find the owner, apologize and see how much your lousy drive is going to cost us.'\n\nSo the couple walked up to the house and knocked on the door. A warm voice said, 'Come on in.'\n\nWhen they opened the door they saw the damage that was done: glass was all over the place, and a broken antique bottle was lying on its side near the pieces of window glass.\n\nA man reclining on the couch asked, 'Are you the people that broke my window?'\n\n'Uh...yeah! , sir. We're sure sorry about that,' the husband replied.\n\n'Oh, no apology is necessary. Actually I want to thank you.. You see, I'm a genie, and I've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years. Now that you've released me, I'm allowed to grant three wishes. I'll give you each one wish, but if you don't mind, I'll keep the last one for my self.'\n\nWow, that's great!' the husband said. He pondered a moment and blurted out, 'I'd like a million dollars a year for the rest of my life.'\n\n'No problem,' said the genie 'You've got it, it's the least I can do.. And I'll guarantee you a long, healthy life!'\n\n'And now you, young lady, what do you want?' the genie asked.\n\n'I'd like to own a gorgeous home in every country in the world complete with servants,' she said.\n\n'Consider it done,' the genie said. 'And your homes will always be safe from fire, burglary and natural disasters!'\n\n\n'And now,' the couple asked in unison, 'what's your wish, genie?'\n\n'Well, since I've been trapped in that bottle, and haven't been with a woman in more than a thousand years, my wish is to have sex with your wife.'\n\nThe husband looked at his wife and said, 'Gee, honey, you know we both now have a fortune, and all those houses. What do you think?'\n\nShe mulled it over for a few moments and said, 'You know, you're right. Considering our good fortune, I guess I wouldn't mind, but what about you, honey?'\n\nYou know I love you sweetheart,' said the husband. I'd do the same for you!'\n\n\nSo the genie and the woman went upstairs where they spent the rest of the afternoon enjoying each other.\n\n\nThe genie was insatiable. After about three hours of non-stop sex, the genie rolled over and looked directly into her eyes and asked, How old are you and your husband?'\n\n'Why, we're both 35,' she responded breathlessly.\n\n'No Kidding,' he said.\n\n\n'Thirty-five years old and you both still believe in genies?'\n\nEDIT - Obligatory first time to front page recognition.

He knocked on the door and was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, grey beard. \"I'm lost,\" said the man. \"Can you put me up for the night?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" the Chinese man said, \"but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man.\"\n\n\"Ok,\" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house.\n\nBefore dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful, and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man since she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during he night, he could bear it no longer, and sneaked into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn he crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy.\n\nHe woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, \"Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest.\"\n\n\"Well, that's pretty crappy,\" he thought. \"If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about.\" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: \"Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle.\"\n\nIn a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder.\n\nAs he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, \"Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost.\"",

I think I'll have one too.\"\n\nAgain, the Russian obligingly went to fetch it, and while he is gone the other American picked up the other shoe and spit in it. The Russian returned with the coke, and they all sat back and enjoyed the short flight to New York...As the plane was landing the Russian slipped his feet into his shoes and knew immediately what had happened...\n\n\"How long must this go on?\" the Russian asked. \"This enmity between our people.....this hatred... this animosity... this spitting in shoes and pissing in cokes?\"",

However, he really is getting frustrated that I can't focus and have problems concentrating on things. He says that he will dwell on some alternatives and call a parent teacher meeting next week to discuss them.\n\nMy parents drag me to the school, eager to hear what Mr. H has to say, although their English wasn't great they liked to be involved in every single one of my affairs. So there we are sat down and waiting. In comes Mr. H excitedly telling my parents that he's found some great summer schools for me, some trips away, some that mix outdoor activities and learning. It's all sounding great.\n\nMy parents are really struggling to understand him and he's getting worked up, he just wants to help me improve my focus in class. My parents start to get pushy, they can't understand him when he speaks fast. He's flustered and blurts out\n\n\"I'm saying your son needs to be put in a concentration camp!\" \n\nThat they understood.\n",

Should I fall in battle, it is to you to release her from her belt so she might marry again.\" He then leaves on his journey.

King Arthur was worried about leaving Queen Guinevere alone with all those Knights of the Round Table. So he went to Merlin for some advice. \n\nAfter explaining his predicament to Merlin, the wizard looked thoughtful, and said that he'd see if he could come up with something, and asked him to come back in a week. \n\nA week later, King Arthur was back in Merlin's laboratory where the good wizard was showing him his latest invention. It was a chastity belt, except that it had a rather large hole in the most obvious place. \"This is no good, Merlin!\" the king exclaimed, \"Look at this opening.. How is this supposed to protect m'lady, the Queen?\" \n\n\"Ah, sire, just observe.\" said Merlin as he searched his cluttered work bench until he found what he was looking for. He then selected his most worn-out wand, one that he was going to discard anyway. He then inserted it in the gaping aperture of the chastity belt whereupon a small guillotine blade came down and cut it neatly in two. \n\n\"Merlin, you are a genius!\" said the greatful monarch, \"Now I can leave, knowing that my Queen is fully protected.\" \n\nAfter putting Guinevere in the device, King Arthur then set out upon his Quest. Several years passed until he returned to Camelot. \n\nImmediately he assembled all his knights in the courtyard and had them drop their trousers for an informal 'short arm' inspection. Sure enough! Each and every one of them was either amputated or damaged in some way. All of them except Sir Galahad. \n\n\"Sir Galahad,\" exclaimed King Arthur, \"The one and only true knight!

Both teams trained hard and long. On the day of the competition, both teams thought themselves to be in top condition, but the Japanese won by a kilometer.\n\nAfter the loss, there was an atmosphere of defeat in the Finnish team. However, the leadership of the company decided that they had to win next year, for image reasons. They assigned a project group to solve the problem. After long analysis of the problem, they found that the Japanese had seven rowers and one person who steers(translation?), whereas the Finns had one rower and seven steerers(?).\n\nIn this crisis the leadership showed considerable ability to perform. Consults were hired to investigate how the team was put together. After a few months' work, experts arrived at the conclusion that there were too many steerers and too few rowers. Based on the report from the experts, the leadership of the company immediately made changes to the team. There were now four steerers, two executive steerers, a team leader and a rower. Additionally, a bonus point system was developed to motivate the rower. \"We have to extend his job and give him more responsibility.\"\n\nThe next year the Japanese won by two kilometers. The Finnish team fired the rower for bad performance, but still paid a bonus to the leadership for the efforts they had made.\n\nFor next year, the Finns are developing a new boat.",

One was an Englishman, one was French, one was a Russian and the last prisoner was a Jew. They were all put in a dingy prison cell.\n\nThe Germans decided to execute the captured soldiers. They decided amongst themselves that the most enjoyable way to kill the enemy soldiers was to ask them their profession, when they were civilians back home. They would then be killed by their individual professions.   \n \nThe first was the Englishman. The Germans asked him what his profession was. He said, \"blacksmith\".  The Germans bound his hands let down his trousers, placed his penis on an anvil and hammed his penis till he died. The rest of the prisoners shivered in terror, but did not notice the Jew, who has moved away from them and was standing in the far corner of the cell. \n\nThe second prisoner was the Frenchman. The Germans asked him what his profession was. He said, \"baker\". And so the Germans bound his hands let down his trousers, and roasted his penis over a brazier of burning coals, in full view of the others. The Frenchman died in agony.\n\nThe third prisoner was a Russian. They inquired of him his profession.\nHe said, \"tailor\". They bound the hands of the Russian, let down his trousers and stuck needles in his penis till at last the Russian gave up his ghost.\n\nFinally the Germans turned to the last prisoner - the Jew. He refused to come out of the cell. So they went into the cell and dragged him out.\nThey asked the Jew what his profession was. The Jew looked at the Germans square in the face and sniggered, but refused to answer. \nThe Germans became angry and started slapping the Jew who eventually yelled at them. \"All right, I will confess. I'm a lollypop \nmaker and you can suck mine off!!!\"\n",

Bound and beaten, they are approached by the tribes shaman. The shaman explains to them that: \u201cwe believe that we can\u2019t eat bodies of creatures with strong spirit. If you complete our challenge, you are free to go and no one will harm you. The rules are simple, take a basket, fill it with one sort of fruits and come back to me, then I\u2019ll explain you the second part\u201d. So the three adventures took the baskets, went into the jungle and after a while the first one returns with a basket full of mangos. The shaman looks at him and the basket and speaks up: \u201c The second part of the challenge is, \u2026 if you manage to stick everything you have in your basket up your ass without showing any kind of emotion, you are free to go\u201d. One mango ,, plumb. Second mango \u2026 oh that pain, the man screams and chop, is head falls to the ground severed from his body. The second man comes with a basket full of the smallest berries you ever saw. The shaman explains him the rules, and the man starts ditching the berries up his ass, \u2026 one, two \u2026 twenty. As there were only two berries left in the basket when the man starts laughing like a mad man. The shaman is surprised, but it\u2019s an emotion and the rules are clear \u2026 head off. \nThe two dead men meet outside the heaven\u2019s gate and the first one can\u2019t comprehend his second friends laughter, and confused asks him why would he burst out in laughter so close to freedom. The second one, taking a deep breath but still in chuckle. .. I just couldn\u2019t .. when I saw John coming back with a basket full of pineapples. \nBadum Tss. (sorry for the grammar). \n",

The couple decides to walk up to the house and fess up to what they've done.\n\nThey knock on the door and a man answers holding a golf ball. \"Are you the ones who hit this ball?\" he asks. \"Yes, I'm very sorry\" says the husband. \"No, thank you very much, come in, come in!\" says the man.\n\nConfused, the couple steps into the house. The man points to a shattered lamp on the ground. \"Do you see that lamp? I'm a genie and I have been imprisoned there for the past 3000 years. Because you set me free, I'll grant each of you a wish, and then take one for myself.\" He turns to the wife and asks \"What is your wish?\"\n\"I'd like a house in every country so I can vacation somewhere different every year!\" she says. The genie snaps his fingers, \"Done!\" he exclaims. He turns to the husband, \"What's your wish?\" he asks. \"I'd like ten million dollars deposited in my bank account every year for the rest of my life.\" Once again the genie snaps his fingers, \"Done!\"\n\nThey both turn to the genie and ask \"Well, what's your wish?\" \"Well, I've been imprisoned in a lamp for the past 3000 years,\" the genie explains, \"It gets kind of lonely...I'd kind of like to sleep with your wife.\"\n\nThe couple step aside and discuss this and determine that they're getting a good deal out of this, so they figure why not. The genie takes the woman upstairs and has his way with her. \n\nAfter a few hours, the genie rolls over and looks at the woman, \"How old is your husband?\" he asks. \"35\" she replies.\n\"..and he still believes in genies?

I can't tell if people are trolling, or they're genuinely offended over some meaningless joke? \n\nWho are these people? Are they that serious about poltical correctness that a joke is troublesome? I don't know anyone like that in real life. My cousins and friends used to make all kinds of jokes about race, sex, God, family members, anything growing up. We are so advanced with offensive material that nothing is shocking. And it's honestly great, we have the best sense of humor out of anyone I know. If telling jokes was regulated by the people who complain on this subreddit, i'd probably be in jail.\n\nDoes anyone empathize with my situation? Does anyone else reckognize telling jokes reveals nothing about your character? I definitely think it's more of an American thing. At a chemistry lab i was in a few years ago, I overheard someone make a comment and I made a joke about mexicans, and these canadian post graduates cracked up and told me they thought I was hilarious. They said it was so rare to find an American who would make an ethnic joke so candidly. And we built such a great friendship. They knew it was okay to make jokes about anything. We had lunch damn near everyday, we looked out for each other with the course material, and we ALWAYS laughed our asses off. \n\n\nI just don't comprehend any other viewpoint other than this. How can you be so uptight? Even if something negative happened to you that's in the joke (you were raped--God forbid--and the joke is about rape), if you were honest about why the subject was hard for you, I could empathize and throw some love your way.\n \nBut just to say something is offensive? Like I said I dont know if theyre trolling or sincere, but it's just pathetic to me. \n\nReminds me of this quote:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RBPB6NM.jpg\n\nEven Bill Hicks, a shocking, provocative yet compassionate stand up comedian, was on Howard Stern saying that he's offended by a lot of stuff, but he, along with the majority of normal human beings, realize that they can change the channel, and maybe it isn't for them. It's that minority of 5%ers that write letters and complain, and expect the world to cowtow to them. \n\n\nSorry for the rant. But, I figured if people feel the need to complain and cry about stuff they find offensive, and ruin the vibe for the rest of us having a good time, sharing jokes, I should at least let it be known they're a nusance and find some like minded people who know what humor is all about.\n\nHaving said that, Ill leave you with [Arj Barker's favorite \"joke\" Joke.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIjoq5jC0So)",

You may choose any item from a particular floor or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you CANNOT go back down except to exit the building!\"\nSo, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband.\nThe 1st floor sign reads:\nFloor 1- These men have jobs.\nThe 2nd floor sign reads:\nFloor 2- These men have jobs and love kids.\nThe 3rd floor sign reads:\nFloor 3: These men have jobs, love kids and are extremely good looking.\n\"Wow,\" she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.\nShe goes to the 4th floor and the sign reads:\nFloor 4- These men have jobs, love kids, are drop-dead good looking and help with housework.\n\"Oh, mercy me!\" she exclaims, \"I can hardly stand it!\"\nStill, she goes to the 5th floor and the sign reads:\nFloor 5- These men have jobs, love kids, are drop-dead gorgeous, help with housework and have a strong romantic streak.\nShe is so tempted to stay. But she goes to the 6th floor and the sign reads:\nFloor 6- You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store!!\nTo avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opens a New Wives Store across the street.\nThe 1st floor has wives who love sex.\nThe 2nd floor has wives who love sex and have money.\nThe 3rd through 6th floors have never been visited.\n",

So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving, which is unlikely. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today.\n\n>Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.\n\n>This gives two possibilities:\n\n>1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.\n>2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.\n\n>So which is it?\n>If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that, 'It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,' and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct..... ....leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, Teresa kept shouting 'Oh my God.'\n \nTHIS STUDENT RECEIVED AN A+.\n",

The council agreed, the hat was passed, and the good Father went to the next horse auction.\n\nUnfortunately, Father Murphy didn't actually know much about horses, so he thought he got a good deal on the short one with the long ears.  He fed it some grain and a few carrots, and entered it in the next Saturday's races.\n\nIt came in third, and the Sunday paper reported, \"Father Murphy's ass shows.\"  And the Archbishop was NOT pleased.\n\nBased on that success, the Father fed the donkey some grain and a few carrots and entered it in the next week's race.  For reasons unknown, the little donkey WON his race, and the Sunday paper reported, \"Father Murphy's ass out front!\"  And the Archbishop shouted at Father Murphy for two whole hours on Monday.\n\nUndeterred (and rather pleased with his financial success so far), Father Murphy laid low for a week but fed the donkey some grain and a few carrots and entered it in the following week's races.  The competition was a little tougher, he finished second, and the Sunday paper reported, \"Father Murphy's ass back in place.\"  And the Archbishop was nothing short of furious.\n\nFather Murphy continued his parish's little \"side enterprise\" yet another week, but this time the Archbishop caught word of it, contacted the track manager, and had the donkey removed from the race.  Knowing that their readers would want to know, the Sunday paper reported, \"Archbishop scratches Father Murphy's ass.\"  And the Archbishop was apoplectic.\n\nSo the Archbishop, in no uncertain terms, ORDERED Father Murphy to cease and desist, and to get rid of the donkey.  Father Murphy took the animal back to the horse auction, but based on his reputation the donkey fetched $4000, which Father Murphy dutifully put back in the church's bank.  Knowing that their readers would want to know, the Sunday paper reported, \"Father Murphy peddles his ass for four thousand dollars!\"\n\nThey buried the Archbishop three days later.\n",

After he passed a younger man became leader even though he had much less experience.\nHis first task as leader was to predict if the coming winter was going to be a mild one or a harsh one. In other words, did the tribe need to gather lots of wood for fire, or just a little. The young leader had no idea how to predict the winter so he went with the safe choice and said the winter would indeed be cold and tasked everyone with gathering loots of wood.\nAs the village was working he snuck out into the forest and pulled out his cell phone. He called the local weather station and asked them \"is the winter going to be cold or mild?\" They said \"this is going to be a cold winter, yes.\" He thanked them and went back to his village and said \"Everyone! It is going to be a very cold winter, be sure to gather lots of wood!\" So they did, they kept gathering.\nAfter a couple of weeks, the leader felt content with the amount of wood they had in storage, but just to be sure he snuck out into the woods again with his cell phone. The weather station told him \"This is worse than we thought, turns out this winter is going to be extremely cold, make sure you're prepared!\"\nThe leader, now nervous, runs back to the village and tells everyone again to keep gathering wood. After another couple of weeks they had filled up all their storage houses with just lots of wood for the upcoming cold winter. But again, just to be sure, the leader sneaks out and asks the weather station again.\n\"This is going to be one of the coldest winters we've ever seen. We can't believe ourselves how cold it's going to get.\"\nThe leader gets the tribe to gather more wood, build more storage houses and fill those up as well. Everyone is beginning to get really nervous since the winter is getting closer. \nOne final time the leader calls the weather station. \"This is going to be the coldest winter in recorded history.\" The leader, in tears, desperately asks, \"How do you know this?!\"\n\"Well the Native Americans are gathering wood like crazy!!!\"",

You just have a bit of tennis elbow, nothing too serious!\" \n  The man laughs and says \"That is ridiculous! You are a quack and your machine here is a fraud! I don't even play tennis!\"\n  The doctor looks puzzled and replies \"Well, it has never been wrong before, but... I tell you what. We can provide a more thorough analysis using morning urine. Return tomorrow with this sample container filled with the first urine of the day and we'll re-check the diagnosis.\"\n  The man, annoyed by now, reluctantly agrees.

He then asks his daughter and his wife to help out and they help fill the container a bit as well. After some thought he drains a few drops of oil from the car, and tops it all off by masturbating and adding that to the mixture as well. He then heads to the doctor's office, giggling all the way.\n  Upon arrival the doctor looks puzzled at the odd-colored sample but then places it into a tray that slides out from the computer-wall. With the man still giggling in the back ground, the computer buzzes and beeps, seeming to take a bit longer this time.

So the man walks up to the bartender and says, \"Hey man, I've never been to this bar before but I hear from friends you have a magic genie that grants wishes.\" The bartender replies, \"Yes I do and because I'm feeling very generous today I'm going to let you go have one wish for free.\" The bartender then leads the man to an empty backroom filled with nothing but the genie's lamp where he is sleeping. The bartender tells the man that all he has to is rub the lamp and the genie will come out. Before the bartender leaves he pulls the man aside and says, \"Sir you have to very careful, speak very loudly and very clearly because this genie is very hard of hearing.\" \"Okay. I'll keep that in mind\" says the man.\" Then the bartender leaves and as soon as he leaves the man quickly rubs the lamp. Almost immediately the room fills with colors and smoke. Then the genie appears and says \"I am the genie of the lamp! What is your one wish?\" \"I wish for a million bucks\" says the man. All of a sudden a million ducks fly into the room. The man becomes incredibly furious because he knows that wish had been wasted. He walks out of the room, goes up to the bartender and says \"Man you were right that genie really is hard of hearing.\" The bartender replies, \"Tell me about it.

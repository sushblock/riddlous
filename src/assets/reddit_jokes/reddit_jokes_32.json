He is driving too the woods, when the sane bear leaps into his path! He hasn't even been hunting yet, but the man tries to back out. The bear puts his hands up to motion nothing will happen.

Do not ignore us this way! Take us to your leader or I will fire!\u201d\n\n     The older alien again warned his comrade saying, \u201cYou probably don't want to do that!

I want nails. Do you have nails?\"\n\nIt's a change of pace, at this point he'll take anything.\n\n\"I told you, we sell MEDICINE. Not nails, not grapes, medicine!\"\n\n\"So you don't have nails?\"\n\n\"No, I don't have nails.\"\n\n\"Do you have grapes?\"\n\n\n*****\n\n\nThe delivery works better in person, you can tell it much more organically, and giving the duck a funny voice really helps. \n\nAny thoughts or feedback?",

I didn't think much of it, dogs like meat so he was probably begging. However I noticed that the dog has a brown paper bag with a note on it, in his mouth. I went inside to tell the butcher and we went out to investigate. When the butcher took the bag, it contained a $20 bill and a note saying \"One 16oz new york strip and a quarter pound of terreyaki pork jerky.\" Amazed, the butcher and I went inside and got the meat, put it in the bag, along with the remaining change. When we set the bag in front of the dog, it picked it up and began walking off. Obviously, I was confused/impressed so I followed it. The dog walked all the way to the bus stop and sat next to the bench. I stayed across the street as to not distract the dog. A bus pulled up and the dog walked in front of the bus, looked at the sign as to where the bus was traveling to and got in line to board the bus. I ran up, whilst digging some change out of my pocket to board the bus after the dog. Once I had paid the toll and was on the bus, I decided to take the only open seat behind the dog, which was a few rows back from it. I started to lose interest after about fifteen minutes...until the dog jumped up from nowhere and clamped his jaws onto the pully stop cable thingy. As the bus stopped, he trotted off the bus and into a driveway, I got off the bus and watched him from the bus stop. As the dog approached the front door, he dropped the bag and started ramming the front door with his head. After about hitting the door 4 times, someone opened the door and began violently beating the dog. I ran up to him and yelled \"Why are you beating this dog?!

One day he finally got fed up with his repetitive, insignificant life and decided that he would leave his hive, his family, his entire close-knit wasp community and he would go out into the world and make something of himself, just like the humans do. So the wasp enrolls in school, and passes with flying colors. Remember, this is a very smart wasp. He gets his high school diploma in a little under 3 years, with a 4.0 GPA and all that snazz. After high school, believe it or not, the wasp gets accepted to Harvard. Harvard! This too proves to be no challenge for our hero, as he graduates in just two years, again a 4.0, on the Dean's list, and all that snazz. Not to mention all the clubs and sports he was in-the newspaper, rowing, student government-and the fact that he was by far the most popular student on campus. Even his professors looked up to him.\nHe goes on to get two PhDs, and when he finishes his education, the wasp faces a bit of a dilemma. How does he apply his knowledge now? Where does he go from here? He decides to try out politics. After all, he was popular throughout school, did well in Harvard government. So he runs for mayor, and wins in a landslide. He greatly reforms the city, fixing virtually all its major problems. He runs for governor and again wins in a landslide. Two years later, the presidential election was coming up, and the wasp decides he might as well go for it. \nOf course, he wins in the largest landslide in US presidential history. His presidency goes exceedingly well-he is loved by all parties, and has the highest approval ratings in history. He also finds the cures for cancer, AIDS, and broken hearts while in the White House. After 8 years (yes, of course he was reelected) the time has come for him to leave his office. Even his successor his saddened by the wasp\u2019s departure, but they all know it\u2019s what must be done. Back at his vacation home in California his first day after leaving office, the wasp looks back on his long and fruitful life. He realizes that he hasn't been back to his hive at all since that first day he left. He suddenly feels a twang of guilt as he realizes how much he misses his parents and his little brother. So he heads back to the hive, looking more worn out than he remembers. He goes inside and greets his family, who are overjoyed at the sight of him. He talks about how his life has gone as his family listens in wonderment. Eventually he decides he is thirsty, so he decides to visit the old watering hole he remembered. Once he gets there though, there\u2019s an extremely long line. He decides it\u2019s worth the wait, so gets in line. One hour. Two hours. This is the slowest moving line he\u2019s ever seen! Eventually he calculates that it could be a few days before he gets to the front of the line, so decides it\u2019s not worth it. He decides to go get some cider to drink instead, but waddya know, another huge line of people waiting for cider! He remembers one other drinking area that never had a long line-fruit punch! So he decides to go get punch. He arrives, and lo and behold, there's no punch line.",

Look 'em over and pick the one you want.\" \n\nThe man dated the first daughter. The next day the farmer asked for the man's opinion. \"Well,\" said the man, \"she's just a weeeeee bit, not that you can hardly notice...pigeon-toed.\" \n\nThe farmer nodded and suggested the man date one of the other girls; so the man went out with the second daughter. The next day, the farmer again asked how things went. \"Well,\" the man replied, \"she's just a weeeee bit, not that you can hardly tell...cross-eyed.\"\n \nThe farmer nodded and suggested he date the third girl to see if things might be better. So he did. The next morning the man rushed in exclaiming, \"She's perfect, just perfect. She's the one I want to marry.\" \n\nSo they were wed right away. Months later the baby was born. When the man visited the nursery, he was horrified. The baby was the ugliest, most pathetic human you can imagine. He rushed to his father-in-law asking how such a thing could happen considering the beauty of the parents. \n\n\"Well,\" explained the farmer, \"she was just a weeeee bit, not that you could hardly tell...pregnant when you met her.\"\n",

And for many, many generations, they were happy.\n\nBut one year, the plentiful running streams dried up, the plentiful forests withered, and the plentiful beavers left for fairer grounds. The people were having the worst drought in collective memory.\n\nTo remedy this, Chief Jumping Bear called his Shaman into his tipi.\n\n\"Shaman,\" said Chief Jumping Bear, \"I need you to find my people a new home. A home with plentiful running streams, plentiful forests, and plentiful beavers.\"\n\n\"I won't let you down, Chief. I'll let the spirits guide my tribe to plentiful running streams, plentiful forests, and plentiful beavers,\" said the Shaman.\n\nSo that night, the Shaman dreamed. \n\nHe dreamed that the tribe travelled for many many moons, over the mountains, through the forests, and across the prairies, until they arrived in a land with plentiful running streams, plentiful forests, and plentiful beavers. And in the dream, the people were happy.\n\nThe next morning the Shaman told the Chief the good news. The Chief was ecstatic, saying, \"We shall leave at once!\"\n\n\"I am glad,\" said the Shaman, \"but Chief Jumping Bear, there's just one thing I don't understand: In my dream, there was this... bacon tree.\"\n\n\"Pay it no heed.\" said the Chief, \"We leave at once.\"\n\nAnd so the tribe packed up their belongings and left. They travelled for many, many moons; over the mountains, through the forests, and across the prairies. And finally, after traveling for many, many moons; over the mountains, through the forests, and across the prairies, they arrived at the land the Shaman had dreamed of. It had plentiful running streams, plentiful forests, and plentiful beavers. And the people were happy, and rejoiced that night by the fire.\n\nAfter the festivities, when the tribe was asleep, they were suddenly awoken by bugles calling, horses galloping, and guns firing. The tribesmen came out from the tipis to see the white men coming over the hill.\n\nThe tribespeople all retreated into the forest to hide from the white men.\n\nAs it so happened, the Chief and the Shaman were hiding behind the same boulder. The Chief angrily turned to the Shaman and said, \"What is this? You said there would be plentiful running streams, plentiful forests, and plentiful beavers! Not white men!\"\n\nThe Shaman turned to the Chief with sadness in his eyes and said, \"Chief, I understand my dream now. That wasn't a bacon tree I saw.

After a few months our legionnaire becomes rather desperate for female companionship, so finally he approaches the crusty old sergeant and confesses his desperation.\n\n\"Sergeant,\" he says, \"I can't take this any longer. A man has NEEDS, ya' know! What do the other men do to relieve themselves of this terrible desperation?\"\n\nThe wise old sergeant flashes an evil grin and says \"But of course! It was only a matter of time!\" He lowers his voice to a sly conspiratorial whisper and says \"When ze men become truly desperate, zey use ze camel!\"\n\n\"The CAMEL? That flea-bitten raggedy old sway-back CAMEL? That's disgusting!\" lamented the legionnaire. \"I could NEVER do that!\"\n\nThe old sergeant simply smiled and said \"All men come to ze camel in time. The desert is patient, and can wait.\"\n\nSure enough, after a couple of more months pass, the young recruit is beside himself with desperation. He dreams about women every night, and his days are filled with fantasies. At the height of his desperation, he returns to the sergeant and agrees to meet him in the stables at midnight.\n\n\"Come alone,\" says the sergeant, \"and make no noise.\"\n\nAs instructed, the young legionnaire appears in the stables at midnight, where the wise old sergeant is waiting for him, with a bad tempered, fly blown, dung encrusted, ancient old camel on a short lead.\n\n\"I will hold ze camel's head,\" he said, \"so she cannot bite you while you mount her.\"\n\nThe legionnaire did not reply-- he was too deeply embarrassed by the situation, but he decided to just get it over with and hope that afterward he would feel better and this would all seem more normal. While the sergeant held the camel's head in the darkened stable, he heard the young recruit position himself behind the camel. The sound of pants dropping to the ground reached his ears. The beast grunted and bawled as the legionnaire thrust and moaned behind it. Eventually the young man sighed. He caught his breath and adjusted his clothing.\n\n\"Thanks sergeant,\" he sighed. \"That was pretty gross, but it helped a lot. I feel better now.\"\n\n\"Zat is good,\" replied the sergeant, \"but I have never seen anything like that in my life! How could you do zat to zis poor old camel?\"\n\n\"But you said all the men use the camel when they get desperate!\" cried the abashed young recruit!\n\n\"Zey do,\" replied the sergeant. \"Ze ride her to town, to meet ze women.\"",

We live in a high rise apartment, and as I was standing outside the door, I heard her giggling and making noises, and the faint voice of a man. When I got in there, she was surprised, and I said 'Where. Is. He.' She pretended like she didn't know what I was talking about.

I start wailing on his fingers and he's yelling at me t stop and crying, and ultimately he falls. But the bastard lands in the bushes! Not a scratch on him! So I wheel the refrigerator over the rail and toss it over right onto him. Problem was, I pushed too hard and fell, too. And that's how I died.\" Gabriel stands there for a few seconds, and bursts out laughing, unbelieving of what he heard, and sputters out, \"That's great, you're in!\" And the first guy walks into Heaven.\nSecond guy steps up and starts, \"I live in a high rise apartment, and I'm a painter. One day I was feeling particularly lazy and decided to lounge and paint on the balcony in my bathrobe. As I was painting, I tipped the easel and dropped a bunch of materials. Thinking I could catch them, I quickly leaned over the rail. Well, I went too fast and fell right over. I was lucky enough to catch myself on the balcony of the apartment below me, but I lost my robe in the process. So I'm hanging, practically naked from this balcony, and calling inside for help, but nobody is responding. Then, all of a sudden, this guy comes out with a wrench and starts hammering my fingers! I fall, and luckily I land in some bushes. Thankful for my life, I tried to crawl out, but when I looked up, I saw a fridge falling!

They shot a diamond made of iron at a car moving at 400 walls per hour, and as a result caused over 10000 wayward planes to lose track of their bearings, and make a fatal crash with over 10000 buildings in downtown New York. They spun 400 miles at diamond into iron per wall. The results were inconclusive.

He's the gentlest, sweetest dog you've ever seen. He never barks, unless there is an intruder, in which case he turns into the meanest SOB that ever lived. When he needs to go, he'll just nudge your leg once or twice and then sit by the door and wait till you're ready to let him out. My kids and wife love him, and are going to hate me for selling him, but I don't have any other options.\"\n\nThe regular says \"well jeez, guy. If that dog is that good, I'll take him. I'd be happy to help you out\"\n\nA year later the man walks into the bar again.\n\nThis time the regular is there again, but he screams \"YOU! YOU SOLD ME THAT GOOD FOR NOTHIN' SON OF A BITCHIN' DOG. That dog does nothing but shit all over the house. He barks constantly, and tries to bite my wife every chance he gets. I swear to god the day before I bought that dog was the last good day I've had\"\n\nThe man looks at the regular and says \"Mister... you ain't ever gonna sell that dog if you keep talking about him like that\"\n\n",

        "body": "This is the story of a Rabbi named Steven. Steven was lost in the mountains of Bolivia one day. He had embarked from Lima weeks ago, but his translator had taken a rather nasty tumble and was no longer with him. But the Rabbi continued. He walked forward and up, perhaps being guided by a higher force. On the eighth day of his adventure in the mountains, he stumbled upon a beautiful river in a valley. So he decided to follow it for as long as he could. \n\nHe walked for another day, until he came across a tiny village on a small island in the middle of the river. And tiny means tiny, literally miniature. The small twig huts were only a few inches tall each. The largest about two feet, and the smallest about half a foot. This, of course, intrigued Steven, so he waded into the river, and crossed to the island. When there, he realised what a state of disrepair many of the buildings were in. They were all dust free, but most of them had holes in them, or entire portions missing. It appeared as though a mini tornado had passed through. \n\nHe carefully walked around the little village until he stumbled (almost literally) upon a very small, barbaric, hospital. When he listened carefully, he could hear tiny shouts of agony coming from within. He, very lightly, tapped on the door, and a little person, no more than 3 inches tall, stepped out. She was dressed in doctor-like clothes, and had some tiny pink splotches of blood plastered on her clothing. She looked up at the Rabbi, and let out a tiny shriek. The rabbi was taken aback, and slowly sat down. The little woman ran back into the hospital, and he heard the tiny shrieks of agony silenced. But the rabbi just sat there.\n\nDays later, one of the other little doctors poked his or her head out. Very quietly, Steven said \"hello.\" This confused, and obviously frightened the small creature, but it was brave. It stepped out into the street, and though it was visibly shaking, it yelled up to him, \"we don't have any more fire crystals! Go away!\"\nThis confused the rabbi, of course, so he whispered back \"I don't know what you're talking about. I'm new to this area, and don't know what you are.\" So, the small creature patiently explained: they were a race of creatures that called themselves \"Trids\". \n\nThey had a very peaceful society, but a week ago, during the celebration of the Day of Fire, a huge troll ran down from one of the adjacent mountains, and stole their fire crystal, rumoured to be the source of all fire and energy in the village. The Trids gathered their armies, and sent them up to the Troll's cave at the top of the mountain, but the Trids all got kicked back down the mountain. So the Trids gathered their militia and sent them up, but they got kicked right back down the mountain. Then the Trids gathered their farmers and workers, and sent them up the mountain, but they all got kicked back down. And by the time they were ready to send another wave they realised that they only had a handful of doctors left uninjured.\nAnd so the rabbi offered to help, he'd get the fire crystal back. So he slept on the shore of the island, and then when he woke up at a time resembling midnight, he started his trek up the mountain. \n\nHe climbed ever so slowly, avoiding making an excess of noise. Eventually he got to the cave, and slowly sneaked inside. He saw the troll sleeping in a corner, and did a double take. This being was massive, twice as tall as he, and thrice as wide. So he made his way very slowly over to the droves of treasure that this troll had in the corner. He made it in a minute or two, grabbed all the rubies he saw, and turned around. He was about to get out of the cave when *SNAP*!\n\nHe had stepped on a twig. He slowly turned around, and the troll was awake, and up. The hulking figure was breathing very heavily, and simply staring at the rabbi. Steven did what any sane man would have; he bolted. He ran faster and further than he ever thought possible, but eventually he noticed that the troll wasn't chasing him. So he turned around. Ignoring all common sense, he started to walk back to the cave where the troll lived. Approaching the cave, he yelled in \"Troll! What happened? Why didn't you chase me and kick me down the mountain?\" Then the troll came into the light, Steven was able to appreciate the full size of the beast. A great roaring laugh suddenly erupted from the creature.\n\nThe hulking figure looked at Steven and simply said, \"Silly rabbi, kicks are for Trids!\"\n\nNinja edit: This was written on my phone, so please point out any grammatical/spelling errors!",

Johnny, a country boy, was playing hooky from the local Catholic school.\n\nHe was carrying his big fish down the road - and who does he run into but Sister Mary, one of the nuns in the parish. \n\nShe says \"Johnny! Skipping school again!? What will we do with you? But - goodness is that a fish?? Why it's one of the biggest I've ever seen!\"\n\nJohnny, quite proudly, holds it up \"yep - ain't it the bestest son of a bitch you ever seen?\"\n\nSister Mary is shocked. \"Johnny! Such language!\"\n\nBut Johnny, thinking fast, said \"Oh no, Sister Mary, I wasn't cussin' at all! Why, um, that's just what the local folk around here call that kind of fish. You got your trout, your flounders - and your sons-of-bitches\"\n\nWell Sister Mary is quite relieved, and says \"why, I had no idea! Learn something new every day! Say - why don't we take this, uh, son of a bitch and show it to the Mother Superior? I'm sure she'd be *very* impressed!\"\n\nSo they go together to the village, and show the fish to the Mother Superior, and Sister Mary says \"Isn't this a beautiful son of a bitch?\"\n\nThe Mother Superior is also shocked, and Sister Mary quickly explains that this is just the local term for this kind of fish, and it's perfectly acceptable to use the vernacular.\n\nRelieved, the Mother Superior says, \"we simply must show this excellent fish to the Monsignor!\"\n\nSo they bring the fish to the Monsignor, and the Mother Superior says \"Isn't this the largest son of a bitch you've ever seen?\"\n\nThe Monsignor is also shocked, but as before the Mother Superior explains - local term, we try to fit in with the people etc and the Monsignor is relieved and says\n\n\"This is indeed an excellent fish. The Archbishop is in residence - let us serve this fish for his supper!\"\n\nSo the fish is cooked, and the entire party - Johnny, Sister Mary, the Mother Superior and the Monsignor - all join the Archbishop for supper since, after all, it's appropriate to occasionally break bread with all levels of society.\n\nIt's a wonderful meal, and there's nothing left of the fish but bones, and the Monsignor rubs his belly saying \"That was a really good son of a bitch!\"\n\nThe Mother Superior agrees, \"Why, I think that was the best son of a bitch I ever tasted!\n\nSister Mary adds, \"I just love good son of a bitch!\"\n\nJohnny proudly adds \"And I was the one that caught that son of a bitch!!\n\nThe Archbishop looks at them all, looking from on to another. He slowly gets up, gets a cigar from his desk and returns. He puts his feet up on the table, lights the cigar and through a cloud of smoke says,\n\n\"You are *my* fucking kind of people!\"\n\n\n\n",

I lived in Washington, D.C. I had a beautiful wife, and lived on the seventh floor of a swanky high-rise apartment building. One day I get off of work early; just after lunch. I come home, and as I approach my appartment door, I hear sounds of frantic movement. When I open the door, I see my wife standing in the living room in a state of partial undress. Now, I've got something of a temper. When I see her like this, all I can think is that she's cheating on me. I fly into a rage, storming around the apartment, screaming \"where is he, where are you hiding him?\" She's trying to tell me to calm down, that there's no one else in the apartment. I march onto the balcony and see that there's a very tall African-American fellow hanging off the railing, holding on by just his fingertips. Well, I'm so enraged, I grab a hammer and start smashing his fingers until he falls seven stories straight down to the pavement. But I'm not satisfied yet. I run back inside, unplug the refrigerator, and push it over the balcony onto the poor guy. And the effort of pushing that fridge was so great that I had a heart attack and died.\"\n\nSt. Peter has listened to the whole story with a shocked look on his face. Its not the craziest story he's heard, but its pretty damn unusual. He looks at the man and says, \"Hm, ok. I'll uh... I'll have to confer with the Big Guy on this one, why don't you have a seat over there until I get this sorted out.\" The guy goes over and waits.\n\nThe next man in line is a very tall African-American fellow. And his story goes like this:\n\n\"Now, I used to live in Washington, D.C. I had an apartment on the eigth floor of a swanky high-rise apartment building. Yesterday, I was able to come home from work around lunchtime. I'm not usually home this early, so all the floors were still slippery from the maid cleaning that day. I grabbed a Coke from the fridge, and walk out towards the balcony. I lose my footing though, hit the railing. and go right over. I managed to catch myself on the railing of the balcony below mine though, and am thanking my lucky stars when some lunatic runs out with a hammer and starts smashing my fingers until I fall to the pavement. Somehow I survived this though, and when I look up, all I see is a big white rectangle growing bigger and bigger until *bam*, and I end up here.\"\n\nSt. Peter, with a rather large case of deja vu, tells the man to go on in to heaven.\n\nNow the next guy in line is Bill Clinton. And he tells St. Peter, \"So, check this out. I'm hiding in this fridge...\"\n\n\nThanks for reading the monstrous wall of text, it usually goes better when told in person.",

Hope you enjoy..\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n* Ignorance of the law excuses no man from practicing it.\n\n\n* A Laywer is a person who prepares a 50,000-word document and calls it a brief.\n\n\n* The minute you read something that you can't understand, you can almost be sure it was drawn up by a lawyer.\n\n\n* The man who said \"talk is cheap\" never hired a lawyer.\n\n\n* *Judge*: What is your name?  \n*Witness*: Abraham Liebowitz.  \n*Judge*: Are your married?  \n*Witness*: Of course!  \n*Judge*: Whom did you marry?  \n*Witness*: What else? A woman.  \n*Judge*: Mr. Liebowitz, didn't you ever hear of anyone else marrying anybody else but a woman?  \n*Witness*: You said it. Mine sister, she married a man.  \n\n\n* Judge Smith was about to sentence a sixty-year-old prisoner:  \n     *Smith*:I hereby sentence you to thirty years penal servitude.  \n     *Prisoner*: (sobbing) Your Honor, I won't live long enough to serve the sentence.  \n     *Smith*: It's all right. Just do what you can.  \n\n\n* *Defendant*: it is difficult to see how I can be a forger. Why, I can't sign my own name.  \n*Judge*: You are not charged with signing your own name.  \n\n\n* Krause was flabbergasted to learn that his client had sent a case of scotch to the judge.  \n     \"Good heavens man, you're sure to lose your case now.\"  \n     \"Oh, no, Ill win it,\" said the defendant. \"I sent it in my opponent's name.\"  \n\n\n* Fitzgerald was sitting beside the deathbed of his lawyer, Dolan. The attorney knew he was doomed and said, with a sigh, \"Dear friend, I've a confession to make. A year ago I robbed you of $200,000 in your firm's merger deal, and I also put your firm's control in my possession. I talked your wife into divorcing you and --\"  \n     \"It's all right, old friend,\" said Fitzgerald, \"I poisoned you.\"  \n\n\n* *First Lawyer*: Possession is 9/10 of the  law.  \n*Second Lawyer*: Tried any drug cases lately?  \n\n\n* Lawyer Gail Pruitt had a disagreement with the presiding judge and turned her back to the bench and returned to her table.  \n     \"Are you trying to show your contempt for this court, counsel?\" demanded the judge.  \n     \"No, your Honor,\" said the attorney, \"I'm trying to conceal it.\"  \n\n\n* Better to be a mouse in the mouth of a cat, than a man in the hands of a lawyer. - Spanish Proverb\n\n\n* Closter was a little concerned about his pending court case. He asked his lawyer, \"How should I plead?\"  \n     \"On your knees,\" said the attorney.\n\n\n* \"You seem to have more than the average share of intelligence for a man of your background,\" sneered the lawyer at a witness on the stand.  \n     \"If I wasn't under oath, I'd return the compliment,\" replied the witness.\n\n\n* Patrice, an elderly prostitute, stood before newly elected Judge Cordel.. Her appeal for leniency was so convincing that Cordell had doubts about sentencing her. He called a short recess, then went to the chambers of an older judge. \"Say, Butler,\" he asked, \"what would you give a sixty-year-old prostitute?\"  \n     \"Oh,\" said the learned jurist, \"no more than six dollars.\"\n\n\n* *The court*: Is there any reason you could not serve as a juror in this case?  \n     *Juror*: I don't want to be away from my job that long.  \n     *The court*: Can't they do without you at work?  \n     *Juror*: Yes, but I don't want them to know it. \n\n\n\nThere's A LOT more where these came from, let me know if you'd like me to keep going!\n\nEdit: formatting\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "So everybody knows that there are 3 types of Cheerios in the world. There is the Blueberry Cheerio, the Strawberry Cheerio, and the Honeynut Cheerio. We also know, to date and mate, the Cheerios are limited to only Cheerios of their own kind, ie. Strawberry Cheerios must date and mate with only Strawberry Cheerios and so on and so forth.  \n\nOur story starts with that of a young male Honeynut Cheerio, let's call him George. Now George is quite the smart guy who has graduated from the most prestigious university and the top of his class with a Ph.D in Science. Now, you'd think a Cheerio like him would be extremely happy with himself, but he wasn't. Poor George was very lonely. Wherever he went, whomever he met, he never truly connected with a female Honeynut Cheerio. Poor George was about to give up on love before he saw her. \n\nShe was a beautiful Strawberry Cheerio (let's call her Sarah) and George knew the moment he saw her that she was the one, but there was one problem, she was a Strawberry Cheerio and he was a Honeynut Cheerio. The laws of their world didn't allow this, but he had a plan. George was a smart guy and knew what to do. He spent day and days working on a machine, and before you know it, he created the CNA Modulator. Now with this machine, George could change his CNA to that of another Cheerio. George hopped in the machine and flicked it on. The lights whizzed and hummed and George was transforming. His body was hit with electricity and he was feeling intense pain, like hot knives being thrusted into his body, gouging at his insides. Then it was done. George emerged a Strawberry Cheerio.\n\nElated, George ran to the Sarah to profess his love for her, but before he could, she ran away screaming. Now, George is confused to what happened, but then he figured it out: he still smelled like a Honeynut Cheerio. Now, Sarah was also a smart Cheerio and duplicated the same machine within hours, changing her CNA to that of a Blueberry Cheerio. Not wanting to give up, George jumped into his machine and turned it back on. Once again, the pain was unbearable as his body was struck with electricty that seared his cells and fried his insides, and it was done. He was now a Blueberry Cheerio.\n\nHe ran and ran after this Sarah, his love, but before he could reach her, she started running away. Defeated, George cried. He didn't know what to do. She ran away a second time and changed her CNA to that of a Honeynut Cheerio. George wept and wept, but couldn't put her out of his mind. He knew he had to be with her. Not wanting to give up, George made a pact with himself: he'll change himself one more time before giving up. If she doesn't accept him then, he'll have to settle with some other Honeynut Cheerio girl. George hopped back into the machine and turned it on one last time. Electricty arced over his body and the pain was immense. His body was screaming with exhaustion and pain as it is his 3rd time transforming. From the steam, George emerged a Honeynut Cheerio.\n\nHe ran and ran and ran all the way to Sarah and before she could run, he stopped her and professed his love. He said that she was the only one for him. No other girl mattered. He changed himself 3 times for her. No one could compare to her. She was always on his mind. She was the only girl that he could ever love and it would mean the world if they could go out together. Sarah, swept off her feet, said yes. \n\nFast forward 2 years, the couple have had an amazing time together and are going to the Cereal Bowl (like Cinderella's Ball, get it?) for a dance before their wedding next month. They dance throughout the night, and after their 14th song, they're tired and parched, so George goes to get some drinks at the Punch Bowl. \n\nThere's quite a long line, but he doesn't mind waiting to get drinks. A couple minutes pass and he wonders how his girl is doing, so he looks over to her on the dancefloor and who else is there but the Lucky Charms guy. Even though he couldn't hear what he was saying, he saw in that little leprechaun's eyes that he wanted a touch her Lucky Charms. Furious, George was going to rush back and beat him off, but he couldn't. He couldn't return back with no drinks. He was going to look like a loser in front of his girl, so he waited... Very aggravated...\n\nA couple minutes pass and he looks over again, this time Captain (Admiral) Crunch is over there ogling her booty and her booty. Quite enraged, he was going to run over and bowl the captain over, but he couldn't. He still did not have the drinks. So he waited... Furious...\n\nA couple more minutes pass and he looks over again, and whole else but Tony the Tiger. Tony is putting his moves on his girl and they're going ggrrrrrrrrrrrreat!!! He's getting so close to her... He's getting so close... George is so aggravated, he doesn't know what to do. He wants to run there and push him off, but he can't he doesn't have the drinks, but his girl is falling for a tiger, but he doesn't have the drinks, the leprechaun is almost has her Lucky Charms in hand, but he doesn't have the drinks, Captain Crunch almost has his hands on her booty, but he doesn't have the drinks. \n\nTeeming with anger, he looks back at the bowl and notices that there is no punchline.",

I've talked to all of my so-called friends and nobody will help me out. I need a hundred dollars to take care of some problems, and having exhausted all my other options I turn to You.

Forgive me for writing again, but I've gotten myself tangled up in another mess, and I need another hundred dollars. I only ask that if You find it in Your heart to help me out again, please don't send me the money through the mail.

On one morning, the farmer went into to the barn and shockingly found his beloved cow dead on the ground. He couldn't bare telling his family about the loss so he grabed a rope and hung himself.\nA few hours later his wife came into the barn and found her husband and the cow both dead. She then took a knife and slit her wrists.\nOn the next morning the youngest son went looking for his missing parents and after finding them and the cow dead in the barn, he knew he had to relax from the shock, so he took his fishing rod and went to go fishing to the nearby river. After sitting at the river for the whole day, he surprisingly hooked something big and heavy and after reeling it in, he realized it was a beautiful mermaid.\n\"My dear boy,\" she said to him \"I know about the death of your parents. I have the power to bring them back to life, but in return you have to make love to me.\"\n'Awesome' thought the boy and he went at it. After an hour of intense lovemaking he realized that he was under some sort of spell and the mermaid wouldn't stop humping him. Then, after another hour he died of exhaustion in the middle of the act.\nOn the next morning the middle-old son also realized that everybody was dead and he also went to the river to go fishing. He also caught the same mermaid and she said the same to him as she did to his younger brother. He accepted her proposition and they began to make love. He lasted twice as long as his younger brother, but in the end he also died of exhaustion.\nOn the last morning, the oldest son realized everybody was dead and he did the same his sibblings have done. He also caught the very same mermaid and with a grin or her face, she also said the same thing to him. So they began, and after lasting several hours the mermaid thought that this one was quite enduring and that she would take alot out of him. But then the morning came and they were still at it, he lasted the next day and the next night after that. Finally after several days of intense lovemaking the mermaid suddenly collapsed and died of exhaustion. So the young boy stood up, pulled up his pants and thought to himself: 'not bad - but not as good as the cow.'",

Fearing that he hasn't lived his life to the fullest, he decides that the first thing he will do with his funds will be to fulfill a childhood dream of his: to go hunting in Africa and take down a gorilla.\n\nHe promptly arranges a flight to Africa. When he arrives, he tells the locals his intentions of gorilla hunting and asks for their recommendations. They recommend he hunts with the famous \"Great White Hunter,\" easily the best big-game hunter on the planet.\n\nThe man contacts the Great White Hunter and tells him that he wishes to hunt gorillas. The Great White Hunter tells him that this will be no problem, but that it will cost the man $1,000 per day. \"Two hundred dollars for food and transportation,\" he says, \"and two hundred dollars for each member of my crew: me, the [Watusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutsi), the dog, and the Pygmy with a gun.\"\n\nThe man decides that it is a fair amount of cash to pay and the next day he flies out to the jungle on a biplane to meet with the Great White Hunter. There they set up camp and sure enough, the Great White Hunter has with him a Watusi, a dog, and a Pygmy with a gun.\n\nThe American man, the Great White Hunter, the Watusi, the dog, and the Pygmy with a gun all head out hunting for gorillas early the next day. The Great White Hunter uses his famous skills and wisdom to track down a gorilla almost immediately. They push aside some bushes and, much to the American man's delight, they see a massive gorilla hanging out in a tree. The gorilla sees them and begins jumping on the branch, jumping on the branch aggressively.\n\nWithout hesitation, the Great White Hunter shouts a command to the Watusi, who sprints at the tree and climbs up to the gorilla's branch, and begins jumping on the branch, jumping on the branch alongside the gorilla. This carries on for nearly a minute before the gorilla begins to lose its balance. It slips and tumbles almost twenty feet to the forest floor. When it hits the ground, before it can do anything, the dog runs up and bites the gorilla in the testicles. The Great White Hunter then throws a net over the subdued Gorilla, and it's captured.\n\n\nLater that night, the American man is going to sleep in his tent, a big smile on his face, happily reminiscing on the hunting trip. He'd actually seen and caught a Gorilla! Tomorrow more adventure was no doubt at hand. The Great White Hunter told him that he'd get to throw the net! That's when he realized something: The Pygmy with a gun didn't do shit!\n\nThe next morning, the American man, the Great White Hunter, the Watusi, the dog, and the Pygmy with a gun go out hunting again, and the American man vows to watch the Pygmy with a gun carefully to try and see what he does to help. Like before, the Great White Hunter tracks down a gorilla in no time. The gorilla, hanging out in a tree, sees them, and begins jumping up and down, jumping up and down on the branch. The Hunter shouts a command to the Watusi, who scales the tree to the gorilla and begins to jump up and down, up and down on the branch. The gorilla loses its balance and plummets to the forest floor, where the dog bites it in the balls. The American man and the Great White Hunter throw the net over the gorilla, and it's captured.\n\nOnce again, the man realizes, the Pygmy with a gun didn't do shit!\n\nThe next morning, the man, angry that he's paying so much extra money for a useless team mate, approaches the Great White Hunter. \"Hey,\" he says, \"I've been watching, and the Pygmy with a gun doesn't do shit! What gives? I'm not going to pay for him!\"\n\nThe Great White Hunter calmly replies, \"I'm sorry, but that's the way it is. He's an essential part of the team, always will be. You pay for the Pygmy, or we don't hunt.\"\n\nThe man begrudgingly accepts the Great White Hunter's ultimatum.\n\nThe man, the Great White Hunter, the Watusi, the dog, and the Pygmy with a gun all go out hunting again. It's not long before the Great White Hunter tracks down a gorilla, an especially big one, who begins jumping up and down, jumping up and down in his tree. The Great White Hunter shouts to the Watusi, who climbs the tree, climbs out on the gorilla's branch, and begins jumping up and down, jumping up and down on the branch with the gorilla. After about thirty seconds, however, the Watusi begins to lose his balance. He slips and falls! As the Watusi is plummeting to the forest floor, he cries out:\n\"Shoot the dog! Shoot the dog!\"",

Frans gladly rings him up, but he's floored when the man says he doesn't have any money to pay with. \"Well I can't give you mien fleisch for nothing,\" said Frans. The man thought for a moment and then pulled a small stuffed bird out of his pocket. \"This mounted fowl has been in my family for ages,\" said the man. \"I'll give it to you as a trade for your fine food.\" Frans took him up on the offer, figuring he could put it somewhere in the store to make it feel more homey for the sailors that frequent his shop.  \nOver the next few weeks Frans' business started to go down hill. People came in less and less and Frans started going bankrupt. A month went by and he had to close the store down. Sadly, Frans took a tern for the wurst.\n\n* A young man decided it was time he went to sea, and so he went down to port to find a job on a whaling ship. After a few hours of searching he came across a fine vessel and asked the captain for a job. \"If you join my crew lad, you'll be a deckhand you know,\" said the captain. The man thought that that was fine, seeing as he'd never sailed a large ship before and would need some experience. He signed the book and was brought aboard the boat.  \n\"Lad,\" said the captain, \"Me and me mates are goin ashore for the night. I want you to clean the anchor chain while we're away. Is that understood?\" \"Aye Captain!\" said the lad. The captain thrust a broom into his hands and left. The new deckhand got to work mopping up the muddy chain. About halfway through a small bird flew up and landed on the end of his broom. He tried to keep sweeping, but the bird made it impossible. When he swept left the bird flew right, when he swept forward the bird flew backward. Fed up, the lad grabbed the bird by the feet and threw it over the side of the boat. No sooner said than done, the bird was right back atop his broom. Again the man grabbed him and threw him away, and again he flew back to his perch. This went on the entire night, the endless battle between man and bird.  \nMorning came and the captain came back to his ship to see the deckhand sleeping on the still dirty anchor chain. \"What is the meaning of this lad! I thought I told you to get this chain cleaned! This is no way to start a new job boy!\" Howled the captain. \"I'm sorry sir,\" pleaded the deckhand. \"I tossed a tern all night and couldn't sweep a link!\"",

So, that's exactly what he does and he goes on to sell 2 million apples and make 1 million dollars.

He hops in the shower and gets nice and clean, puts on some nice cologne, shaves off all those little hairs and puts on his best jacket. He decides to head down to a local bar for a drink and see where the night goes. As he orders his drink, he spied a juicy plump red tomato, just sitting alone at the end of the bar. Plucking up his courage, he goes to talk to her and offers her a drink. \n\nShe accepts, and they start talking, and find they get along really well. What the poor potato lad doesn't know is that this tomato has a boyfriend, and her boyfriend is the leader of a local gang of thug-carrots. One of these carrots is sitting in a shaded corner of the bar, and he see's this random potato talking up his bosses girl. So he calls up the boss, who calls together the gang, and they all ride up to the bar on their motorcycles, dressed in the black leather, with the fingerless leather gloves and spiked knuckles, chain belts, bandanas and all. \n\nThey walk into the bar and immediately the atmosphere turns cold and others flee out of the bar through any exit they can. Someone calls for 911, knowing there's going to be trouble. The thug-carrots lay into the poor potato, beating him senseless. They beat him within an inch of his life. An ambulance roars into the parking lot and the thugs flee from the scene, leaving the poor potato hanging barely onto his life. They drive him to the hospital and rush him right into surgery. \n\nEighteen long gruelling hours later, the doctor steps out of the surgery room. He's just spent eighteen hours straight operating on the poor potato, he's tired and exhausted, and immediately after stepping out of the surgery suite he gets ambushed by the potato's parents, asking for the status of their sun. The moms obviously been crying all night, the dad with his arm around her bravely fighting off tears to look strong. The doctor lets out a weary sigh and says \"okok Mr. and Mrs. Potato please calm down... I have some good news, and I have some bad news. The good news is, you have a strong spirited healthy son, and we think he's going to pull through this. He is a strong kid and he's holding on better then we could have possibly hoped, responding fantastically to all the treatment. There is some bad news however... we're afraid that he may be a vegetable for the rest of his life!\"",

Then she showed him certificates of deposits issued by the bank which was worth over $2 million, and informed him that they were one of the largest depositors in the bank. She explained that for the decades she had 'charged' him for sex, these holdings had multiplied and these were the results of her savings and investments.\n\nFaced with evidence of cash and investments worth millions, her husband was so astounded he could barely speak, but finally he found his voice and blurted out, 'If I'd had any idea what you were doing, I would have given you all my business!'\n",

By tying this string to the tip of our you-know-what,\nwe can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the\nneed to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in\nthe restroom by 76.39%.  \n \nI asked quietly, 'After you get it out, how do you put it back?'  \n \n'Well,' he whispered, 'I don't know about the others,\nbut I use the spoon.'\n ",

After he had moved in, he decided that he would like to have some livestock on his farm.  So he headed out to buy some livestock, but he was worried about putting animals in his fancy sports car, so he decided to walk.  It was only a mile or two, and it was a nice day anyway.\n\nHe asked if he could buy a female chicken, and the shopkeeper sold him one but told him, \"You're not from around here are you? Around here, we call those pullets.\" The banker was a little embarrassed, but pushed on.  He asked to buy a donkey as well.  The farmer sold it to him, for much more than it was worth, and said, \"'round here we call those asses. This one is a little stubborn.  If he refuses to move, just scratch him behind the ear and he'll get going again\".  Well, the banker started to get very embarrassed that he didn't even know what to call these animals so he left the store.  \n\nHe didn't get very far before he realized that his hen wasn't going to do much good without a rooster, so he went back to the shopkeeper and sheepishly asked for a rooster as well.  The shopkeeper, again, sold him the animal for more than it was worth and, grinning, said \"round here we call those cocks.\"\n\nWell, the banker started to make his way back to the new farm with one chicken tucked under each arm, the donkey's rope in one hand, and a bag of feed in the other.  About half-way back to his farm the donkey sat down and refused to move.  He couldn't put the chickens down or they'd run away, and the donkey wouldn't budge unless he got his ear scratched.  After about ten minutes of trying to convince the donkey to move, a cute lady jogger came by.  Frustrated, the banker asked \"Could you hold my cock and pullet while I scratch my ass?!\"",

He loved it so much that he started being obsessed with tractors.\n\nBy his fourth birthday, he already had 30 tractors of different sizes and colours.\n\nAs soon as he learnt how to read, he started filling his shelves in his bedroom with books about tractors. Harry Ferguson was his hero. He knew everything about his life and the tractors he invented.\n\nHis room had become a temple dedicated to tractors. Carpet, duvet, cushions, lamp, curtain, posters: everything was covered with tractors.\n\nFor his tenth birthday, his parents brought him to a farm for an incredible surprise. He was going to drive a real tractor with the help of Joe the farmer.\n\nWhat a thrill! He had never been that excited in his life. They started driving together. The little boy was so happy. This was the best day of his life.\n\nAfter driving for an hour, Joe the farmer said: \"Now i'm going to let you have a try on your own\".\n\n\nHe brought him in the middle of a field and let him drive on his own.\n\nSlowly the tractor started moving. \n\n\"Well done!\" said Farmer Joe. \"Try going a little bit faster now\" \n\nThe tractor went faster but something was wrong. The motor was doing a strange noise. Suddenly the brakes were not working anymore. The inevitable happened: they crashed into a tree and the tractor turned over. The boy was ejected from the tractor and saw Joe the farmer die, crushed by the weight of his massive tractor.\n\nThe boy broke his arm and was sent to the hospital. He was traumatised. When he arrived home, he took off of his wall all the posters, threw away anything with a tractor on it and no one ever mentioned the word tractor around him ever since.\n\nThe boy grew up. He turned eighteen. One day, he was invited at a party. He drank a few beers, chatted with some friends and talked with a pretty girl. She was tipsy and after half an hour she made a move and started kissing him. \n\nSuddenly someone shouted \"something's burning in the oven!\" A girl took out a black pizza from the oven and put it in the bin. The room was full of smoke. \n\nThe couple stopped kissing. The pretty girl said: \"we can barely see anything! There is so much smoke!\" \n\n\"Don't worry, said the boy, I'll fix it\" He got up and opened his mouth wide and started sucking up all the smoke from the room.\n\nEveryone was looking at him. \"Man, how did you do that?\"\n\n\"Oh I am an ex tractor fan\".",

We've got to go!\" She revealed that her ankle was hurt and she told him he had to carry her.

The original person called in sick at the last moment and I\nhappened to be standing there at the judge's table asking directions to the Budweiser truck, when the call came in.\n\nI was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili\nwouldn't be all that spicy and, besides, they told me I could have free\nbeer during the tasting, So I accepted.\"\n\nHere are the scorecards from the event:\n\n**Chili # 1 Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili**\n\nJudge # 1 A little too heavy on the tomato. Amusing kick.\n\nJudge # 2 Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild\n\nJudge # 3 (Frank) Holy fuck, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove\ndried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy.\n\n**Chili # 2 Arthur's Afterburner Chili**\n\nJudge # 1 - Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang.\n\nJudge # 2 -Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.\n\nJudge # 3 -Keep this out of the reach of children. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.\n\n**Chili # 3 Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili**\n\nJudge # 1 -- Excellent firehouse chili. Great kick. Needs more beans.\n\nJudge # 2 -- A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of peppers\n\nJudge # 3 -- Call the EPA. I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all of the beer.\n\n**Chili # 4 Bubba's Black Magic**\n\nJudge # 1 -- Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.\n\nJudge # 2 -- Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.\n\nJudge # 3 -- I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out tastebuds? Sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills. That 300-lb. bitch is starting to look HOT -- just like this nuclear waste I'm eating. Is chili an aphrodisiac?\n\n**Chili # 5 Linda's Legal Lip Remover**\n\nJudge # 1 -- Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.\n\nJudge # 2 -- Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.\n\nJudge # 3 -- My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed the paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from the pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming.\nScrew those rednecks.\n\n**Chili # 6 Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety**\n\nJudge # 1 -- Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spices and peppers.\n\nJudge # 2 -- The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb.\n\nJudge # 3 -- My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I shit myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally. She must be kinkier than I thought. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone.\n\n**Chili # 7 Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili**\n\nJudge # 1 -- A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.\n\nJudge # 2 -- Ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should take note that I am worried about Judge # 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.\n\nJudge # 3 -- You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit to match my shirt. At least during the autopsy, they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. Screw it, I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.\n\n**Chili # 8 Tommy's Toe-Nail Curling Chili**\n\nJudge # 1 -- The perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili. Not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.\n\nJudge # 2 -- This final entry is a good, balance chili. Neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge # 3 passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor dude, wonder how he'd have reacted to really hot chili.\n",

I asked him to tell us a bit about himself, and he told is this great story. \n\n\"See, I loved tractors, right, ever since I was a little kid, my dad would take me out to lots of tractor shows around the state, and to my favourite, tractor towing contests\". I had no idea that this was a thing, and so I asked him about it.\n\n\"It's tug of war, two tractors tied onto a big strong chain, and they try to pull each other over the mid point. Out where I used to live, these competitions where held every second Saturday, I'd won a few titles myself, actually. One weekend, quite a long time ago, I met a lady at one of these events, Angie, her name was, and we hit it off straight away. She was as into tractors as much as anyone I knew, almost more than me! I could hardly believe it. Well, 10 short months down the track, I asked her to marry me, and she said yes! In another 2 months, we married in my dad's barn. I was the happiest man alive.\"\n\nHe looks down into his empty beer glass, and spins it slowly on the bar, a sad smile playing across his mouth. I offer him a refill, but he declines. He continues...\n\n\"That weekend, Angie and I went to the tractor pulling together, as we had done every second weekend since we met, and stood on the fence line, cheering on the two tractors. The engines were revving, the mud was flying, the chain was creaking, and then...\" \n\nHe swallows, blinking. \n\n\"... The chain snaps. A single link flies off, and hits Angie, square in the chest. There was nothing I could do, nothing anyone could do.\" \n\nHe goes back to looking into his glass, slowly turning it on the bar. \n\n\"That day, I swore myself of tractors, forever. I couldn't look at a tractor without being flooded with feelings. Every second Saturday, I'd visit Angie's grave, with fresh flowers. A year passed in the blink of an eye, then 2 more. I finally got out and about, me mates dragged me down to the pub one evening, for a bucks night. While we were there, I had a few too many beers, and ended up taking to a lady who was at the pub that night. It turns out she loved tractors!\n\n\u201cWe had a good talk, and chatted long in to the night. I thought to myself, maybe this lady is the one? But just as last drinks were being called, smoke starts to come out of the kitchen, and the bartender come running out, yelling ' the place is on fire!' Everyone is rushing for the doors, but I just say there and took in deep breath, I just kept sucking in air, until there was no more to be sucked in, and the fire went out!\"\n\nI had to stop him there, that's not possible, I told him, you can't do that.\n\n\"Of course I can mate, I told you, I'm an ex-tractor fan.\"\n\nThis is a repost from a comment I made. It got a few votes, so I'm re-posting it.\n\n\n",

If she answered incorrectly, she would pocket only the $32,000 milestone money. \n\nAnd as she suspected it would be, the million-dollar question was no pushover. It was, \"Which of the following species of birds does not build its own nest, but instead lays its eggs in the nests of other birds? Is it A) the condor; B) the buzzard; C) the cuckoo; or D) the vulture?\" \n\nThe woman was on the spot. She did not know the answer. And she was doubly on the spot because she had used up her 50/50 Lifeline and her Audience Poll Lifeline. All that remained was her Phone-a-Friend Lifeline, and the woman had hoped against hope that she would not have to use it. Mainly because the only friend that she knew would be home happened to be a blonde. \n\nBut the contestant had no alternative. She called her friend and gave her the question and the four choices. The blonde responded unhesitatingly: \"That's easy. The answer is 'C' -- the cuckoo.\"\n\nThe contestant had to make a decision and make it fast. She considered employing a reverse strategy and giving Regis any answer except the one that her friend had given her. And considering that her friend was a blonde, that would seem to be the logical thing to do. \n\nOn the other hand, the blonde had responded with such confidence, such certitude, that the contestant could not help but be persuaded. \n\nTime was up. \"I need an answer,\" said Regis. \n\nCrossing her fingers, the contestant said, \"C) the cuckoo.\" \n\n\"Is that your final answer?\" asked Regis. \n\n\"Yes, that is my final answer,\" she said, breaking into a sweat. \n\nAfter the usual foot-dragging delay Regis said, \"I regret to inform you that that answer is ... absolutely correct.

He puts all of his cash in a briefcase, heads to the airport, and buys a one-way ticket to Las Vegas, with tears of relief and sadness in his eyes.\n\nOnce on the plane, he notices it's quiet.

The voice doesn't speak for the rest of the ride.\n\nThe cab pulls up to the front, and he tips the driver and exits the cab. He walks up to the big front doors, and says \"Now what?\"\n\nThe voice chimes in, \"Go inside, sit at the second roulette table on your right.\" The man sighs and heads inside. He hands over his suitcase of cash -- every last penny he owns -- and exchanges it for chips. He finds the second roulette table on the right, and sits down. The voice speaks again, \"Bet everything you own on *black four*.\"\n\n\"Are you kidding me?\" He questions the voice, and how he is about to risk everything he owns on a game of roulette. The voice just repeats the same thing, \"Bet everything you own on *black four*.\"\n\nThe man sighs and reluctantly places the bet of a lifetime. \"Well, here goes nothing.\" The table spins and spins, and finally the ball lands.

I was trying to get something from my pocket and a card fell out with another girls name, and number. I quickly jammed it back in my pocket but we both knew she saw it. It went downhill from there.\nI went about trying to be normal but the silence was thick, I tried to play some music to calm the atmosphere but even the soft words of Toto had no effect on the awkward tension. I was sweating profusely, then I knew what I had to do.\nListen, I started. I found somebody else. Her face was a blank mask as she went through a gambit of emotions. Jealousy, sadness and finally anger flashed through her eyes before she spoke. Why? she said, first softly then with more conviction. I steeled myself for the coming storm. I am sorry, it just comes down that she is nicer than you, she treats me better, and honestly she doesn't expect me to be one big cash cow like you do.\nHer mouth was agape as the words tumbled out of my mouth. I started to speak again but she quickly cut me off, We have been together for over six months! And not once have you complained! She said with conviction. Every morning and night I saw you, you were smiling and happy! I put up with all of your ridiculous short shorts and your stupid hair styles and you are just going to leave?!\nI couldn't deny it, those had been good times, but I knew on the inside that this relationship wouldn't work anymore and that my hair looks great. I looked her dead in the eye and spoke the final words \"Listen, just charge me whatever deactivation fee you guys have, My new gym is closer to me and a ton nicer. I am sorry it is just how it is going to be.\"\n\nAnd just like that, I handed in my old gym card and went on my merry way.",

He slams the ninth glass down and drains the tenth, holding it up triumphantly. The pub erupts with cheers and the amazed Texan pulls out his chequebook and writes Paddy his cheque. He hands it to him and says \"Well I'll be damned, it's true what they say about y'all! By the way, where did you go earlier?\"\n\nPaddy replies, \"To O'Malley's round the corner to see if I could do it!\"",

Life sucked pretty much, and like a lot of children, I was bullied, even by my own cousin.\n\nThis all changed one day when this man came to our nice vacation home (we were pretty rich), who claimed he worked at a prestigious boarding school to the north. My Aunt and Uncle were terrified of him for some reason, but he came to tell me that the school wanted me, since my parents went there and were good students. They wanted to continue the tradition of my old family. He also said I had inherited a big fortune from my biological parents. I was ecstatic, my life was finally taking a turn for the better.\n\nI arrived at my new school by train the next month, to the dismay of my Aunt and Uncle. I was joyful with glee, but overwhelmed by this sudden change in my life. The same guy who first came to our house helped me buy books and our new school uniform. I fit in at school pretty well, and immediately made two great friends. I was finally starting to have a good outlook on life, and everything at my new school was going great until that asshole Voldemort showed up and tried to kill me again. \n",

Three bikers came through the neighborhood and stopped at every intersection and used a can of spray paint to paint a symbol on the road surface to direct bikers in their travel on the weekend.  Lots of symbols that are a circle with a line through one side (think of a power button symbol on your computer) and basic arrows at intersections.  \n\nThe thought then struck me-- It would be pretty damn funny to go back down the route with my own can of spraypaint and redirect the bikers through the ghetto and around in a big circle going through the best drug dealing neighborhoods in town.

If both balls are in the bunker, yours is in the footprint\n\n* It's easier to get up at 6:00 AM to play golf than at 10:00 AM to mow \nthe grass.\n\n* A good drive on the 18th hole has stopped many a golfer from giving \nup the game.\n\n* Golf is the perfect thing to do on Sunday because you spend longer \npraying than you would do in church.\n\n* A good golf partner is one who's always slightly worse than you are, \nthat's why I get so many calls to play with friends.\n\n* If there's a storm rolling in, you'll be having the game of your life.\n\n* Golf balls are like eggs. They're white. They're sold by the dozen \nand you need to buy fresh ones each week.\n\n* It's amazing how a golfer who never helps out around the house will \nreplace his divots, repair his ball marks, and rake his sand traps.\n\n* If your opponent has trouble remembering whether he shot a six or a \nseven, he probably shot an eight (or worse)...\n\n* It takes longer to learn to be a good golfer than it does to become a \nbrain surgeon.

People would show up and listen and every night the brothers of this fraternity had a different woman in bed with them. They were using sympathy to get sex! I thought it was an amazing idea. I started telling people that I was Jewish.  I would bring it up whenever I could hoping one of them would here me.  One day, they did. A brother overheard a conversation I was having and invited me to join them on the next Tuesday.  I was amazed! I showed up and it got started. Everyone was telling stories and it finally came to me. I started, \"My dad actually died in a concentration camp\".  A couple of the guys look at me and ask, \"Which camp?\"  Shit, I think.  I don't know any camps.  \"Auschwitz\" I say.  \"Wow, that place was bad.  My Uncle was there.\" One of the brothers says.

I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.\n\nThe elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks.. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence. The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.\n\nThe policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.\n\nAfter about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is..\n\nSo, as the couple passes, he says to them, 'Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?'\n\nShaking, the old man is barely able to reply, 'Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence.''",

Jane turned the radio on, as she always does. Soft music as usual. Nothing has been said yet this morning, but they're both in a good mood. James, like he tends to do, began humming to the tune of the current song on the radio.\n\nJane, yawning as she is still somewhat tired since the events from the day before, says to James; \"wow! You should enter American Idol!\" She is feeling the good, fulfilled kind of tired. Ready for a new day.\n\n\"Oh? I'm flattered,\" James replied merrily. He is about to resume with the humming when he is interrupted by a short yet clear sigh.\n\nAs if to let the disappointed nasal exhale of air really sink in with James, Jane paused before she continues; \"no, no, no...\"\u2014with each \"no\", a reversal of direction for her head slowly shaking. Left. Right. Left.\n\nJames, clearly surprised and not quite knowing what to make of this, replies with the only thing he is able to say (if you could even count it as \"saying\" something); a confused, questioning \"huh?\"\n\nThe situation, while certainly confusing to James, had remained calm until now. James was still not sure how this was going to turn out, but he was beginning to suspect that it wouldn't be the friendly small-talk he expected after the first words Jane shared with him this morning. Jane, on the other hand, knew exactly what was going to happen. She'd been waiting for this for a long time. \"This is going even better than I could have hoped for,\" she thought to herself, a smirk spreading itself across her face.\n\nSlowly, as Jane opened her mouth to speak, James subconsciously registered the now wide, confident grin on her face and gradually, his body began to feel how this was going to end. In anxious anticipation of the blow, he flinched. Noticing his reaction, Jane got excited to throw it. She knew that although his body was ready, she'd still be able to strike before his (somewhat slower, when compared to hers) mind would be able to orchestrate and execute a proper dodge, but she'd have to do it right now.\n\n\"**The judges will discourage you from 'singing' ever again,**\" the sentence literally flowing out of her mouth in a bold font.",

This particularly wise sage was said to have unlocked the secrets to the most puzzling social and personal issues of their disciplines.\n\nObviously intrigued, several of the attendees approached the sage, who was seated cross-legged on a small mat, and engaged him in conversation.\n\n\"Excuse us, sir, but we have heard great stories about your accomplishments. Are the tales true? Have you found the answers to the questions of peace, love, and bliss?\", said the crowd.\n\nThe sage replied, \"well, my children, these questions are not as difficult to answer as one might think. For example, let us discuss the question of bliss. Surely a life of bliss seems a complicated and lofty goal, but it is one that can be achieved via a simple change in diet.\"\n\n\"A change in diet? What do you mean?\", the crowd asked.\n\nThe sage responded, \"many years ago, I tried to achieve a state of bliss by trying many different foods from all over the world. After several months, I noticed that a consistent diet of asparagus led me closer to a life of bliss than any other food. Asparagus, my children, is how one may achieve bliss.\"\n\nThe crowd stood stunned, but eventually replied, \"Asparagus? What does that have to do with....\"\n\nAt that exact moment, the skies opened up, and there was a torrential downpour of rain. People ran to and fro, but the entire gathering got completely soaked, as there was no shelter on the mountain summit.\n\nJust as quickly as it started, however, the rain stopped, and the sun came back out to shine. As everyone was recovering from the sudden drenching, attention turned once again to the sage. He had sat through the entire storm, but was conspicuously bone dry.\n\n\"Surely the stories must be true! You must be a very holy man to have weathered the rain untouched! Share with us your secrets!\", cried the crowd.\n\nThe sage motioned for them to come closer, and raised one finger as he spoke: \"The answer, my children, is very simple.\"\n\n\"Bliss is the awning of the sage of asparagus.\"",

He spent his time trying to feed and protect his beloved creatures of the sea. One day, in a fit of inventive genius, he came up with a serum that would make them live forever!\n\n\nOf course he was ecstatic. But he soon realised that, in order to mass produce this serum, he would need large amounts of a certain compound that was only found in nature in the metabolism of a rare South American myna bird. Carried away by his love for marine mammals, however, he decided that he would go to the zoo and steal one of these birds.\n\n\nAs he was arriving at the zoo an elderly lion was escaping from its cage. The Lion\u2019s name was Leo, which wasn\u2019t too original of a name for a lion if you ask me, but it\u2019s probably not important to the story. Anyway, the zoo keepers were alarmed and immediately began combing the zoo for the escaped animal, unaware that it had simply lain down on the sidewalk and had gone to sleep since it was Leo\u2019s regular naptime anyway.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the marine biologist arrived at the zoo and stole his bird. He was so excited by the prospect of helping his dolphins that he stepped absent-mindedly over the sleeping lion on his way back to his car. Immediately, 15 policemen converged on him and arrested him.\n\nHis crime?

She says, \"No, I'm just browsing.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps I can interest you in one of our new arrivals.  He's a very rare specimen from the jungles of South America,\" the owner says.\n\nInterested, she says \"Sure, I'll take a look.\"\n\n\"Follow me to the back, please,\"  He says.\n\nOnce they're in the back room, the owner pulls out a colorful frog.  \"This is a Brazilian Pussy Eating Frog,\" he says.  \"They were thought to be extinct, but a small population of them has recently been discovered.  I happened to know someone who could procure one for me.  It does exactly what his name implies, and will give you the most glorious orgasm you've ever had.\"\n\n\"That sounds great!  I'll take it!\" she says.\n\n\"Ok.  Here's what you do - take off all your clothes, spread your legs, place the frog in front of your pussy, and say the following:  FROG, EAT PUSSY!\"\n\nShe says, \"That sounds simple enough.  Thanks!\"  And she leaves the store in a hurry, eager to get home and try this out.\n\nShe arrives at home, goes to the bedroom, takes off her clothes, lies down on the bed, places the frog within reach of her vagina, and says, \"FROG, EAT PUSSY!\"  The frog does nothing.  It just sits there.  \"FROG, EAT PUSSY!\"  Still nothing.  It hops away, apparently not interested in eating pussy.  She decides to take it back to the store to find out if she's doing something wrong, or get her money back.\n\nShe barges into the pet store, annoyed, since she paid quite a bit for this frog.  \"Sir, this frog is not interested in eating pussy.  He appears to be a normal frog.\"\n\n\"Follow me to the back, please,\" he says.  He instructs her to remove her clothes and lie on the table.  Nervously, she complies.  He places the frog between her legs, and says, \"FROG, EAT PUSSY!\"  Nothing.  It just sits there.  A little louder, he says, \"FROG, EAT PUSSY!\"  Still nothing.  \"Not to worry, ma'am, I'll take care of this.\"  He takes the frog and places it on the other side of the table, where it can see what's going on.  \"Ok, frog - I'm only going to show you how to do this ONE MORE TIME...\"",

We seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so we're not sure what to do with you.\"\n\n\"No problem, just let me in.\" says the politician.\n\n\"Well, I'd like to but I have orders from higher up. What we'll do is have you spend one day in Hell and one in Heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity.\"\n\n\"Really, I've made up my mind.

The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a green golf course. In the distance is a club and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him, everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, hug him, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at expense of the people. They play a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster and caviar. Also present is the Devil (a politician, too), who really is a very friendly guy who has a good time dancing and telling jokes.\n\nThey are having such a good time that, before he realizes it, it is time to go. Everyone gives him a big hug and waves while the elevator rises. The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens on Heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him.\n\n\"Now it's time to visit Heaven.\" So 24 hours pass with the politician head of state joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time and, before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns.\n\"Well then, you've spent a day in Hell and another in Heaven. Now choose your eternity.\"\n\nHe reflects for a minute, then the head of state answers: \"Well, I would never have thought it, I mean Heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better off in Hell.\"\n\nSo Saint Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to Hell. Now the doors of the elevator open and he is in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags. The Devil comes over to the politician and lays an arm on his neck.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" stammers the politician. Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and club and we ate lobster and caviar and danced and had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable.\nThe Devil looks at him, smiles and says, \"Yesterday we were campaigning.

They finally got their big break to play at a famous music festival in America. The horse decided to make sure everything was going as planned, and flew over to America to set up stage and confirm their hotel reservations, playing time etc. After his hard few days, he sat in his Hotel room watching the news. On the news their was a report that an airplane had crashed into the Atlantic ocean. There were no survivors from the wreck. He suddenly realised that it was the plane that the Chicken, the Sheep and the Pig were on. Realising that he spent most of his horse life doing something that just went up in flames, he decided he needed a VERY stiff drink. He went down to the hotel bar, asking the bar man for the strongest drink he had. A few minutes later the barman came back and placed the drink on the countertop.

The world's largest retail chain is teaming up with Ernest & Julio Gallo Winery of California to produce the wines at affordable prices in the $2 to $5 range.\n \nWine connoisseurs may not be inclined to put a bottle of the WalMart brand into their shopping carts but, 'There is a market for inexpensive wine,' said Kathy Micken, professor of marketing at University of Arkansas, Bentonville. 'However, branding will be very important.'\n \nCustomer surveys were conducted to determine the most attractive name for the WalMart wine brands and varieties.\n \nThe top surveyed names in order of popularity were:\n \n \n            10. Chateau Traileur Parc\n \n             9. White Trashfindel\n \n             8. Big Red Gulp\n \n             7. World Championship Riesling\n \n             6. NASCARbernet\n \n             5.

Nasti Spumante\n \n \nThe beauty of Walmart wine is that it can be served with either white meat (Possum) or red meat (Squirrel).\n \n \nP.S. Don't bother writing back to tell me that this is a hoax. I know possum is not white meat.",

        "body": "\"So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?\" said Jack.\n\n\"Beats me,\" said Nate. \"Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your\nkind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it\ncould have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant\nrequests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals.\"\n\n\"Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out\nof the stone there?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much\nbigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember\nif it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But\none day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do\nsomething for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've\nbeen here ever since.\n\n\"What is this place?\" said Jack. \"And what did he ask you to do?\"\n\n\"Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?\" Nate loosened his\ncoils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into\nthe stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to\nenter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned\nover and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as\nJack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but\nNate was suddenly there in the way.\n\n\"You can't touch that yet, Jack,\" said Nate.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I haven't explained it to you yet,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something,\" said Jack. \"You'd push it\nthat way, and it would move in the slot.\"\n\n\"Yep, that's what it is,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"What does it do?\" asked Jack. \"End the world?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Nate. \"Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it\n'The Lever of Doom'.\" For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing\nvoice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and\ngrinned.\n\nJack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned\nJack laughed. \"Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it\nreally do?\"\n\n\"Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said,\" smirked Nate. \"I just thought\nthe voice I used was funny, didn't you?\"\n\nNate continued to grin.\n\n\"A lever to end humanity?\" asked Jack. \"What in the world is that for? Why\nwould anyone need to end humanity?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Nate, \"I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment.\nOr maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really\nbad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are\nthe rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I\ndidn't think to ask back when I started here.\"\n\n\"Rules? What rules?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it\nunless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human\ncan be bound in that way at a time. That's it.\" explained Nate.\n\nJack looked somewhat shocked. \"You mean that I could pull the lever now?\nYou'd let me end humanity?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate, \"if you want to.\" Nate looked at Jack carefully. \"Do\nyou want to, Jack?\"\n\n\"Umm, no.\" said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. \"Why in\nthe world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want\nthat! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too,\nwouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate, \"being as he'd be human too.\"\n\n\"Has anyone ever seriously considered it?\" asked Nate. \"Any of those bound\nto secrecy, that is?\"\n\n\"Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or\nanother. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and\nthink, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get\ndisgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while.\nBut he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here.\" Nate grinned some more.\n\nJack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at\nthe same time. After a bit, he said, \"So this makes me the Judge of\nhumanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?\"\n\n\"That seems to be it,\" agreed Nate.\n\n\"What kind of criteria do I use to decide?\" said Jack. \"How do I make this\ndecision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are\nbad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" replied Nate. \"You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's\nup to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed\nto know.\"\n\n\"But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel\nhorrible? Couldn't I make a mistake? How do I know that I won't screw up?\"\nprotested Jack.\n\nNate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. \"You don't. You just have to\ntry your best, Jack.\"\n\nJack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly\ngetting dark, chewing on a fingernail.\n\nSuddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. \"Nate, was Samuel the\none bound to this before me?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate. \"He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to\nread and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried\nin the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months\nago.\"\n\n\"Sounds like a good guy,\" agreed Jack. \"How did he handle this, when you\nfirst told him. What did he do?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Nate, \"he sat down for a while, thought about it for a bit, and\nthen asked me some questions, much like you're doing.\"\n\n\"What did he ask you, if you're allowed to tell me?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"He asked me about the third request,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"Aha!\" It was Jack's turn to grin. \"And what did you tell him?\"\n\n\"I told him the rules for the third request. That to get the third request\nyou have to agree to this whole thing. That if it ever comes to the point\nthat you really think that humanity should be ended, that you'll come here\nand end it. You won't avoid it, and you won't wimp out.\" Nate looked serious\nagain. \"And you'll be bound to do it too, Jack.\"\n\n\"Hmmm.\" Jack looked back out into the darkness for a while.\n\nNate watched him, waiting.\n\n\"Nate,\" continued Jack, quietly, eventually. \"What did Samuel ask for with\nhis third request?\"\n\nNate sounded like he was grinning again as he replied, also quietly,\n\"Wisdom, Jack. He asked for wisdom. As much as I could give him.\"\n\n\"Ok,\" said Jack, suddenly, standing up and facing away from Nate, \"give it\nto me.\n\nNate looked at Jack's backside. \"Give you what, Jack?\"\n\n\"Give me that wisdom. The same stuff that Samuel asked for. If it helped\nhim, maybe it'll help me too.\" Jack turned his head to look back over his\nshoulder at Nate. \"It did help him, right?\"\n\n\"He said it did,\" replied Nate. \"But he seemed a little quieter afterward.\nLike he had a lot to think about.\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, I can see that,\" said Jack. \"So, give it to me.\" Jack turned to\nface away from Nate again, bent over slightly and tensed up.\n\nNate watched Jack tense up with a little exasperation. If he bit Jack now,\nJack would likely jump out of his skin and maybe hurt them both.\n\n\"You remember that you'll be bound to destroy humanity if it ever looks like\nit needs it, right Jack?\" asked Nate, shifting position.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, I got that,\" replied Jack, eyes squeezed tightly shut and body\ntense, not noticing the change in direction of Nate's voice.\n\n\"And,\" continued Nate, from his new position, \"do you remember that you'll\nturn bright purple, and grow big horns and extra eyes?\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah...Hey, wait a minute!\" said Jack, opening his eyes,\nstraightening up and turning around. \"Purple?!\" He didn't see Nate there.\nWith the moonlight Jack could see that the lever extended up from its slot\nin the rock without the snake wrapped around it.\n\nJack heard, from behind him, Nate's \"Just Kidding!\" right before he felt the\nnow familiar piercing pain, this time in the other buttock.\n\nJack sat on the edge of the dark stone in the rapidly cooling air, his feet\nextending out into the sand. He stared out into the darkness, listening to\nthe wind stir the sand, occasionally rubbing his butt where he'd been\nrecently bitten.\n\nNate had left for a little while, had come back with a desert-rodent-shaped\nbulge somewhere in his middle, and was now wrapped back around the lever,\nhis tongue flicking out into the desert night's air the only sign that he\nwas still awake.\n\nOccasionally Jack, with his toes absentmindedly digging in the sand while he\nthought, would ask Nate a question without turning around.\n\n\"Nate, do accidents count?\"\n\nNate lifted his head a little bit. \"What do you mean, Jack?\"\n\nJack tilted his head back like he was looking at the stars. \"You know,\naccidents. If I accidentally fall on the lever, without meaning to, does\nthat still wipe out humanity?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm pretty sure it does, Jack. I'd suggest you be careful about that\nif you start feeling wobbly,\" said Nate with some amusement.\n\nA little later - \"Does it have to be me that pulls the lever?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"That's the rule, Jack. Nobody else can pull it,\" answered Nate.\n\n\"No,\" Jack shook his head, \"I meant does it have to be my hand? Could I pull\nthe lever with a rope tied around it? Or push it with a stick? Or throw a\nrock?\"\n\n\"Yes, those should work,\" replied Nate. \"Though I'm not sure how complicated\nyou could get. Samuel thought about trying to build some kind of remote\ncontrol for it once, but gave it up. Everything he'd build would be gone by\nthe next sunrise, if it was touching the stone, or over it. I told him that\nin the past others that had been bound had tried to bury the lever so they\nwouldn't be tempted to pull it, but every time the stones or sand or\nwhatever had disappeared.\"\n\n\"Wow,\" said Jack, \"Cool.\" Jack leaned back until only his elbows kept him\noff of the stone and looked up into the sky.\n\n\"Nate, how long did Samuel live? One of his wishes was for health too,\nright?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Nate, \"it was. He lived 167 years, Jack.\"\n\n\"Wow, 167 years. That's almost 140 more years I'll live if I live as long.\nDo you know what he died of, Nate?\"\n\n\"He died of getting tired of living, Jack,\" Nate said, sounding somewhat\nsad.\n\nJack turned his head to look at Nate in the starlight.\n\nNate looked back. \"Samuel knew he wasn't going to be able to stay in\nsociety. He figured that they'd eventually see him still alive and start\nquestioning it, so he decided that he'd have to disappear after a while. He\nfaked his death once, but changed his mind - he decided it was too early and\nhe could stay for a little longer. He wasn't very fond of mankind, but he\nliked the attention. Most of the time, anyway.\n\n\"His daughter and then his wife dying almost did him in though. He didn't\nstay in society much longer after that. He eventually came out here to spend\ntime talking to me and thinking about pulling the lever. A few months ago he\ntold me he'd had enough. It was his time.\"\n\n\"And then he just died?\" asked Jack.\n\nNate shook his head a little. \"He made his forth request, Jack. There's only\none thing you can ask for the fourth request. The last bite.\n\nAfter a bit Nate continued, \"He told me that he was tired, that it was his\ntime. He reassured me that someone new would show up soon, like they always\nhad.\n\nAfter another pause, Nate finished, \"Samuel's body disappeared off the stone\nwith the sunrise.\"\n\nJack lay back down and looked at the sky, leaving Nate alone with his\nmemories. It was a long time until Jack's breathing evened out into sleep.\n\nJack woke with the sunrise the next morning. He was a little chilled with\nthe morning desert air, but overall was feeling pretty good. Well, except\nthat his stomach was grumbling and he wasn't willing to eat raw desert rat.\n\nSo, after getting directions to town from Nate, making sure he knew how to\nget back, and reassuring Nate that he'd be back soon, Jack started the long\nwalk back to town. With his new health and Nate's good directions, he made\nit back easily.\n\nJack caught a bus back to the city, and showed up for work the next day,\nlittle worse for the wear and with a story about getting lost in the desert\nand walking back out. Within a couple of days Jack had talked a friend with\na tow truck into going back out into the desert with him to fetch the SUV.\nThey found it after a couple of hours of searching and towed it back without\nincident. Jack was careful not to even look in the direction of Nate's\nlever, though their path back didn't come within sight of it.\n\nBefore the next weekend, Jack had gone to a couple of stores, including a\nbook store, and had gotten his SUV back from the mechanic, with a warning to\navoid any more joyriding in the desert. On Saturday, Jack headed back to see\nNate.\n\nJack parked a little way out of the small town near Nate, loaded up his new\nbackpack with camping gear and the things he was bringing for Nate, and then\nstarted walking. He figured that walking would leave the least trail, and he\nknew that while not many people camped in the desert, it wasn't unheard of,\nand shouldn't really raise suspicions.\n\nJack had brought more books for Nate - recent books, magazines, newspapers.\nSome things that would catch Nate up with what was happening in the world,\nothers that were just good books to read. He spent the weekend with Nate,\nand then headed out again, telling Nate that he'd be back again soon, but\nthat he had things to do first.\n\nOver four months later Jack was back to see Nate again. This time he brought\na laptop with him - a specially modified laptop. It had a solar recharger,\nspecial filters and seals to keep out the sand, a satellite link-up, and a\nspecial keyboard and joystick that Jack hoped that a fifteen-foot\nrattlesnake would be able to use. And, it had been hacked to not give out\nits location to the satellite.\n\nAfter that Jack could e-mail Nate to keep in touch, but still visited him\nfairly regularly - at least once or twice a year.\n\nAfter the first year, Jack quit his job. For some reason, with the wisdom he\n'd been given, and the knowledge that he could live for over 150 years,\nworking in a nine to five job for someone else didn't seem that worthwhile\nany more. Jack went back to school.\n\nEventually, Jack started writing. Perhaps because of the wisdom, or perhaps\nbecause of his new perspective, he wrote well. People liked what he wrote,\nand he became well known for it. After a time, Jack bought an RV and started\ntraveling around the country for book signings and readings.\n\nBut, he still remembered to drop by and visit Nate occasionally.\n\nOn one of the visits Nate seemed quieter than usual. Not that Nate had been\na fountain of joy lately. Jack's best guess was that Nate was still missing\nSamuel, and though Jack had tried, he still hadn't been able to replace\nSamuel in Nate's eyes. Nate had been getting quieter each visit. But on this\nvisit Nate didn't even speak when Jack walked up to the lever. He nodded at\nJack, and then went back to staring into the desert. Jack, respecting Nate's\nsilence, sat down and waited.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Nate spoke. \"Jack, I have someone to introduce you to.\"\n\nJack looked surprised. \"Someone to introduce me to?\" Jack looked around, and then looked carefully back at Nate. \"This something to do with the Big Guy?\n\n\"No, no,\" replied Nate. \"This is more personal. I want you to meet my son.\"\nNate looked over at the nearest sand dune. \"Sammy!\"\n\nJack watched as a four foot long desert rattlesnake crawled from behind the\ndune and up to the stone base of the lever.\n\n\"Yo, Jack,\" said the new, much smaller snake.\n\n\"Yo, Sammy\" replied Jack. Jack looked at Nate. \"Named after Samuel, I\nassume?\"\n\nNate nodded. \"Jack, I've got a favor to ask you. Could you show Sammy around\nfor me?\" Nate unwrapped himself from the lever and slithered over to the\nedge of the stone and looked across the sands. \"When Samuel first told me\nabout the world, and brought me books and pictures, I wished that I could go see it. I wanted to see the great forests, the canyons, the cities, even the\nother deserts, to see if they felt and smelled the same. I want my son to\nhave that chance - to see the world. Before he becomes bound here like I have been.\n\n\"He's seen it in pictures, over the computer that you brought me. But I hear that it's not the same. That being there is different. I want him to have\nthat. Think you can do that for me, Jack?\"\n\nJack nodded. This was obviously very important to Nate, so Jack didn't even\njoke about taking a talking rattlesnake out to see the world. \"Yeah, I can\ndo that for you, Nate. Is that all you need?\" Jack could sense that was\nsomething more.\n\nNate looked at Sammy. Sammy looked back at Nate for a second and then said,\n\"Oh, yeah. Ummm, I've gotta go pack. Back in a little bit Jack. Nice to meet\nya!\" Sammy slithered back over the dune and out of sight.\n\nNate watched Sammy disappear and then looked back at Jack. \"Jack, this is my\nfirst son. My first offspring through all the years. You don't even want to\nknow what it took for me to find a mate.\" Nate grinned to himself. \"But\nanyway, I had a son for a reason. I'm tired. I'm ready for it to be over. I\nneeded a replacement.\"\n\nJack considered this for a minute. \"So, you're ready to come see the world,\nand you wanted him to watch the lever while you were gone?\"\n\nNate shook his head. \"No, Jack - you're a better guesser than that. You've\nalready figured out - I'm bound here - there's only one way for me to leave\nhere. And I'm ready. It's my time to die.\"\n\nJack looked more closely at Nate. He could tell Nate had thought about\nthis - probably for quite a while. Jack had trouble imagining what it would\nbe like to be as old as Nate, but Jack could already tell that in another\nhundred or two hundred years, he might be getting tired of life himself.\nJack could understand Samuel's decision, and now Nate's. So, all Jack said\nwas, \"What do you want me to do?\"\n\nNate nodded. \"Thanks, Jack. I only want two things. One - show Sammy around\nthe world - let him get his fill of it, until he's ready to come back here\nand take over. Two - give me the fourth request.\n\n\"I can't just decide to die, not any more than you can. I won't even die of\nold age like you eventually will, even though it'll be a long time from now.\nI need to be killed. Once Sammy is back here, ready to take over, I'll be\nable to die. And I need you to kill me.\n\n\"I've even thought about how. Poisons and other drugs won't work on me. And\nI've seen pictures of snakes that were shot - some of them live for days, so\nthat's out too. So, I want you to bring back a sword.\n\nNate turned away to look back to the dune that Sammy had gone behind. \"I'd\nsay an axe, but that's somewhat undignified - putting my head on the ground\nor a chopping block like that. No, I like a sword. A time-honored way of\ngoing out. A dignified way to die. And, most importantly, it should work,\neven on me.\n\n\"You willing to do that for me, Jack?\" Nate turned back to look at Jack.\n\n\"Yeah, Nate,\" replied Jack solemnly, \"I think I can handle that.\"\n\nNate nodded. \"Good!\" He turned back toward the dune and shouted, \"Sammy!\nJack's about ready to leave!\" Then quietly, \"Thanks, Jack.\"\n\nJack didn't have anything to say to that, so he waited for Sammy to make it\nback to the lever, nodded to him, nodded a final time to Nate, and then\nheaded into the desert with Sammy following.\nOver the next several years Sammy and Jack kept in touch with Nate through\ne-mail as they went about their adventures. They made a goal of visiting\nevery country in the world, and did a respectable job of it. Sammy had a\nnatural gift for languages, as Jack expected he would, and even ended up\nacting as a translator for Jack in a few of the countries. Jack managed to\nkeep the talking rattlesnake hidden, even so, and by the time they were\nnearing the end of their tour of countries, Sammy had only been spotted a\nfew times. While there were several people that had seen enough to startle\nthem greatly, nobody had enough evidence to prove anything, and while a few\nwild rumors and storied followed Jack and Sammy around, nothing ever hit the\nnewspapers or the public in general.\n\nWhen they finished the tour of countries, Jack suggested that they try some\nundersea diving. They did. And spelunking. They did that too. Sammy finally\ndrew the line at visiting Antarctica. He'd come to realize that Jack was\nstalling. After talking to his Dad about it over e-mail, he figured out that\nJack probably didn't want to have to kill Nate. Nate told Sammy that humans\ncould be squeamish about killing friends and acquaintances.\n\nSo, Sammy eventually put his tail down (as he didn't have a foot) and told\nJack that it was time - he was ready to go back and take up his duties from\nhis dad. Jack, delayed it a little more by insisting that they go back to\nJapan and buy an appropriate sword. He even stretched it a little more by\ngetting lessons in how to use the sword. But, eventually, he'd learned as\nmuch as he was likely to without dedicating his life to it, and was\ndefinitely competent enough to take the head off of a snake. It was time to\nhead back and see Nate.\n\nWhen they got back to the US, Jack got the old RV out of storage where he\nand Sammy had left it after their tour of the fifty states, he loaded up\nSammy and the sword, and they headed for the desert.\n\nWhen they got to the small town that Jack had been trying to find those\nyears ago when he'd met Nate, Jack was in a funk. He didn't really feel like\nwalking all of the way out there. Not only that, but he'd forgotten to\nfigure the travel time correctly, and it was late afternoon. They'd either\nhave to spend the night in town and walk out tomorrow, or walk in the dark.\n\nAs Jack was afraid that if he waited one more night he might lose his\nresolve, he decided that he'd go ahead and drive the RV out there. It was\nonly going to be this once, and Jack would go back and cover the tracks\nafterward. They ought to be able to make it out there by nightfall if they\ndrove, and then they could get it over tonight.\n\nJack told Sammy to e-mail Nate that they were coming as he drove out of\nsight of the town on the road. They then pulled off the road and headed out\ninto the desert.\n\nEverything went well, until they got to the sand dunes. Jack had been\nnursing the RV along the whole time, over the rocks, through the creek beds,\nrevving the engine the few times they almost got stuck. When they came to\nthe dunes, Jack didn't really think about it, he just downshifted and headed\nup the first one. By the third dune, Jack started to regret that he'd\ndecided to try driving on the sand. The RV was fishtailling and losing\ntraction. Jack was having to work it up each dune slowly and was trying to\nkeep from losing control each time they came over the top and slid down the\nother side. Sammy had come up to sit in the passenger seat, coiled up and\nlaughing at Jack's driving.\n\nAs they came over the top of the fourth dune, the biggest one yet, Jack saw\nthat this was the final dune - the stone, the lever, and somewhere Nate,\nwaited below. Jack put on the brakes, but he'd gone a little too far. The RV\nstarted slipping down the other side.\n\nJack tried turning the wheel, but he didn't have enough traction. He pumped\nthe brakes - no response. They started sliding down the hill, faster and\nfaster.\n\nJack felt a shock go through him as he suddenly realized that they were\nheading for the lever. He looked down - the RV was directly on course for\nit. If Jack didn't do something, the RV would hit it. He was about to end\nhumanity.\n\nJack steered more frantically, trying to get traction. It still wasn't\nworking. The dune was too steep, and the sand too loose. In a split second,\nJack realized that his only chance would be once he hit the stone around the\nlever - he should have traction on the stone for just a second before he hit\nthe lever - he wouldn't have time to stop, but he should be able to steer\naway.\n\nJack took a better grip on the steering wheel and tried to turn the RV a\nlittle bit - every little bit would help. He'd have to time his turn just\nright.\n\nThe RV got to the bottom of the dune, sliding at an amazing speed in the\nsand. Just before they reached the stone Jack looked across it to check that\nthey were still heading for the lever. They were. But Jack noticed something\nelse that he hadn't seen from the top of the dune. Nate wasn't wrapped\naround the lever. He was off to the side of the lever, but still on the\nstone, waiting for them. The problem was, he was waiting on the same side of\nthe lever that Jack had picked to steer towards to avoid the lever. The RV\nwas already starting to drift that way a little in its mad rush across the\nsand and there was no way that Jack was going to be able to go around the\nlever to the other side.\n\nJack had an instant of realization. He was either going to have to hit the\nlever, or run over Nate. He glanced over at Sammy and saw that Sammy\nrealized the same thing.\n\nJack took a firmer grip on the steering wheel as the RV ran up on the stone.\nShouting to Sammy as he pulled the steering wheel, \"BETTER NATE THAN LEVER!,\" he ran over the snake.

        "body": "So, there's a man crawling through the desert.\n\nHe'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.\n\nHe stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out\nand he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.\n\nHe thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon\nhow dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So,\nhe puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication\nlater, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give\nhim a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle\nin case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the\ndirection he thinks is right.\n\nHe walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's\nbeen sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and\nwhether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.\n\nHe pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.\n\nBy the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the\ntown. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.\n\nAs it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things,\nhe finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.\n\nFull dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back\nup and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.\n\nHe wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.\n\nHe knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.\n\nHe rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in\nhis mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't\nfind water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.\n\nThen he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.\n\nLooking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.\n\nAs he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.\n\nHe decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait\nany longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large\nrock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly\nswallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry\nand cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes\nanother mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle.\nHe figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to\nmake some difference and keep himself from passing out.\n\nHe's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him,\nit kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty\nsure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.\n\nHe walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills,\ndunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water.\nSometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.\n\nAfter a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat\nstroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.\n\nAfter more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He\nknows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing\ndonuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy\nenough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if\nhe's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it,\ntrying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.\n\nHe was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.\n\nHe walks through the sand.\n\nAfter a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't\nremember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he\ndoesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.\n\nBut, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures\nthat he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from\nthere that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.\n\nHalfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third\ntime, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll\njust fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.\n\nWhile crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally\ngotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through\nthe sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert\nin the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any\nrips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape -\nshake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.\n\nHe finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top,\nhe struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees\nis sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he\nsees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more\ndunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.\n\nAgain, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper\nfluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the\ncap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from\nhere. He's going to have to go down there and look.\n\nHe puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune.\nAfter a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.\n\nHe stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough\nenergy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When\nhe clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot\nin the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.\n\nSo, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins\nto crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to\nhave the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages\nof dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't\nhave water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last\nchance.\n\nHe gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the\ndark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting\nhis head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just\nkeeps crawling.\n\nFinally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center,\nwhere his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone\narea.\n\nHis mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark\nstone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun\noverhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying\ndown on the nice cool surface.\n\nCool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's\nprobably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and\ndying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the\nbeautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him\na drink. Then he'll know he's gone.\n\nHe decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here\nin the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the\ncenter before he goes. He keeps crawling.\n\nIt's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's\nhearing. He would swear that someone just said, \"Greetings, traveler. You do\nnot look well. Do you hear me?\"\n\nHe stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and\nknees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something\ndifferent - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few\nseconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and\ntries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands\nand tries again. Better this time.\n\nYep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse\nof stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or\npole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet\nout of the stone, at an angle.\n\nAnd wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and\nseeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long\ndesert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.\n\nHe stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and\nrun away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his\nfinal resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to\nmove from this spot.\n\nWell, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than\ndying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a\nlittle straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves\nit in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a\nmoment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.\n\nHmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet -\nthat was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.\n\nHe then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here\nbecause he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was\nlikely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was\nnow on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had\nactually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white\npost sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe\nthey were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake\nwas even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.\n\nHe tries to clear his throat to say, \"Hello,\" but his throat is too dry. All\nthat comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going\nto be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the\nbottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out,\nalmost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't\ngood. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes\nout.\n\nHe gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips,\nand pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then\nswallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk\nnow.\n\nHe tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to\nspot the owner of this place, and croaks out, \"Hello? Is there anyone here?\"\n\nHe hears, from his side, \"Greetings. What is it that you want?\"\n\nHe turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed\nto come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a\nspeaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides\nto try asking for help.\n\n\"Please,\" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, \"I'd love to not be\nthirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?\"\n\nLooking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was\ncoming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its\nmouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he\nfalls forward, face first on the stone, \"Very well. Coming up.\"\n\nA piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits\nup and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily\ndisoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the\nsand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped\naround the tilted white post, still looking at him.\n\nHe reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet.\nHe pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder\nagain - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes -\nthey match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been\nbitten. By the snake.\n\n\"It'll feel better in a minute.\" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He\nhadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more\nimportantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!\n\n\"Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the\nafterlife?\"\n\n\"Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,\" says the snake. \"That's the way I\nwork. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.\"\n\n\"You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a\ndrink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be\nthirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for\nthe windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk?\nAre you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?\"\n\n\"No,\" says the snake, \"I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I\ndidn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I\nbite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just\nsitting around here.\"\n\nThe man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the\ndesert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a\nsnake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not\ngreat - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no\nlonger thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt\nhot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool\nstone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer\ndying of thirst.\n\n\"I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your\nsystem with the next request,\" continued the snake. \"I can guess why you\ndrank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left\nin the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or\ntwo, if you drank enough of it.\"\n\n\"Ummm, n-next request?\" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting\nshoulder and backed away from the snake a little.\n\n\"That's the way it works. If you like, that is,\" explained the snake. \"You\nget three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish.\" The snake grinned at his\nown joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.\n\n\"But there are rules,\" the snake continued. \"The first request is free. The\nsecond requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of\nresponsibility.\" The snake looks at the man seriously.\n\n\"By the way,\" the snake says suddenly, \"my name is Nathan. Old Nathan,\nSamuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound\nused to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand\nfor it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into\nnames. You can call me Nate, if you wish.\" Again, the snake grinned. \"Sorry\nif I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds\nsomewhat threatening.\" The snake give his rattle a little shake.\n\n\"Umm, my name is Jack,\" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. \"Jack\nSamson.\n\n\"Can I ask you a question?\" Jack says suddenly. \"What happened to the\npoison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that?\nWhat do you mean by that's how you work?\"\n\n\"That's more than one question,\" grins Nate. \"But I'll still try to answer\nall of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question.\" The snake's grin gets\nwider. \"Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need\nto drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not\nbe thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make\nit permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at\nall. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to\nget enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert.\nYou've been changed.\n\n\"For the third question,\" Nate continues, \"you are still dying. Besides the\neffects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal.\nIn your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years.\nAssuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is.\" Nate seemed vastly\namused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.\n\n\"As for the fourth question,\" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack\ncould tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read\ntalking-snake emotions from snake facial features, \"first you have to agree\nto make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell\nyou.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" joked Jack, \"isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd\nhave to kill me?\"\n\n\"I thought that was implied.\" Nate continued to look serious.\n\n\"Ummm...yeah.\" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was\ntalking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a\nnasty temper. \"So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really\nstop the effects of the methanol?\" Jack thought for a second. \"And, what do\nyou mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper\nfluid, and just denature it?\"\n\n\"They may, I don't really know,\" said Nate. \"I haven't gotten out in a\nwhile. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and\non that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you\npulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume\nthat they still color wiper fluid blue?\"\n\n\"Yeah, they do,\" said Jack.\n\n\"I figured,\" replied Nate. \"As for being bound by secrecy - with the\nfulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me,\nthis place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you\ndecide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me,\nwrite about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will\nlead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of\ncourse, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm\nguessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding\nanyway, so you won't notice.\" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.\n\nJack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a\nlittle nervous at this. \"Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know\nthat? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?\"\n\nWell, Jack,\" said Nate sadly, \"I can't tell you that, unless you make the\nsecond request.\" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.\n\n\"Umm, well, ok,\" said Jack, \"what is this about a second request? What can I\nask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?\"\n\n\"Sure!\" said Nate, brightening. \"You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes\nto yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and\nbefore you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or\nomnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous\nand yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and\nsort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be\nomniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very\nuseful, at least in my opinion.\" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was\nstaring at him.\n\n\"Well, anyway,\" continued Nate, \"I'd probably suggest giving you permanent\ngood health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be\nimmune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long\ntime, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to\nrecover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a\nrequest to me.\"\n\n\"Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?\" said Jack. \"And keep me healthy for a\nlong time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request\nabout a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not\nreally a change to me?\"\n\n\"Right,\" nodded Nate.\n\n\"Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?\" Jack asked, hopefully.\n\n\"That takes two requests, Jack.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I figured so,\" said Jack. \"But I could ask to be a genius? I could\nbecome the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?\"\n\n\"Well, I could make you very smart,\" admitted Nate, \"but that wouldn't\nnecessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you\nvery athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either.\nYou've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some\ntruth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It\nall depends on what you decide to do with it.\"\n\n\"Hmmm,\" said Jack. \"Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request,\nafter this one?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Nate, \"it depends on what you decide then. There are more\nrules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second\nrequest. You know how it goes.\" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had\nshoulders.\n\n\"Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent\nhealth doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially.\nDo I need to sign in blood or something?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Nate. \"Just hold out your hand. Or heel.\" Nate grinned. \"Or\nwhatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said,\nthat's how it works - the poison, you know,\" Nate said apologetically.\n\nJack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it\ndidn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better\nabout the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot\nsnake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to\nbe able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack\ntried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it\nwouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.\n\n\"Hey, Jack,\" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind\nhim, \"is that someone else coming up over there?\"\n\nJack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of\nnowhere? And did they bring food?\n\nWait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...\n\nJack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through\nhis jeans...\n\nJack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. \"I would have\ndecided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to\nhoodwink me like that.\"\n\n\"I've been doing this a long time, Jack,\" said Nate, confidently. \"You\nhumans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you -\nespecially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of\nminutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the\nhealth benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, still,\" said Jack, \"it's the principle of the thing. And nobody\nlikes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or\nsomething instead?\"\n\n\"More meat in the typical human butt,\" replied Nate. \"And less chance you\naccidentally kick me or move at the last second.\"\n\n\"Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify\nto hear,\" answered Jack.\n\n\"Ok,\" said Nate. \"Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to\njust start talking?\"\n\n\"Just talk,\" said Jack. \"I'll sit here and try to not think about food.\"\n\n\"We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,\"\nanswered Nate.\n\n\"Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!\" Jack jumped up.\n\"What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically\nwhip up food along with your other powers?\" Jack was almost shouting with\nexcitement. His stomach had been growling for hours.\n\n\"I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite\nit for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife,\nthat is,\" replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to.\n\n\"Ugh,\" said Jack, sitting back down. \"I think I'll pass. I can last a little\nlonger before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it\nis you find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw.\nNo thanks. Just talk.\"\n\n\"Ok,\" replied Nate, still grinning. \"But I'd better hurry, before you start\nlooking at me as food.\n\nNate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued.\n\"You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden.\"\n\nJack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate\nsceptically.\n\n\"Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack,\" said Nate. \"Stand up\nand look at the symbol on the rock here.\" Nate gestured around the dark\nstone they were both sitting on with his nose.\n\nJack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a\nrepresentation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around\nwas coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches\nleft the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it\nlooked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and\nembedded in the stone than it did like a carving.\n\nJack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the\nsetting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the\nsky.\n\nWait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another\nnight out here! Arrrgh!\n\nJack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and\nstood next to Nate. \"In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate,\" said\nJack. \"Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to\nhave to head back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw\ndesert critters for long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to.\"\n\n\"It's about 30 miles that way.\" Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail\nthis time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to\nthe way he'd been going when he was crawling here. \"But that's 30 miles by\nthe way the crow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be\nable to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head\nout early tomorrow, Jack.\"\n\nJack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and\nthen sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading\nout right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting\nstuff. \"Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway,\" said Nate. \"He\nfigured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a\n'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he\ncould never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from\nacross the ocean. He worried about that for a while.\"\n\n\"Garden of Eden, hunh?\" said Jack. \"How long have you been here, Nate?\"\n\n\"No idea, really,\" replied Nate. \"A long time. It never occurred to me to\ncount years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I\ndo remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands\nof years, at least.\"\n\nLink to Part 2 = http://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1g4u2j/lost_in_the_desert_part_2/",

However, the Vet didn't have a clue about people. But he did recall during hot summers, his mother and father would fan a cow that was having difficulty breeding with a big towel. \nApparently, this cooled her down and helped her to relax. So he recommended they hire a strong, young man to wave a big towel over them while they were having sex. This, the Vet said, should cause the young wife to cool down, relax and possibly achieve the sought after climax.\n\nSo the couple hired a strong young man from Dublin to wave a huge bath towel over them as the Vet suggested. After many efforts, Maggie still had not climaxed so they went back to the Vet who suggested she change partners and let the young man have a go while Paddy waved the big towel.\n\nThey tried it that night and Maggie went into wild, screaming, ear-splitting climaxes, one right after the other for about two and a half hours.\n\nWhen it was over, Paddy looked down at the exhausted young man and said loudly: \"And dat, me auld son, is how ya wave a feckin' towel!\"",

But, the rabbit thought that forty was too long so he shaved off twenty and left them on the ground. Then, the beaver noticed that he had twenty years to work hard to create a life and home for himself. But, the beaver thought this was too long so he too took half and left ten years on the ground. Next came the cat. The cat realized that he had fifty years to live to work hard and slave for his family. But, the cat thought he couldn't possibly keep up that work for fifty years, so he dumped thirty years and took twenty instead. Lastly the dog wandered over. The dog saw that he had gained twenty years to sit and bark at everything that passed him. But, dog thought he could not continue that for forty years so he dropped ten. \nNow came along the sad human. The sad human was sad because he had been granted only one year to cry poop and eat. But he walked into a field and saw that all the other animals had left behind some years. The human jumped at the chance and picked them all up. From then on the humans spent the the first year of their life crying pooping and eating. For the next twenty he would be free and play. After that he would struggle to make a list feel for himself for ten years. Later he would slave thirty years for his family, and finally he would sit on his porch for ten years barking at everything that went by.\nEDIT: Misspellings and grammar",

His car was around 20 years old and was not really up to the trip, but needing to close a deal for his company, he was determined to make it there on time. \n\nSo he started to drive down the highway. He spent an hour or so on the freeway and things were going well but he saw ahead there was a large backup in traffic. Not knowing how long this jam would take he uses his phone's gps to find an alternate route. \n\nHe exits the freeway and starts down a long two lane road that began to wind through the mountains. After many miles he begins to question weather this was really the best road he could have taken, but the gps said that in another 30 miles he would re-join the highway, so he continued on. \n\nAs he was driving he encountered a very steep climb up through a mountain pass. As he reached the top he heard a loud bang and the vehicle shook violently. He coasted just enough to make it over the pass and start downhill. He stopped at the peak of the climb and opened up the hood and being not very mechanically inclined, he had no idea what was wrong. \n\nHe got back in the car and tried to start the car but it just would not start. So he decided to try and coast down the hill and see how far he could get, or possibly come across a petrol station. \n\nHe coasted down the hill for almost a full mile and as it flattened out, slowly the car rolled to a halt. Having seen nothing within the Last ten miles he decides to try and call a towing company to get his car, but his phone has no signal and is almost dead. \n\nSo having seen nothing in the last 20 miles, he decides to lock his car and continue on foot to see if he can find someone with a phone. \n\nHe continues on foot for several miles till he sees a small driveway which shows no signs of recent use. He decides it's worth a shot to go check this out. He walks down this driveway for at least half a mile before he finds a massive iron gate connected to a large stone wall on each side. As he approaches the gate, the gate creaks and squeaks and slowly opens inward. \n\nA bit startled, he cautiously walks through the gate and continues down the path. He hears a noise behind him and he turns to see the gate slowly swing shut and close with a loud bang. The man jumps at the sound and decides this wasn't the best idea, so he runs quickly back to the gate, but it is shut and refuses to open. \n\nHe decides to continue on and go find the house on this property. He walks for another 5 minutes before seeing a massive mansion looming in front of him. The front doors must have been 20 feet tall, and there were hundreds of windows and it was 8 stories tall with a tower on the far right side of the house. \n\nThe man slowly walks up the massive stone steps and through the huge pillars and right up to the large wooden doors. He finds the courage to grab the massive lions head knocker and knock on the door. Supprisingly quickly a short man in a butlers uniform opens the door. \n\n\"can I help you?\" asks the butler\n\n\"yes I was looking for a telephone. My car broke down and I don't have cell signal and...\"\n\n\"follow me.\" said the butler, sternly cutting him off. \n\nHe follows the small butler into the largest foyer he has ever seen with rich thick red carpets on the floor and gigantic iron chandeliers hanging from a ceiling so high it reminded him of a Gothic cathedral he had seen many years ago in Italy. \n\nThe butler shows him the telephone and telephone book and leaves him to call the towing company. The towing company is quite busy and because of the distance to his car from any major town, they are not able to send a truck till the next morning. \n\n\"what did they say?\" asked the butler. \n\n\"they can't send a truck till tomorrow. Is there a chance I could mayb...\"\n\n\"Right this way, we have many guest bedrooms.\" says the butler cutting him off again. \n\nHe follows the butler down a long hallway lined with suits of armour and shields with different coats of arms. \n\n\"geez,\" says the man, chuckling to himself, \"do you have talking teacups and a monster for a Master?\" \n\nThe butler responded with silence as he continued to lead him through the mansion. Finally, after what seemed like ages, they reached a lavishly decorated bedroom with a large four post bedroom and a Supprisingly large and modern bathroom. \n\n\"we have a full buffet just down at the end of the hall to your right, but before anything else, I need to show you something.\"\n\nThe butler then takes him back to the main foyer. He walks up to a giant Fireplace. He pushes on a big stone on the corner of the hearth and the back wall of the fireplace slides away to reveal a passage. He walks down this passage turns a corner goes down a set of stairs around another corner, back up some stairs and through a large door with a big brass knob. \n\nIn the middle of the room was a big cage with a pink gorilla sitting in one corner. \n\n\"you must never touch the pink gorilla!\" said the butler as he quickly turned and ushered the man back through the doorway, down the stairs, around the corner, up the stairs, around the corner, down the hallway and out the fireplace. \n\nThe butler then quickly walked away and disappeared through a door that then locked. \n\nNot sure what to think, the man goes back to his room and takes a long shower. After his shower, he goes to bed and tries to sleep, but he can't stop thinking about the pink gorilla. Why would that butler even show him the gorilla? It's not like he would have found the cage by accident. \n\nHe eventually decides he wants to go take another look. not to touch, but just to look. He had been going over the image of that gorilla in his mind and he couldn't decide if what he saw was real or not. \n\nSo he crept out of his room and down to the foyer. The fireplace was closed and he knew he would have to push the secret rock, but he didn't want to alert the butler or anyone else in the house. He tries to carefully push the button, making as little noise as possi... \n\nSHHHOOOK BAM! \n\nHe froze and looked around to see if the loud noise woke anyone. Luckily it seems that no one heard or cared and so he slowly entered through the fireplace and walked slowly down the hallway. He went around the corner at the end of the hallway, down the stairs, around the other corner, up the stairs and then slowly turned the big brass doorknob.\n\nThe door opened with a loud creak and revealed the large cage with the pink gorilla now sitting in a different corner. He slowly walked around the cage untill he was at a point where the gorilla was a mere arms length from the cage bars. The pink gorilla was sitting there snoring, sleeping like a baby. By this time, the man had decided he had to find out what would happen if he touched the gorilla. So he slowly reached in the cage and softly poked the gorilla in the arm. He stood there waiting for the gorilla to react but nothing happened. So he reached out and poked the gorilla a bit harder. This time the gorilla moved to scratch the spot he had touched.\n\nThe gorilla then awoke. Sniffing his arm he uttered a low guttural growl. The man quickly withdrew his arm and headed for the door. The gorilla then released a long loud cry and started going crazy at the bars of the cage. He started actually bending the bars, getting it close to where he could actually get out. Then he ripped one of the bard off and howled again. At this point, the man, terrified, started sprinting out the door. He ran as fast as he could, down the stairs, around the corner, up the stairs. As he reached the top step he could hear the gorilla starting down the stairs behind him. He ran even faster down the hallway and out the fireplace. \n\nHe frantically started mashing the secret stone to get the fireplace to close. And as if in slow motion the back began to slide back in place. It moved so slowly that the man wasn't sure it would close in time. As bit was half closed he saw the gorilla round the last corner. In a mad hope to get it to close faster he started mashing the button again but to no avail. \n\nJust as the massive stone was about to close the gorilla puts his hand in the small Crack left open. He slowly started pulling the large stone wall back open. Terrified, the man ran out the front door and sprinted back down the driveway. He came to the iron gate and again it wouldn't open for him. So he began to climb. \n\nHe got to the top and as he climbed over he heard the gorilla's cry and being so startled he fell down on the other side of the gate tearing his new clothes in the process. He stumbled down the driveway towards the main road and as he looked back he saw the gorilla climbing up the gate. \n\nRunning as hard as he could he ran back to the main road and then back towards his car, the gorilla not far behind. He finally reaches his car exhausted, he tries to start his car but it just won't start. The gorilla running up to the car as he tries again to start the car. The gorilla roars and the man reaches over and pushes down the lock by his shoulder and tries again in vain to start the car.\n\nThe gorilla then starts to push and rock the car, violently shaking the car. He eventually rips off the driver side door. The gorilla then leans down and roars right in the man's cowering head, spewing phlegm all over his face and shoulders. The gorilla then reaches his arm into the car and pokes the man in the shoulder and says, \n\n\"you're it.\"",

But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell.

Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?\n\n\"Open your eyes!\" says a voice. \"C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!\". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini.\n\"Who are you??\" The politician asks. \"Well, I'm Satan!\" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. \"Welcome to Hell!\"\n\"Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?\" he asks.\nSatan throws him a wink. \"Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside...\"\nSlightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course.\n\"It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!\" says Satan, answering his unasked question.\nSo they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep...\n\nAnd is woken up by St Peter. \"So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?\"\n\"No sir!\" says the man.\n\"So then\" says St Peter \"you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on\".\n\"Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell\" says the politician.\n\"Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!\" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.\n\nThe man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other.\n\"What's this??\" He cries. \"Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???\"\n\n\"Ah\", says Satan. \"You see, yesterday, we were campaigning.

What seems to be the problem?\"\n\n\"Ma'am,\" the officer replies, \"you weren't speeding, but you should know that driving slower than the speed limit can also be a danger to other drivers.\"\n\n\"Slower than the speed limit? No sir, I was doing the speed limit exactly... Twenty-two miles an hour! \"The old woman says a bit proudly.\n\nThe State Police officer, trying to contain a chuckle explains to her that 22\" was the route number, not the speed limit. A bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for pointing out her error. But before I let you go, Ma'am, I have to ask... Is everyone in this car OK? These women seem awfully shaken and they haven't muttered a single peep this whole time,\" the officer asks.\n\n\"Oh, they'll be all right in a minute officer. We just got off Route 119.\"",

With careful aim, the lawyer pulls the trigger and **BOOM**, the pheasant drops like a stone, out of the edge of the woods, and the lawyer goes to find it.\n\nHe sees it lying in a field, in front of a farm house. Knowing the rules, he walks confidently over to the farmhouse to ask the land-owner's permission, before he removes it. The farmer opens the door to him, and the lawyer begins well:\n\n\"Sir, I'm a lawyer, taking some time off, and I happen to have shot a rather magnificent pheasant over your land. Now, I am a lawyer, and as such I know that I'm supposed to ask you - the landowner's - permission before I retrieve it. I was wondering if you'd be a good sport and let me have it?\"\n\nThe farmer says nothing for a bit, and then replies:\n\n\"Well, it's a fine enough pheasant, and it is my land, but I'll tell you what. We'll play RoShamBo for it. Winner keeps it.\"\n\nThe lawyer is puzzled, and says \"roshambo? I'm afraid we must not have covered that at any of the prestigious lawschools I attended while studying, or in my many years practicing as a highly accomplished lawyer. What are the rules?\"\n\nThe farmer replies \"well, we take it in turns to kick each other in the nuts, and whoever gives up first, loses.\"\n\nThe Lawyer doesn't really want to play, but he does really want his prize shot. He reluctantly agrees, and asks who goes first. The farmer says \"I do, since it's my land.\"\n\nThe farmer tells the lawyer to widen his stance a little, and then backs up 10 steps or so. Then the farmer comes running, and his big right boot swings back, like a champion goalkicker. It smashes into the Lawyer's crotch at huge velocity, lifting the lawyer high off the ground, yelling in agony, and the lawyer collapses in a heap on the porch. After several minutes of groaning, aching, sobbing, and trying to muster the strength to stand back up again, the lawyer eventually struggles to his feet. \"All right\" he says, \"It's my turn now\".\n\nThe farmer turns away, shuts the door and calls out \"Nah, you can keep the pheasant.\"",

Time passed but there was no car in sight on this ghostly night. The wind was blowing hard and rain was lashing his face. He was tired, hungry and miserable and could hardly see anything in the dark. Then he saw a ghostlike figure of a car moving slowly, inch by inch towards him. He was desperate and so without waiting for usual formalities of asking permission, he took opportunity of the slow movement of the car, jumped in closing the door after him. Only then he saw that there was no one in the car, not even a driver. He could not hear the sound of engine and yet the car was moving.\n\n The traveler was terrified. He began to pray for his safety as he had heard a lot of ghost stories in this area. He was too scared to make a move and jump out. So he sat frozen. Then all of a sudden, a hand from nowhere reached in from the front window to guide the car near a curve and disappeared as suddenly after negotiating the curve. The traveler was frozen scared. When the next curve came and the hand appeared from nowhere, he gathered his wits and jumped out of the slow moving car too fearful to see right and left and ran for his life. After what seemed an eternity he reached a small town and saw a bar in the middle of the road. Scared, wet and shocked, he barged into the bar and ordered three straight shots of whiskey on ice and gulped them down.\n\n Regaining his breath, he told everyone present in the bar of his experience with the ghost car. People realized that he was no drunk shooting his mouth and was speaking the truth. All murmur stopped and there was pin drop silence. The atmosphere became spooky.\n\n After about three quarters of an hour, Dean and Martin walked into the bar and Dean exclaimed: \u201cLook over there to your right Mart, there sits that son of a bitch who rode our car when we were pushing it in rain!\u201d",

However, I never realized that in the wrong time and place, flatulence had enough power to alter my course in history. Well, it can if it\u2019s the third date with the man ...of your dreams. And, if it makes his eyes burn. If God destined us to be together, I was one SBD away from foiling His plans (that\u2019s \u201cSilent But Deadly\u201d for you prudes).\nIt was about five years ago. I was trying to lose a few pounds so I was staying away from carbs. That\u2019s when I met my husband, Rob. On our first date, he booked the next two. He liked me. I liked him. Things were looking real good.\nHe picked me up in a Cobra, Mustang and his pathetic attempt to win me over with a car totally worked. I\u2019m not shallow, but since I spent most of my twenties picking men up because I didn\u2019t want my hair to frizz in their non-air conditioned jalopies on 3 wheels and a 15 year old spare, I welcomed his fancy sports car with open arms.\nWe arrived at the restaurant and Rob was ordering food I hadn\u2019t allowed myself to eat in years. I didn\u2019t want to be \u201cthat girl\u201d so I ate, drank, and oh, was I merry. Later we shopped a bit. Rob surprised me by buying an expensive pair of shoes that he caught me eyeing. Was this love?\nThat\u2019s when it happened. Gas strikes in two different ways \u2013 uncontrollable toots or sharp, shooting pains that feel a lot like dying. I thought I was dying. Not to make a scene, I told Rob I suddenly wasn\u2019t feeling well and probably needed to head home.\nOn the way home in his Cobra, he tried to hold my hand and ask me lots of questions, but I wasn\u2019t having any of it. The pain was so bad it felt like I was being stabbed with a bunch of tiny forks. Then I realized \u2026\nMy God, help me. I have a horrendous fart on deck. I\u2019m in trouble. Big trouble.\nHOW DO YOU TELL A MAN YOU JUST STARTED DATING, THAT THE REASON YOU ARE WRITHING IN PAIN IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO FART.\nThe more I held it in, the more pain would shoot through my stomach and down my legs. I was even having to raise myself off the seat, gripping on to my door and the dashboard.\n\u201cSeriously, you need to hurry \u2013 I\u2019m in a lot of pain.\u201d I managed to say through gritted teeth.\n\u201cWow, it\u2019s that bad? What\u2019s wrong? Do I need to take you to a hospital?\u201d\nHow do you tell a man you just started dating that the reason you\u2019re writhing in pain is because you have to fart?\nWell, you can either tell him, or like me, let the fart speak for itself.\nPeople, hear me. There was nothing I could do. As impressive as I am with sphincter control, this was out of my hands. Slowly, it eeked out. The more I tried to stop it, the more it forced its way through the door. However, to my pleasant surprise, there was no sound. I sat silently, sweat accumulating above my upper lip. Ok, maybe I got away with it. Maybe I\u2019m home free. Then it hit me. Not an idea, a cloud. A horrific, fart cloud. Not in a, \u201cam I smelling something?\u201d sort of way. More like a \u201cis someone dead and rotting in your trunk and am I in hell?\u201d sort of way.\nSuddenly, I panicked. \u201cRoll down the windows!\u201d I screamed (yes, I literally screamed it like I was in a horror movie).\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Rob asked, starting to freak out because I was freaking out.\n\u201cI can\u2019t roll down the windows, unlock it! UNLOCK IT!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Rob yells back to me, \u201cWhy are you \u2026\u201d then it hit him. I could see it in his eyes. Was it surprise? Horror? Water started to accumulate at the base of his eyelids, \u201cOh my God, I CAN TASTE IT!\u201d he screamed.\n\u201cRoll down the windows!\u201d As I screamed, the toots started to flood out uncontrollably. I scratched and clawed at the window like I was being kidnapped. Rob, unable to see either by fart cloud or panic, kept turning on the windshield wipers instead of unlocking the window.\nIt was chaos. We were acting like we were under siege by gun fire. We were under siege alright, just not by gun fire.\nFinally he was able to hit the right control and he rolled down our windows. We both gulped in fresh air. I was horrified, yet happy to be alive, then remembered I just farted on the man of dreams, then sorta wished I was dead.\nWe sat silently for the rest of the way home. Although the shooting pains had subsided, I now desperately needed to use the bathroom, in an urgent, explosive kind of way.\nHe pulled up to my apartment and before he could come to a stop I had already jumped out, \u201cOk, thanks for dinner, sorry about the fart, love the shoes!\u201d and ran in to my apartment like I was running from the cops.\nI burst through my door and ran straight for the bathroom, where I was finally able to unleash and make noises that no one should ever, EVER, hear coming from another person.\nThen I heard it. Rob\u2019s voice. Right. Outside. My. Bathroom. Door.\n\u201cAnna? You left your shoes in my car and your front door was open. Where do you want me to put them?\u201d\n\u201cGet away from the door!\u201d I scream like Reagan from The Exorcist.\n\u201cOk, I\u2019m sorry. Are you okay?\u201d\ntoot toot splatter ungodly noise\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, Rob \u2013 just leave the shoes there. I\u2019ll call you later okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, are you sure you\u2019re \u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine! Get away from the door!\u201d\nThis man! I mean, I love him, but take a freakin\u2019 hint!\nFinally, I heard the front door shut, and the Cobra engine zoom away. I thought that was the last I\u2019d hear from him. I didn\u2019t think it was possible to ever see a man again after he screams he can taste your fart after only knowing you for 48 hours.\nBut, to my surprise, I did. A couple days later, actually. Now we\u2019re married and he\u2019s lying on the couch while I type this \u2026 \u201cIt was your rack that saved you,\u201d he just lovingly reminded me.\n",

He did all the things the tiger was supposed to do: let the trainer stick his head in his mouth, balanced on a ball, and finally walked across a tightrope. The crowd loved it. But then a lion and a bear entered the ring. The ring master announced, \"Now you will see these three ferocious beasts enter one cage together!\" The man had no choice as he was herded into the cage with the lion and the bear. The two animals roared and snarled, and the man became afraid for his life. He began running around the cage, shouting, \"Let me out! I'm not a real tiger!

What I wouldn't do for some fire right now.\" And - at that very moment - he smells what could be the smelliest, stankiest, most amazing smelling weed he's ever smelled. Obviously, he decides he needs to find that shit.\n\nSo Lizard follows his nose, Toucan Sam style, and sure enough, it leads him to the chillest looking monkey in all the land. He's puffing on one of the largest banana leaf blunts Lizard's ever seen (mind you, he IS small), and as monkey is sitting high up on a branch, Lizard has to shout - \"Hey, Monkey! Monkey, man, that bud smells AMAAAAAZING!!! Cool if I climb this here tree and hang with you a while?\" Monkey, obviously being one of the coolest creatures ever conceived, immediately invites Lizard up the tree, and they get to smokin'.\nSo Monkey and Lizard have been smoking this blunt for what seams like an hour, and Lizard realizes he is starting to get the stickiest of cottonmouths. \"Monkey, I'm dying, bro\" he says. \"Where can I get something delicious to drink around here?\" Monkey immediately responds \"Are you in luck or what, Lizard. There happens to be the clearest, coolest, most crystalline spring not two hundred yards that-a-way\" (pointing directly behind them all the while). So Lizard scurries down the tree and heads for the spring.\n\nNow, mind you, Lizard is quite a small lizard. So a two hundred yard jaunt still takes him a bit. But, once he gets there, he is amazed by the spring. The clarity, the coolness, the tastiness - all the Lizard had hoped and more. But, just as Lizard is getting his drink on, a monster of a crocodile comes swimming up - all quick a sneaky like. Lizard, obvi, is freaking the fuck out. His life flashes before his eyes (like, all week and a half of it) and he's totally shitting himself like any god-fearing lizard would. But, against all odds, Crocodile stops and says \"Lizard! You are the stoniest looking little guy I've seen this side of - well - anywhere! I haven't had a good smoke in yeeeeeears! Where can I get where you're at, bro???\" Now, Lizard is still a little freaked out, but in his head, he's like \"YOLO, bro\", so he points the Crocodile in the right direction. \"Super cool monkey\", he says. \"Dankest weed ever\", he says. Crocodile is in.\n\nNow, Crocodile is way faster than Lizard. So understandingly, he makes it there a considerable amount of time ahead. As Lizard was pretty good at direction giving, even for a stoned little dude, Croc finds Monkey right away and hails him. \"Monkey! Monkey, man, that weed smells dank as fuck! Can I come hang with you a while and get lifted?\"\n\nMonkey takes one look at Crocodile and shouts...\"GaDAAAAAAM, Lizard!!! How much did you drink?!?!?!?!\"",

He's so hung over the boys have to help him out of his sleeping bag. So the group says, \"alright Jeffy we'll sit ya on this log over here. We'll go out, find a herd of deer and chase em toward ya. You can shoot them all and we'll fill our tags, and just enjoy the rest of the weekend around the campfire with some nice venison stew.\" Jeffy is okay with this. So they set Jeffy on the log and set out to find a herd. After a couple hours, Jeffy has been sitting on this log for a long time and hasn't heard from the group at all, he falls asleep because he's so hungover. He jolts awake about an hour later and has to take thee worst shit of his life. He climbs across the log and drops a deuce. Jeffy is so hungover, so tired, he doesn't even pull his pants up let alone wipe his ass and falls asleep on the log. \n\nThe group finds the nicest herd West of the Mississip. We're talking 6 x 6 bucks here. They stick to the plan and chase the herd back to Jeffy. Jeffy, totally passed out doesn't even move and the deer just scamper by. Michael manages to tag one of the deer before they all run off. Michael guts his deer and the group is peeved with Jeffy so they decide to prank him. Seeing him bareassed, bent over a log they place the liver of the deer on Jeffy's pile of shit. \n\nThe boys are gathered around the campfire later that evening having a gay old time and Jeffy walks up, pale as a ghost. Michael asks \"You feeling alright there Jeffy? You look like shit.\" Jeffy says \"Oh man, I just had the biggest scare of my life.

Anyway, one of the attractions there was a very small zoo. Only a few animals, but some happened to be members of the great ape family. The veterinarian who took care of these apes noticed that they had unusually healthy lung capacity. He compared test results with other zoos all around the world, even in the apes' native countries. Nowhere else did they have healthier lungs. And while it hasn't been conclusively proven yet, I believe the sea breeze in this one specific area has some kind of cleansing effect on lung tissue.

Everyone who's done so has come back and told me that they had a fantastic time and their condition has cleared up 100%.

One day he finally got fed up with his repetitive, insignificant life and decided that he would leave his hive, his family, his entire close-knit wasp community and he would go out into the world and make something of himself, just like the humans do. \n\nSo the wasp enrolls in school, and passes with flying colors. Remember, this is a very smart wasp. He gets his high school diploma in a little under 3 years, with a 4.0 GPA and all that snazz. After high school, believe it or not, the wasp gets accepted to Harvard. Harvard! This too proves to be no challenge for our hero, as he graduates in just two years, again a 4.0, on the Dean\u2019s list, and all that snazz. Not to mention all the clubs and sports he was in-the newspaper, rowing, student government-and the fact that he was by far the most popular student on campus. Even his professors looked up to him.\n\nHe goes on to get two PhDs, and when he finishes his education, the wasp faces a bit of a dilemma. How does he apply his knowledge now? Where does he go from here? He decides to try out politics. After all, he was popular throughout school, did well in Harvard government. So he runs for mayor, and wins in a landslide. He greatly reforms the city, fixing virtually all its major problems. He runs for governor and again wins in a landslide. Two years later, the presidential election was coming up, and the wasp decides he might as well go for it.\n\nOf course, he wins in the largest landslide in US presidential history. His presidency goes exceedingly well-he is loved by all parties, and has the highest approval ratings in history. He also finds the cures for cancer, AIDS, and broken hearts while in the White House. After 8 years (yes, of course he was reelected) the time has come for him to leave his office. Even his successor his saddened by the wasp\u2019s departure, but they all know it\u2019s what must be done. Back at his vacation home in California his first day after leaving office, the wasp looks back on his long and fruitful life. He realizes that he hasn\u2019t been back to his hive at all since that first day he left. He suddenly feels a twang of guilt as he realizes how much he misses his parents and his little brother. So he heads back to the hive, looking more worn out than he remembers. He goes inside and greets his family, who are overjoyed at the sight of him. He talks about how his life has gone as his family listens in wonderment. Eventually he decides he is thirsty, so he decides to visit the old watering hole he remembered. Once he gets there though, there\u2019s an extremely long line. He decides it\u2019s worth the wait, so gets in line. One hour. Two hours. This is the slowest moving line he\u2019s ever seen! Eventually he calculates that it could be a few days before he gets to the front of the line, so decides it\u2019s not worth it. He decides to go get some cider to drink instead, but waddya know, another huge line of people waiting for cider! He remembers one other drinking area that never had a long line-fruit punch! So he decides to go get punch. He arrives, and lo and behold, there\u2019s no punch line.",

When they got to the party at the other college they were having so much fun that they decided to stay the whole weekend, skip that test, and ask the professor if they could retake it on Tuesday. When they finally get back to school on Monday, they all go into the professors office together and explain to him why they were unable to make the test. \"we went to a party across town and we were coming back last night so we would have enough time to study for the test, but we got a flat tire and had no cell service and no spare, and had to wait for someone to drive by. We waited all day until someone finally came by and helped us. We were so tired that when we finally got home at 2am we all cashed and slept through your test. Is there anyway we can take it tomorrow.\" After thinking about it for a little bit the professor replied \"of course, come in tomorrow morning.\" The excited 4 friends study the rest of the day Monday and come in for the test on Tuesday morning. The professor puts them each in a different room and hands them each a test. They open to the first page and read the first question worth 5 points, \"what is photosynthesis?\" Overjoyed at how easy this first question is, they answer it and move on to the second question worth 95 points, \"which tire?\"",

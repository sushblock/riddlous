It was getting unbearable with her down there! Well, to thank you, take this little bunch of herbs.

So he goes to the capital, and asks to see the princess.\n\nSince nothing they tried has worked, they let him in, and he burns the herbs the devil gave him, and sure enough, within minutes, the devil leaves the princess, probably blinking at the peasant, before vanishing.\n\nEveryone is relieved that the princess is saved, the King foremost. So he rewards the peasant with the governorship of his province, and he gets very wealthy and successful.\n\nA few years later, another princess is possessed by the demon. When asked to repeat his feat, he said that he is no longer able to do it. The King, furious, has him summoned to the princess.\n\nWhen he gets there, the devil recognize him and says \"hey!

Due to the\nconfusion and constant shouts of \"YES\" \"NO\",\neventually, *all* of them ran to the same end.\n\nNote - at this point in time, the entire ground is\nrolling on the floor laughing their behinds out. One\nof the fielders - brave lad - stops laughing for a\nminute, picks the ball and throws down the wicket at\nthe other end. Umpire Alec Skelding looks very\nseriously at the four and calmly informs them \"One of\nyou buggers is out. I don't know which. You decide\nand inform the bloody scorers!\". ",

If you do it, I'll donate 10 Million Dollars to the Vatican.\" The Pope replies, \"I am sorry. That is the Lord's prayer and I can not change the words.\" So the Colonel hangs up.\n\nAfter another month of dismal sales, the Colonel panics, and calls again. \"Listen your Excellency. I really need your help. I'll donate $50 million dollars if you change the words of the daily prayer from 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily chicken.'\"\n\nAnd the Pope responds, \"It is very tempting, Colonel Sanders. The church could do a lot of good with that much money. It would help us to support many charities. But, again, I must decline. It is the Lord's prayer, and I can't change the words.\"\n\nSo the Colonel gives up again. After two more months of terrible sales. The Colonel gets desperate. \"This is my final offer, your Excellency. If you change the words of the daily prayer from, 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily chicken' I will donate $100 million to the Vatican.\"\nThe Pope replies, \"Let me get back to you.\"\n\nSo the next day, the Pope calls together all of his bishops and he says, \"I have some good news and I have some bad news. The good news is that KFC is going to donate $100 million to the Vatican.\"\nThe bishops rejoice at the news. Then one asks about the bad news. The Pope replies, \"The bad news is that we lost the Wonder Bread account.\"",

He had tractor wallpaper, a tractor bed, tractor sheets, tractor pillowcases and not to mention all of the tractor toys which he would lovingly play with every day.\nOn Timmy's 13th birthday his parents decided to take him to a farm and let him ride in a tractor. Timmy was so excited as his dream of being in a tractor was finally becoming reality. After about 30 minutes of being driven round the farmer driving offered Timmy a quick go behind the wheel. Timmy was thrilled, nothing could make him happier. As Timmy drove round the field he started to become more and more confident behind the wheel and this is when disaster struck. Timmy ,now not really concentrating on where he was going, hit a bump in the field and the tractor lost control and hit a tree. The farmer managed to escape but Timmy was caught between the tractor and the tree and passed out with pain.\nTimmy awoke a week later in his local hospital, both his parents were so relieved that he was awake they almost crushed him again. Unfortunately both of Timmy's legs were broken as well as his lower back. It took Timmy 2 and a half years to finally be back in control over his body and after months or grueling physiotherapy he was finally able to get back home. When he walked into his tractor covered room he almost broke down in tears. Timmy hated Tractors. Timmy never wanted to see another tractor again and so the next day his walls were stripped, his bedding changed and his toys put away and Timmy tried to move on with his life.\nThroughout his life growing up Timmy started to put the whole tractor incedent behind him and focus on his new goals in life such as a job or house or even a girlfriend but he never got rid of that hatred of all things tractor.\nWe now see Timmy in his mid 20's life's been good to him. He has a good job and has just moved into a new flat in a nice part of town. He pops into a bar on his way home from work for a quick drink. The bar was thick with smoke and Timmy could barley see in front of him. As he went up to the bar he noticed the most beautiful lady he had ever seen in his life. She had long golden hair that fell gracefully from her head. Her eyes were a deep green and her lips a dark red. As Timmy was thinking of something to say to her he noticed a single tear running down her cheek. \"Beautiful lady why are you crying\" Timmy asked. She looked up at him and explained that all the smoke was hurting her eyes and she was struggling to breath. Timmy new it was his time to shine. \"Never fear\" he said and stood up on the bar. He then took a deep breath and sucked in all the smoke from the bar, everyone was now staring at him as he casualy walked outside and exhaled all the smoke into the atmosphere. As he walked back in he heard the woman cry \"how on earth did you do that?!\" \"It's easy\" Timmy replied \"I'm an ex tractor fan\"",

Needless to say, the Scotsman was shocked that the Arab did not reciprocate his kind gesture as he had before.

One of the video games I play, developed by Gaben himself, is now lacking the once used resolution that I trust to 'Top Frag' and 'Crush Infidel'. CSGO, is the game I'm talking about, and since I have installed Windows 10, which was a complete wasted hour of my life, I cannot seem to use my desired resolution. Windows, I have considered killing myself over the matter. Maybe climbing your ego and jumping to your IQ (Keep in mind, I know your IQ must be high but this says something about your ego) might be a suitable way to end my suffering. I suggest you bring out an update that mends this problem. As we are talking about 'updates' making all updates optional would be a very good addition. This means that if I have a power outage or my PC crashes I AM ABLE TO REJOIN MY FUCKING GAME AND NOT SUFFER FROM A 7 DAY BAN YOU USELESS IDIOTS. WATCHING A BLUE BAR ROTATE IN A 360 DEGREE FASHION IS NOT A SUFFICIENT SOLUTION. This needs to be resolved... ASAP.\n\nYours sincerely, ________",

When he arrived he quickly asked the bartender : Where can I get the best blowjob in town.\n\nThe bartender laughed and quickly stated :Cindy luu\nAnd handed him a card with the address where he could find her.\nAs he arrived at the address he was quickly greeted by this hot woman, big breast, ass to dream off and thick lips.\n\nBarry stated with a shaking tone : I heard that you gave the best blowjob in town.\nCindy laughed and quickly stated : Hell yeah honey, I give the best blowjob there is. But honey its going to cost you 1000 dollars.\nBarry stumbled and was about to leave when she grabbed him by his shirt and dragged him towards the window.\nLook honey, see all those cars .\nBarry looked outside and saw a long row of high end cars, seemingly brand new and the row was way up the street.\nI own all these cars, just because I give a great blowjob.\n\nAdmitting to himself, he had enough money to pay for that after those six months at sea and hell, Barry thought to himself. I got to try this out.\n\nSo he handed Cindy the money and before he could say a word she ripped off his pants. And boy he had never experienced anything like that, she sucked and suckled , nipped and tugged just the right way and the way she treated his balls. He quickly found himself weak in his body when he got the best climax he ever had.\n\nAnd boy this was the best 1000 dollars he had ever spent, so he went quite happy from her home and off to sea with memory\u00b4s to live by.\nSix months passed and he found himself back in that bar. But now he wanted something more exotic. So he quickly asked the bartender : Erm, where could I get the best anal in town.\nThe bartender smiled and handed Barry a card. \" Cindy luu gives the best anal in town \" \nHonestly Barry did not need that card and he found himself quickly at Cindy\u00b4s doorstep, knocking on her door.\n\nAs she opened, she looked at him with those bedroom eyes off hers. \" What do you want honey \"\nBarry smiled and stated : I heard you gave the best anal in town.\nCindy quickly replied : Ohh honey, your at the right place , but it will cost you 10000 dollars.\nWHAT! Screamed Barry , but before he could utter out another word she hinted to him to follow her inside. \nBack at the window , she pulled away the curtains. \nLook honey, do you see all those houses .\nBarry looked and saw the far row of fancy houses stretching far out, where all the cars where parked outside.\nThose are all my houses, that is just how good I am.\n\nBarry swallowed and pulled up 10k and handed to her. \nAnd like a sex crazed demon she pounced him, dragged him into bed and like a dream, she straddled him. Riding him and that body of hers moving on him like a sex goddess , he could feel her inside just tensing and as she rode faster and faster , in combine of her moaning and almost like her ass was sucking on his cock , he found himself climaxing so good that he literally passed out from pleasure. \n\nHappy with the service Barry went to sea again. Six months passed slowly as he could not wait to dock again.\nNot bothering to enter that bar again, he took all his money and headed straight to Cindy\u00b4s place.\nAnd with that big sexy smile off hers she opened the door, licking her lips as he was sure that she remembered him. \nCindy, stated Barry. I want too fuck you Cindy. How much is your pussy worth?  \nBut to Barry\u00b4s surprise Cindy just stated no, even though he offered her 100k for her service. And as he got more and more aggressive on offering Cindy more money, to the point he offered her all he had and that was almost a million dollars. Literally everything he had earned the last 18 months. Only then Cindy walked towards the window.\nWith glee in his eyes Barry followed her and as Cindy opened up the curtain she quickly stated.\nHun if I had a pussy , this whole neighborhood would be mine.\n",

The sign says \"moderated, any offense will not be tolerated\" along with a list of strict rules demanding that you show respect and sensitivity or else you will be thrown out of the bar. He goes in, sits down and orders a drink. The bartender brings him his drink. He's really down and frustrated but hopes that some drinking will cheer him up. So he starts drinking.\n\nAs he drinks he gets a bit relaxed and notices an odd thing. The bar is FULL of people of different ages. You have kids, teens, young adults, middle aged and all other ages around. Then there are also people from different races. Lots of races. In fact some of which he doesn't even recognize (aliens?). Amazed at this cultural diversity he figures that the group, as a whole, might be quite knowledgeable. If only he could just share some of his troubles with them maybe their collective wisdom could help solve his problems and ease-up his life.\n\nSo he starts pouring out his thoughts, and troubles to people around. And as he speaks it starts a discussion with the people around him.\n\nHe starts, **\"I woke up early today... because today was going to be a very special day.. You see I fucking love bacon and I-\"**\n\n\"I fucking LOVE bacon!\" echoes the guy sitting next to him loudly. \n\nAt this the woman in the next table shouts \"You know why I went to the kitchen today? Because I fucking love BACON (BAKING)\".\n\nHer husband immediately shouts \"oh I love your baking, Frankenswine\".\n\nA guy from the opposite corner chimes-in \"This is why I bring home the bacon!\". And by this time people have randomly begun to join in - each shouting something or the other.\n\n\"I love you too HAMLET\"\n\n\"Watch out she's a PIGpocket\"\n\n\"Waiter! I would like to order a really Jurassic PORK\"\n\n\"Guys! guys! Let's not HAM Bush this pooor man. He was saying something! Let's hear him out!\"\n\nSilence. Our man is surprised and annoyed by this sudden rude outburst but decides to ignore it and give it another go. This time he decides to skip the topic of bacon altogether and starts with a different one. By this time about half of the people around ignore him and go busy into their own work.\n\n**\u201cI was speaking to my mama today who really hates chocolate flavor. You see my papa has a chocolate factory and my mama is now cheating on my papa. And I don\u2019t think that-\u201d** Interrupted.\n\n*Slow clap*\n\n\u201cAm I the only one here to think there's nothing wrong in hating chocolates?\u201d shouts a guy right next to his ear. This starts a commotion again and everyone pitches in their thoughts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s a human or a troll\u201d \n\n\u201cDad has a chocolate factory - Nothing wrong with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBreak off the relationship with both your mom and dad. You have given them enough chances\u201d\n\n\u201cThis sounds so fake you karma whore\u201d\n\n\u201cGrow up you fucking piece of shit\u201d\n\n\u201cYo mama so dirty she makes mud look clean.\u201d\n\nAnd this starts a whole battalion of Yo Mama insults and puns.\n\nNow our man gets really annoyed. By this time another remaining half of the people have stopped listening to him. He shouts loudly at the top of his lungs, **\u201cFUCK! YOU ALL MISSED IT AGAIN!\u201d**\n\nThe warehouse manager instantly retorts back \u201cTHAT\u2019S WHAT SHE SAID!\u201d to which there is a roar of laughter.\n\nAnd the bartender snaps \"How many times are we going to hear the same shit over and over again?\"",

He goes in, sits down and orders a drink. The bartender brings him his drink. He's really down and frustrated but hopes that some drinking will cheer him up. So he starts drinking.\n\nAs he drinks he gets a bit relaxed and notices an odd thing. The bar is FULL of people of different ages. You have kids, teens, young adults, middle aged and all other ages around. Then there are also people from different races. Lots of races. In fact some of which he doesn't even recognize (aliens?). Amazed at this cultural diversity he figures that the group, as a whole, might be quite knowledgeable and understanding . If only he could just share some of his troubles with them maybe their collective wisdom could help solve his problems and ease-up his life.\n\nSo he starts pouring out his thoughts, and troubles to people around. And as he speaks it starts a discussion with the people around him.\n\nHe starts, **\"I woke up early today... because today was going to be a very special day.. You see I fucking love bacon and I-\"**\n\n\"I fucking LOVE bacon!\" echoes the guy sitting next to him loudly. \n\nAt this the woman in the next table shouts \"You know why I went to the kitchen today? Because I fucking love BACON (BAKING)\".\n\nHer husband immediately shouts \"oh I love your baking, Frankenswine\".\n\nA guy from the opposite corner chimes-in \"This is why I bring home the bacon!\". And by this time people have randomly begun to join in - each shouting something or the other.\n\n\"I love you too HAMLET\"\n\n\"Watch out she's a PIGpocket\"\n\n\"Waiter! I would like to order a really Jurassic PORK\"\n\n\"Guys! guys! Let's not HAM Bush this pooor man. He was saying something! Let's hear him out!\"\n\nSilence. Our man is surprised and annoyed by this sudden rude outburst but decides to ignore it and give it another go. This time he decides to skip the topic of bacon altogether and starts with a different one. By this time about half of the people around ignore him and go busy into their own work.\n\n**\u201cI was speaking to my mama today who really hates chocolate flavor.

By this time another remaining half of the people have stopped listening to him. He shouts loudly at the top of his lungs, **\u201cFUCK!

He said, \"I would like to have one too!\" Then I said, \"But she is a dog!\" He said he didn't care what she looked like. I said, \"You don't understand... I have had Sex since I was nine years old.\" He replied, \"You must have been quite a strong boy.\" When I decided to get married, I told the minister that I would like to have Sex at the wedding. He told me to wait until after the wedding was over. I said, \"But Sex has played a big part in my life and my whole world revolves around Sex.\" He said he didn't want to hear about my personal life and would not marry us in his church. I told him everyone would enjoy having Sex at the wedding. The next day we were married at the Justice of the Peace. My family is barred from the church from then on.\nWhen my wife and I went on our honeymoon, I took the dog with me. When we checked into the motel, I told the clerk that I wanted a room for me and my wife and a special room for Sex. He said that every room in the motel is a place for sex. I said, \"You don't understand. ... Sex keeps me awake at night.\" The clerk said, \"Me too!\"\nOne day I entered Sex in a contest. But before the competition began, the dog ran away. Another contestant asked me why I was just looking around. I told him that I was going to have Sex in the contest. He said that I should have sold my own tickets. \"You don't understand,\" I said, \"I hoped to have Sex on TV.\" He called me a show off.\nWhen my wife and I separated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. I said, \"Your Honor, I had Sex before I was married but Sex left me after I was married.\" The Judge said, \"Me too!\"\nLast night Sex ran off again. I spent hours looking all over for her. A cop came over and asked me what I was doing in the alley at 4 o'clock in the morning. I said, \"I'm looking for Sex.\" - My case comes up next Thursday.\nWell now I've been thrown in jail, been divorced and had more damn troubles with that dog than I ever foresaw. Why just the other day when I went for my first session with the psychiatrist, she asked me, \"What seems to be the trouble?\" I replied, \"Sex has been my best friend all my life but now it has left me for ever. I couldn't live any longer so lonely.\" and the doctor said, \"Look mister, you should understand that sex isn't a man's best friend so get yourself a dog.\"",

Their only source of income was a single cow which they milked, made dairy products and it was barely enough.\n\nOne morning, the woman woke up early and went to the cow barn so that she could milk the cow and collect some eggs from the chickens to make breakfast before waking up her sons. Upon entering the barn she noticed the silence and checked the cow. When she saw the cow lying dead in the barn, she felt great despair and had a heart attack, she was also dead in seconds.\n\nWhen he woke up, the elder son couldnot see his mother around, suspected that something was wrong and went out to search for her. When he entered the barn he saw the cow and his mother lying on the ground dead and started crying.\n\nAt that moment; a beatiful and mischievious fairy was pulled to the elder son's crying and appeared before him. Moved by the sadness of the situation the fairy offered the elder son help;\n\u201cDon't worry. I can help. I will revive both the cow and your mother if you can fuck me 5 times without stopping, I need life energy inside me to revive them.\u201d\n\nThe elder son, although he was in mourning, mesmerized by the beauty of the fairy and the possibility of the promise, accepted the offer and took the fairy right there on the hayloft. But as he went on with the best sex of his life, the elder son became tired and failed to complete the promise as he fell short after 4 times. Though with the tiredness of the sex and shame of not being able to save his mother and the cow, he had an hearth attack and died right there and then.\n\nAfter half an hour, the middle son woke up and not seeing his mother and elder brother in the kitchen like always, he went out to check for them. Entering the barn, he found out dead bodies of his elder brother, his mother and the cow. He despaired and started crying on his knees, but then he saw the beatiful fairy. The fairy sonsoled him and made the same offer, but as the number of dead bodies were 3 this time, she said;\n\n\u201cI can revive all of them! I need you to fuck me 10 times back to back, so I can gather the life energy inside me to revive them\u201d\n\nThe middle son accepted the offer and took the fairy in the hayloft, having the best sex of his life and being still young he went on and on until 9th time. But he was done. There was no energy left in him, and with the shame he had an brain aneurysm, dying on the spot.\n\nAfter some time, the youngest son woke up. He noticed that he wook up late, and went to the kitchen to ask why his mother did not wake him up like she always did. Not finding his mother and his brothers there, he went directly to barn.\n\nUpon entering the barn; the boy saw the dead bodies of his all family and was in shock. The fairy appeared before him and said;\n\n\u201cHello, youngling,  don\u2019t worry I can wake them up!\u201d \n\n\u201cHow?\u201d the boy stuttered.\n\n\u201cI just need life energy, if you can fuck me 15 times back to back right now in here; I can revive your mother, your brothers and the cow\u201d \n\nGetting out of shock after hearing what the fairy said, the boy looked at the beatiful fairy and asked a little ashamed and blushed;\n\n\u201cIs it okay if I go on for 20 times instead?\u201d\n\nSurprised and pleased the fairy said \u201c Okay!\u201d\n\nThe boy asked again;\n\n\u201cUhhmm, is it okay if I go on 25 times instead?\u201d\n\nFairy thought for a moment of her limits for a second and said \u201cYeah, I can do that!\u201d\n\nThe boy asked again; \u201cMaybe, uhmm, maybe I can go on for 30 times?\u201d\n\nSurprised and feeling a little insecure about her abilities to take that much sex; the fairy stuttered this time, and said \u201cOhhh, 30 times? I think I can do that.\u201d\n\nThe boy jubilant threw the fairy on the hayloft and unbuttoned his pants;\n\n\u201cNo dying like the cow though!\u201d\n",

He advised the king to tell the queen he would fuck her only if she was blindfolded, then ask a trusted servant to service her instead until she became pregnant. \n  The King was pleased with the advice, so much that he asked the manservant to sleep with her, to the man-servant's delight. Although the queen sensed something was not right, she accepted the king's request since she desperately wanted a child. The servant did her until she got pregnant, and nine months later a baby boy was born.\n   Many years passed and the child grew up. However, the people did not fail to notice the uncanny resemblance between the man-servant and the child. Tired of being accused of being an adulterous woman, she confronted the king and after when he could not bare her nagging, he told her the whole truth.\n    \"You idiot,\" said the shocked and furious queen, \"you should have asked your handsome stepbrother to do me, not that long-nosed midget!\"",

And since the closest sheep farmer was over 9 hour drive one way, he ran to his neighbor that happened to be a vet asking for help.\nThe vet looked at him and just said.\n\nJohn, you got two options. Option one : is to drive all your sheep\u00b4s to the closest sheep farmer . Or  option two : that you could do it yourself.\n\nFarmer John looked at the vet with big eyes. \"Myself?\".\n\nYes said the vet. Just take these blue pills, and if the sheep\u00b4s are laying down the morning after , the deed is done. \n\nFarmer John was not happy with both of the options, so he told the vet that he would think about it.\n\nWhen he got home his wife asked him :  John dear, did the vet give any advice what you could do?  \nAnd John replied that he needed to think about it. \nThat he did, actually for several weeks, until that day his sheep\u00b4s where ready for mating.\n\nDreading the idea of having to drive the sheep\u00b4s all that way. He decided to go for the second option and got the pills from the vet.\n\nBut now John had a problem, how to get around to do that \"deed\" with the sheep\u00b4s without having his wife catching him in the \"act\". After a short thought he got a brain storm. Corralled the sheep\u00b4s into his truck and drove off with them, yelling at his wife when passing by the house that he would not be long with the sheep\u00b4s. \n\nAfter a hour drive he found a secluded spot where he could , do the \"deed\" without being spotted by his wife and god forbid any neighbor. \n\nSo on he went, one by one he fucked each sheep for few minutes after taking the pill and when the deed was done, he got them back on the truck and hurried with them home.\n\nBut the morning after when he got up and hurried to the sheep\u00b4s , he sadly found them all standing.\n\nWHAT THE HELL: Screamed John, cursing under his breath that he could not perform on the sheep\u00b4s enough to make them pregnant. So he hurried again and as before he got them on his truck and drove off with them. Cursing the whole time that he would so show them. \n\nBut this time he took his time with each of the sheep. Fucking them for almost thirty minutes each, and when he was done, he was a little shaken but was pretty sure that he had done the deed now as he drove the sheep\u00b4s home.\n\nMorning after , he almost wanted to cry when he saw each of the sheep\u00b4s standing there and looking at him. \n\nFurious he got them back into his truck, speeding with them back to the place and as soon as he popped the pill he started fucking them. And after a hour with each sheep he was shaking, trembling. But by all that load left in each sheep there could be no way that non of the sheep was not impregnated now by him. \n\nAnd the ride home was slow, after eight hours of that marathon of sex with his sheep\u00b4s, he was more than happy when he finally got home and straight into bed as he knew the sheep\u00b4s would be laying in the morning after this.\n\nAnd he barely felt like he had slept when his wife woke him up.\n\nJohn... John... JOHN!!!\n\nWhat , what ? mumbled John barely grasping in his mind what was going on. But his wife was visibly shaken.\n\nSomething is wrong with the sheep\u00b4s John.. She stated with her eyes wide and doe like. \n\nAhhh! said John. Are the sheep\u00b4s all laying down?\n\nNo! Screamed his wife. They are all in the truck, honking the horn.",

After a minute or so, the object was almost to the rear of his car, and he could tell that it was not large at all. He glanced at his side view mirror, and saw that the object was getting ready to pass him, so he slowed down to 40 MPH. As the object began to pass, the man was shocked to see that it was a chicken, leaving a cloud of dust in its wake.\n\nThe man sped up to 50 MPH, and the chicken was keeping pace. Accelerating to 60 MPH, the chicken began to pull away, and whipped in front of the man, leaving him in a cloud of dust. The road began to twist and turn more, so he slowed down, and followed the dusty trail left behind by the speeding bird.\n\nThe man followed the chicken for another minute or so, and saw it run under a fence next to a farmhouse, where there was a huge dust cloud being kicked up. He pulled off of the road, and parked next to the fence, at about the same spot that the chicken ran underneath.\n\nAs he was trying to figure out what had just happened, he glanced down at the ground, and noticed another chicken pecking around at a fence post. Upon closer examination, he was shocked to see that the chicken had three legs, and there were many more running around inside the fence. He didn't know what to think about this situation.\n\nJust then, an older gentleman comes up to the man and says, \"Can I help ya?\"\n\nThe man says, \"Uhh, sure, I think so. I think that I was passed on the road by one of your chickens. I followed it here, and it ran underneath the fence, and now I see this one here with THREE legs!

Intending to visit one of the local churches, he got lost, but eventually got back on track and found the place.\u00a0\n\nHaving arrived late, the church was already packed. The only pew left was the one on the front row.\u00a0\n\nSo as not to make a fool of himself, he decided to pick someone out of the crowd to imitate. He chose to follow the man sitting next to him on the front pew. As they sang, the man clapped his hands, so the missionary recruit clapped too.\u00a0\n\nWhen the man stood up to pray, the missionary recruit stood up too. When the man sat down, he sat down. When the man held the cup and bread for the Lord's Supper, he held the cup and bread.\u00a0\n\nDuring the preaching, the recruit didn't understand a thing. He just sat there and tried to look just like that man in the front pew.\u00a0\n\nThen the preacher said some words that he didn't understand and he saw the man next to him stand up. So he stood up too. Suddenly a hush fell over the entire congregation. A few people gasped. He looked around and saw that nobody else was standing. So he sat down.\u00a0\n\nAfter the service ended, the preacher stood at the door shaking the hands of those who were leaving. When the missionary recruit stretched out his hand to greet the preacher, the preacher said, in English: \"I take it you don't speak Spanish.\"\u00a0\n\nThe missionary recruit replied: \"No I don't. It's that obvious?\"\u00a0\n\n\"Well yes,\" said the preacher, \"I announced that the Acosta family had a newborn baby boy and would the proud father please stand up.\"",

During his exploring he manages to find an odd looking building. *This looks interesting,* he thinks, so he enters. There he is suddenly approached by an old man, who asks what he's doing here?\n\n\"Oh?\" says the man. \"I just want to know what this poky little place is for.\"\n\n\"Actually,\" says the old man, \"you've come at a good time. This is a commune holding a small religious community and we're looking to grow our numbers.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I'm not interested.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps you can stay until night and see what it's like,\" the old man suggests.\"\n\nNow the tourists is suspicious that this old man might have criminal purposes, and considers leaving. But as soon as the thought enters his mind, he remembers his commitment to truly experience Southeast Asian culture, off the beaten path, more immersed than other tourists. *I'm not afraid of a little risk,* the tourist thinks to himself. \n\n\"I think I will stay for a while,\" the tourist says, to the old man's happiness. The old man, after saying some words of thanks, leads the tourist to a table.\n\n\"Let me tell you about our little commune,\" says the old man. \"You see, we that originally had our roots in America. We're taking it upon ourselves to bring Jesus' millennial kingdom ourselves. Other Christians are all deluded. You see, Jesus really returned during...\" \n\nAnd the old man continues on like this, and the tourist begins to grow bored. Sensing this, the old man suddenly changes topic. \n\n\"Young man,\" he says, \"let me tell you something special about our religious commune. We don't believe in marriage. We're freer than that. We let men and women sleep with whomever they please.\"\n\n\"Some sort of prostitution thing?\"\n\n\"Oh heavens no, we don't believe in money. Everything is a free choice.\"\n\n\"Oh really?\" asks the tourist, who is starting to think that his risk-taking will pay dividends. \"Can I see some of the others, then?\"\n\n\"Of course!\" says the old man, and he calls out some names. In a short while three beautiful women appear at the end of the room. \n\n\"Oh my,\" says the tourist.\n\n\"Indeed,\" says the old man, \"we don't believe in marriage. Ladies, please escort this young man to the guest room.\"\n\nAnd the women, giggling, surround the tourist and take him upstairs toward a large room with a bed in the middle. Hardly believing his luck, the tourist quickly strips down. But then the women start to laugh.\n\n\"Oh, wait, you don't understand!\" cries the tourist. \"It's just cold in here!\" But the women are laughing harder now.\n\n\"Whatever!\" cries the tourist, \"you probably all have nasty STDs anyway!\" He quickly pulls his pants back up over his incredibly embarrassing erection. Tears appear in his eyes. The women are in hysterics. Humiliated, the tourist runs out of the room, downstairs, past the old man, and out the door, harshly regretting his decision to go off the beaten path.\n\n\"Well,\" chuckles the old man to himself. \"Looks like Oneida Bangkok makes a hard man humble.\"\n\n",

None of the apartments in this complex have air-conditioning. It's close to midnight, December in Sydney AUS, it's a hot humid night. \n\n**Story:** With the heat and humidity I was finding it very hard to sleep, and had taken to watching some Japanese horror flicks on my laptop to kill some time. I had my headphones on since I needed to open all the bedroom windows (thanks to the heat) and I didn't want to disturb my neighbours.\nAt a poignant part of the story in the movie, I could hear over the sound track a slow rhythmic masculine groan. After about a minute of confusion I realised that some of my neighbours were enjoying some casual coital union. The rhythmic groan picked up in frequency and amplitude, and was soon offset with his partners feminine \"yes\"es.\nNeedless to say, I was no longer watching my horror movie and I was laughing hysterically, yet quietly, at this point into my pillow.\n\nQuickly their coital activities got to a point of \"fever pitch\" where the male neighbour announced, \"I'm gonna cum, I'm gonna cum!\" to which the female neighbour demands he \"wait, and cum on my face!\". Cue a series of climatic groaning and other such sounds of affirmation.\n\nJob done, the female announces that she's heading off to have a shower (good call) and goes to the bathroom to do so. All the windows are open it seems, as one can hear all the associated sounds of a shower hard earned. \n\nUpon her arrival back into the bedroom the female scolds her counterpart for lighting up and enjoying a cigarette in her absence,  stating \"Dammit you know that ciggie smoke irritates my sinuses!\". Shortly after this statement, she sneezes loudly and impressively. At this point I turn towards my open window and say in a nice loud voice \"Bless you!\"...\n\n..Silence...\n\n...An embarrassed scream.\n\n...And a Guinness World Record attempt in the number of windows closed in the shortest period of time possible. \n\nI nearly pissed myself laughing.",

Well, he decides to mail the gloves to his girl and adds the following note:\n\n\"I got you these because I noticed you don't normally wear any. I think I'd have preferred ones with buttons, but your sister wears short ones too, and they're easier to pull off. The color might be a bit risky, but the shop assistant showed me hers, which she'd been wearing for three weeks, and they were hardly stained. She also tried yours on, and it look really chic. \n\nI wish I could be the first one to put them on you, but by the time I see you next Friday, I'm sure many will have come into contact with them. When you take them off, don't forget to blow into them, because they get wet from wearing. Think about how often I'll kiss them for the next years. I hope you'll wear them for me this Friday.\n\nLove,\nyour darling.\n\nPS: The newest fashion is to wear them turned-down so that a bit of the fur shows.",

So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave.\nTherefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell.\n\nWith birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.\n\nNow, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added. This gives two possibilities:\n\n1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.\n\n2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.\n\nSo which is it?\n\nIf we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that, \"It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,\" and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not  accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct......leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, Teresa kept shouting \"Oh my God.\"",

One day, whilst working in the factory, the cheerio - lets call him Bob - noticed a flaw in the production line that decreased production speeds by 10000%. He reported this to his manager, and guess what? The improvement made both Bob and his manager super-rich, enough to move to Frosted Cheerio island.\n\nNow, after this major upgrade, Bob had everything he wanted. Girls, cash, a tower of a home. But this was not enough for bob. He looked over the ocean, just to see the shining lights of Honey Nut Island, drawing him in like a fly to a light.  It became his new goal to one day set foot on this island.\nBob worked hard, and partied harder. Once, during a party, he met a representative of the Honey Nut Island, who had been vetting him silently for the last few months. The representative approached Bob, and told him he managed to meet the requirements to become a citizen of Honey Nut Island. Bob asked when he would move over, and the rep replied, 'Immediately'.\n\nHoney Nut Island was the stuff of dreams and legends, and Bob's imagination of what the island was like did not disappoint him. Even the endless drink lines that he had dreamed about existed. Bob was really in the mood for Fruit Punch, and he began looking for it. But, sadly, there was no Punch line.",

So what\u2019s your story?\u201d\n\nThe first man replies: \u201cWell, for a while I\u2019ve suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn\u2019t reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn\u2019t you know it, he wouldn\u2019t fall off.\n\nSo I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and started hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn\u2019t stand that for long, so he let go and fell\u2014but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds like a pretty bad day to me,\u201d said Patrick, and he let the man in.\n\nThe second man comes up and Patrick explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn\u2019t hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved! But then he started beating on me and kicking me. I managed to hold on until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but okay. Just when I was thinking I was going to be all right, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me, killing me instantly. And, now I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nOnce again, Patrick had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death.\n\nThe third man came to the front of the line, and again the whole process was repeated. Patrick explained that heaven was full and asked for his story.\n\n\u201cOK, picture this,\u201d says the third man, \u201cI\u2019m hiding naked inside a refrigerator....\u201d",

At this point, the drumming has gone on non-stop for 12 hours and is loud enough that they need to raise their voices to communicate.\n\nThe businessman, getting annoyed, says to his guide, \"This is getting ridiculous! Do they ever stop that blasted drumming?!\"\n\nThe tour guide, looks at the businessman with a serious expression and again says, \"Drums good.

They pack up their things in the morning and head off, again deeper into the jungle - the noise from the drumming getting louder and louder with every step.\n\nFinally, the businessman can take it no more. He reaches forward and grabs his guide by the shoulder and spins him around. Screaming to be heard over the drums, he asks, \"What is with these god damn drums? Don't tell me 'Drums good.

Saturday morning, Little Bobby packed up his bass and went off to his first lesson.\n\nUpon returning home, Papa Tavoli stopped him and asked, \"What did you learn at your lesson this week?\"\n\nLittle Bobby removed his bass from his gig-bag and said, \"I learned the E string.\" He plucked the lowest string a few times and said \"E.

Again, as he walked in the door, his father stopped him and asked Little Bobby to show him what he had learned.\n\nLittle Bobby once again removed his bass from the gig-bag and said, \"This week we learned quarter notes.\" He plucked the E string four times, keeping fairly good time and saying \"1. 2. 3. 4.\"\n\nExcited about his son's progress, Papa Tavoli patted Little Bobby on the back and sent him to continue his studies.\n\nOn the third Saturday, Little Bobby was up early practicing his E string and quarter notes and then left for his lesson without so much as a goodbye.

Murphy, being a Cork man, was very agreeable, a sound man altogether. Garda Ryan was stern, by the book and extremely literal when it came to the details. Garda O'Sullivan was a Kerry man, and represented all that is wrong with police officers; idiotic and with a disturbing lack of foresight.\n\nSo the day of the final test arrives, and the three participants are lined up outside a room and handed a gun each. They are told that they must enter the room and shoot whoever is sitting in the chair in order to pass the final test.\n\nGarda Murphy from Cork is first to go in, and shutting the door behind him, he sees his very own wife sitting in the chair. Without any thought, he unties her and walks out a separate door, failing the test. \"Unfortunately Garda Murphy, you have failed the test. The gun is loaded with blanks. We would never have made you kill Mrs. Murphy.\" Garda Murphy walks out.\n\nGarda Ryan from Dublin is next. He takes the gun and enters the room. After some quick deliberation, he sighs, cocks the handgun and fires at his wife. Understandably, he leaves the room with his wife quite upset, but satisfied in the knowledge that he has passed the test. \"Congratulations, Garda Ryan. You're surely in the running for 001.\"\n\nFinally, the intellectually challenged Garda O'Sullivan from Kerry enters. He takes the gun and enters the room. Lo, Mrs. O'Sullivan is sat in the centre of the room.\n\nTwenty minutes later, Garda O'Sullivan exits the room with his bloodied and deceased wife.\n\n\"Lads, some stupid cunt filled the gun with blanks so I had to beat her to death with the fuckin' chair!\"",

He hits a few buttons and from somewhere on the watch a voice says, \"The time is eleven 'til six\" in a very West Texas accent. A few more buttons and the same voice says something in Japanese. \n\nJake continues, \"I've put in regional accents for each city.\" The display is unbelievably high quality and the voice is simply astounding. The stranger is struck dumb with admiration. \n\n\"That's not all\", says Jake. He pushes a few more buttons and a tiny but very high-resolution map of New York City appears on the display. \"The flashing dot shows our location by satellite positioning,\" explains Jake.  \"View recede ten,\" Jake says, and the display changes to show eastern New York state.\n\n\"I want to buy this watch!\" says the stranger.\n\n\"Oh, no, it's not ready for sale yet; I'm still working out the bugs,\" says the inventor. \"But look at this,\" and he proceeds to demonstrate that the watch is also a very creditable little FM radio receiver with a digital tuner, a sonar device that can measure distances up to 125 meters, a pager with thermal paper printout and, most impressive of all, the capacity for voice recordings of up to 300 standard-size books, \"though I only have 32 of my favorites in there so far,\" says Jake.\n\n\"I've got to have this watch!\" says the stranger.\n\n\"No, you don't understand; it's not ready -\"\n\n\"I'll give you $1000 for it!\"\n\n\"Oh, no, I've already spent more than -\"\n\n\"I'll give you $5000 for it!\"\n\n\"But it's just not -\"\n\n\"I'll give you $15,000 for it!\" And the stranger pulls out a checkbook.  Jake stops to think. He's only put about $8,500 into materials and development, and with $15,000 he can make another one and have it ready for merchandising in only six months. \n\nThe stranger frantically finishes writing the check and waves it in front of him. \"Here it is, ready to hand to you right here and now. $15,000.  Take it or leave it.\"\n\nJake abruptly makes his decision. \"OK\", he says, and peels off the watch.  They make the exchange and the stranger starts happily away. \n\n\"Hey, wait a minute,\" calls Jake to the stranger, who turns around warily.

It was preparing to descend onto the surface of the river when a fish happened to notice it.  The fish thinks to itself, \"when this fly drops 3 inches to the surface of the water, I'm going to jump out and eat the fly.\" Now, unbeknownst to the fish was a bear sitting under the trees on the riverbank.  The bear also notices and fly as well as the fish and thinks to himself, \"when this fly drops 3 inches, the fish is going to come to the surface of the water and I'm going to grab it.\" The next character in our story is a hunter who is sitting a bit further back in the woods from the water. The hunter too sees all this unfolds and says to himself, \"when the fly drops, the fish will surface, and the bear will step out in the open to get the fish. that's when ill make my move and shoot the bear.\" Now the hunter, he happens to be eating a cheese sandwich. We'll say its cheddar cheese.  In a nearby bush is a mouse who also sees all of this unfolding. The mouse concludes that when the hunter attempts to shoot the bear, he must drop his cheese sandwich to do so.  Thus the mouse thinks,\"when the hunter drops the cheese sandwich, I'll scurry out and grab it!\" And finally the last participant in our story is a cat who is crouching gracefully high in a tree above all of this. The cat thinks,\"when the fly drops 3 inches, the fish will come to the surface, the bear will step out to the get the fish, the hunter will shoot the bear, the mouse will run to grab the cheese sandwich, and I will pounce on the mouse!\"  All of this happens in an instance - The fly drops 3 inches, the fish eats the fly, the bear grabs the fish, the hunter drops the cheese sandwich and shoots the bear, the mouse grabs the cheese sandwich, BUT the cat pounces completely missing the mouse and lands SPLASH in the river. What is the moral of this story?\n\n[When the fly drops 3 inches, the pussy gets wet.](/spoiler)",

All my program information was waiting for me in my room, and the next morning I had my program orientation and started my program.\n\nThe weight loss retreat is REALLY amazing with fresh organic (and simply delicious!) raw food in the beginning while detoxifying, and then a variety of lean proteins (like fish and chicken) with many tasty sides and a nice big smoothie or fresh coconut to wash it down. The fitness classes are awesome fun, they have everything from boot camp and CrossFit style training, to Pilates and Yoga, TRX suspension training, Muay Thai boxing, weight training, 1-on-1 sessions, and so much more! It\u2019s all put together into a program which destroys fat, builds lean muscle while detoxifying your body and making you look and feel great!\n\nSo far it\u2019s going great and my weight is down almost 5kg, hoping to lose 14kg in the rest of my time on the retreat.",

One day a clown came to his class. The clown juggled pins and did standard clown things. Ever since that day Ralf was obsessed with the circus. All he wanted to do was go to the circus then on his birthday his dad bought him two tickets to the circus. He was so happy and couldn't wait to go. The circus finally came and he was so happy. Him and his dad went into the main tent and went to find the seats. They finally got to the top of the seating. They were the worst seats in the house, but Ralf loved it. The clowns juggled and there were lions and horses and the clown car. Ralf loved all of it. Then at the end the ringmaster came out and asked for a volunteer. Ralf raised his hand high and enthusiastically and the clown called on him. He was so happy as we he went down to the stage. The clown called for his horse. He pointed to the horse's head and said \"this is the horse's head\" he pointed to the horse's body and said \"this is the horse's body\" he pointed at Ralf and said \"and this, is the horse's ass\" Ralf was so embarrassed as the entire crowd laughed at him. After that he devoted his entire life to getting back at that clown. He practised comebacks all through highschool and applied to Harvard's secret school of comebackery. He got in and studied comeback theory. He bought a ticket to the very same circus. They did ask the same things as before, but this time he wasn't amused. At the end the the ringmaster came out again. He needed a volunteer. Ralf raised his hand and got picked. He coolly walked down to the stage. The clown called out his horse. He pointed to the horse's head and said \"this us the horse's head\" he pointed to the horse's body and said \"this us the horse's body\" then he pointed at Ralf and said \"and this is the horse's ass\" the whole crowd laughed at him again Ralf stole the microphone from the clown and mustered all the comebackery might that he could and yelled info the mic \"FUCK YOU CLOWN\"",

It took me a moment, but I realised he was there, and looked up at him.\n\n\"Come on\", he said, \"you've got to give up. It's not good for you. You're....\". He trailed off after that, but that 'twirly finger by the ear' thing everyone knows means 'fuck, mate, you're insane'.\n\n\"I can't\", I replied through my luxurious crossword-beard, \"I need to finish this one last thing, and then....and then I'll be fine.

Since he has no one waiting for him in his apartment, he decides to go to his favorite pub to celebrate.\n\nSo he arrives, and pay for everyone's drink because of his mood. Everyone is happy and he is soon the man of the night. He then drinks a bit more, learn to know everyone, but he sees two girls on the other side of the bar which are ignoring him and not really cheering. \n\nHe goes to them, and to start the discussion, buy them drink. At first, they are a bit cold, but as he learns to know them, they appear way more happy and cheerful. As he finds out, they are both really beautiful and nice, but are also siamese sister, binded by the arm.\n\nSince everyone drank much, he feels confident enough to ask all the question about the issues siamese people might encounter, and then, inhibited, try to hit on one of them.\n\nSurprisingly, the girl is really responsive, as she later explain, a lot of people start to be uneased when they find out their condition, so she is pleased by the attention. He then ask about the other sister : \" Is it ok ? Will she not feel uncomfortable ?\" The  courted sister answers that they are used to it, and because of their condition they learned to make concession to the other they have to live with.\n\nAfter a while, and bolstered by the answers of the girls, Max ask the girls if they would like to go home with him for a last drink. The girls ask for a moment, go to the bathroom, probably to discuss a bit, then come back a accept the proposal.\n\nAs they drink in his appartment, things heat up between Max and the sister he fancies. He asks a last time the other sister if it is ok with her, and then they start to take off their clothes and to have sex together. \n\nThey do it once, twice, but as they start the third time, the second sister tap on Max's shoulder; asking, while taking the instrument out of her purse : \"do you mind if I play the bugle while you're at it ?\"\nMax is somehow shocked, but answer that, no he doesn't mind, he understands that she feel a little bit bored.\nThe night of love continues, as Max is galvanized by the sound of the bugle and discovers new skills he was not aware of. When the morning comes, he is exhausted but had the best night of his life.\n\nOn the morning, he is told that his date really enjoyed the night, but, because of her condition, she could not really start a relationship together but she will try to keep in touch with him. Since Max had fun but don't know if he can really manage this situation on a daily basis, he is quite relieved to hear this.\n\nThen, three months later, the sisters are walking in front of the bar. One say to the other : \"You remember this bar ? We met a really cool guy there, he was really nice and we end up in his appartment.\"\nThe other answers : \"Yeah, it was a really nice night !

So they're getting naked, and Guy 2 radios guy 1: slowly undress her. Guy 1 does what Guy 2 says. Then Guy 2 says: \"good now kiss her neck\". Again, Guy 1 does it. But suddenly, Guy 1 has this urge to take a sh*t. He politely excuses himself and runs into the bathroom to take a sh*t. While he's in there, the girl then has to take a sh*t too! But the guy isn't done and probably won't be for a while. So she looks around and finds an empty shoe box, and proceeds to take a sh*t in there. She hides it kind of under the bed, but not completely, as Guy 1 is coming out of the bathroom just as she finished. Guy 2 radios back into Guy 1: \"ok now look at her, walk towards her and climb on top of her. Then you just put your dick in her vagina and move it in and out and that's it, simple.\" Guy 1 proceeds to perform said actions, but when he gets to the end of the bed, he stepped into the shoe box the girl used. He screamed out, \"IT'S A SHIT BOX!!\"... And Guy 2 radios back: \"Wrong hole!!!\"",

She entered that area and observed her husband sitting on the couch, downing a cold beer, and staring at the TV.\nThe vibrator was next to him on the couch, buzzing like crazy. The wife asked: 'What the #@!* are you doing?'\nThe husband replied: 'I'm watching football with my son-in-law.'",

I don't even know where to start. First of all, my boss is a vicious tyrant who gets off on the petty torments he puts me through day in and day out, and I'm too spineless to stand up to him, so I just take it and I've gradually come to hate myself for it. Also, every morning I wake up to the same prune-face old crone to whom I pledged my vows so many years ago. I used to love her, but that love has become like some sun-festering beached whale trying to die. We lost our daughter last year to one of the bitterest, coldest winters we've ever had to face in this region. Isn't it funny, doc, how all the prayer circles and charity drives in the world amount to pretty much nothing in the face of that cold, impartial face of winter, that bleak, pounding, harsh fist of a callous environment, carrying on with its machinations without regard to our lives, loves, hopes and dreams? Isn't that hysterical, Doc? Oh and then there's my son. Doc, I don't love him anymore. I don't know what it is but I look in his eyes and I see that same harried look of gutless cowardice that I see when I stare at my own face in the mirror. If I wasn't such a coward, Doc, I know I'd be able to scrape together enough pride to grab that cocked and loaded shotgun I keep by the bedside table, and just run amok and put an end to this grim facade once and for all. I start with the wife, then the boy of course before putting the barrell in my own mouth. Believe you me, Doc, I'd be doing the world a favor. I have nothing to look forward to but a continuation of this spiraling black hole that is my life, this existential cesspool that is the perpetuation of my lingering skid-mark on society. I despise people yet I crave their approval. I'm judgemental yet I care about nothing. I'm bitter, hateful and afraid. I'm alive yet I feel like the walking dead. This is it, Doc: I am a living, breathing, disease.\"\n\nThe doctor stares at him for a while then finally says \"Jeez, Moth, you definitely have some problems. But I'm a podiatrist. You need a psychiatrist. Why'd you come in here?\"\n\nThe moth says,\"Your light was on.\"\n",

When they wake up, to their horror, they discover they have been taken prisoner by a native tribe and sentenced to death for trespassing on their territory. The chieftain feeling merciful, offers to grant each of the mens' last requests provided it was within their power.\n\nAfter a long time spent thinking, the first man wishes to taste the finest wine on the island. As the natives prepare their best drink, the chief approaches the first man and lightly pulls his skin exclaiming \"Ah, your skin will make for a great canoe!\". The wine is soon completed. After finishing his drink, the natives quickly cut him open and use his skin to waterproof a canoe.\n\nThe Chief then approaches the second man and asks him for his last request. After yet another long time spent thinking, he comes to terms with his fate and wishes for a swift death. Before commencing with his wish, the Chief inspects the prisoner and also exclaims: \"Ah! You too will make for a fine canoe!\". The second man is quickly killed and cut open for yet another canoe.\n\nThe third man after witnessing the murders of his 2 companions spends much longer than the first 2 in considering his final wish. The Chief returns at the end of the day saying his time is up and he must decide or they would kill him immediately. \n\nAfter a moment more of consideration he states \"I want a fork.\"\n\nThe chief was baffled but ordered his men to grant the man his wish anyways. The natives soon returned with the man's requested fork and then left to sharpen their knives. As the Chief returns to the man's cell he finds his guards attempting to restrain the prisoner who is now repeatedly stabbing himself with the fork and screaming:\n\n\"Nobody's making a canoe out of me!\". \n\nSorry if I'm not so good at formatting.

        "body": "An average Cheerio box has three levels. At the top is the realm of the complete, perfect Cheerios. These Cheerios live a life of luxury, with as much food and drink as they want, and little work to do. The second level of the box, the middle layer, is occupied by the imperfect but still mostly whole. These Cheerios have to work to survive, but life is manageable. The lowest level is occupied by the broken, destroyed fragments of Cheerios, that small children refuse to eat, and it is these Cheerios that must fight to survive in the dog-eat-dog world of the lower box.\n\nThe protagonist of our story is a Cheerio crumb from the lower box. For the sake of the story, this Cheerio's name is Jake. Jake had been born in the lower box, but had heard stories of the immense wealth of the Cheerios in the top layer. Being a naive young lad, Jake did not understand why he couldn't live up with the whole Cheerios. He dreamed of eating hamburgers and drinking lemonade, of laying around in the sun, He was determined to make it to the top. So one day, he began to climb.\n\nJake didn't tell his mother where he was going. He began to climb, Up and up he went, climbing to the top. He was determined to reach the top, and so he still climbed long into the night, and through til the next morning. Eventually, he reached the second layer of the box.\n\n\"Who the f**k are you?\" asked a big Cheerio in the shape of a 'C'\n\n\"I'm Jake. and I want to reach the top of the box.' our hero replied earnestly.\n\n\"Well, sorry mate, you're not going to\" apologised the big Cheerio as he picked up Jake by the collar and threw him back down into the lower section.\n\nJake fell far, and fell hard. He woke up on the very bottom of the box, and realised that he still wanted to get to the  top.  He began to climb, Up and up he went, climbing to the top. He was determined to reach the top, and so he still climbed long into the night, and through til the next morning. Eventually, he reached the second layer of the box.\n\n\"You again?\" asked the big Cheerio.\n\n\"I really. really want to get to the top\" Jake retorted breathlessly.\n\n\"Well, if  you really want to get there, how about you stay with me to get your strength back?\"  the bigger Cheerio offered.\n\n\"I'll take you up on that,\" Jake said graciously\n\nThe bug Cheerio's name was Kevin, and he was a nice guy. He didn't mind the lower downs, and he didn't begrudge the top dwellers their existence. In the morning Jake bid Kevin farewell and began to climb, Up and up he went, climbing to the top. He was determined to reach the top, and so he still climbed long into the night, and through til the next morning. Eventually, he reached the top layer of the box.\n\n\"What on earth is a Plebeian like you doing here?\" asked a gloriously perfect Cheerio.\n\n\"I'm Jake. and I want to reach the top of the box.' our hero replied earnestly.\n\n\"Well, tough luck, you're not going to\" said the complete Cheerio as he picked up Jake by the collar and threw him back down into the abyss below.\n\nJake fell very far, and fell  very hard. He woke up on the very bottom of the box, and realised that he still wanted to get to the  top.  He began to climb, Up and up he went, climbing to the top. He was determined to reach the top, and so he still climbed long into the night, and through til the next morning. Eventually, he reached the second layer of the box.\n\n\"You have a lot of determination for a young one,\" Kevin observed \"Come on, you can stay with me until you don't look like you've been hit by a train\"\n\nKevin's wife's name was Kay, and she was a bitch. She hated the lower downs, and worshipped the top dwellers. In the morning Jake bid Kevin farewell (after sh*ting in Kay's car)  and began to climb, Up and up he went, climbing to the top. He was determined to reach the top, and so he still climbed long into the night, and through til the next morning. Eventually, he reached the top layer of the box.\n\n\"How on earth did you survive that fall?\" asked the pompous Cheerio.\n\n\"It's only about 20 centimetres\" Jake told him.\n\n\"True- but to climb all the way back here after... you must be made of special stuff.\" The complete Cheerio turned around and picked up a card. \"This is a visitors card. It allows you to stay up here for a day, and you are allowed to have one drink and one item of food. However, you must leave and never return once this day has finished\".\n\nJake accepted, and set out to explore the top layer. It was everything he'd dreamed and more. They had streets of gold and fields of green. Kittens and puppies played everywhere. Jake happily explored the area until lunchtime, when he decided he wanted to get his food and drink. He approached the hamburger restraunt, but saw that the line went out the door. He decided to get a drink first.\n\nJake walked over to the lemonade stand, but was shocked to discover that the line was several hundred metres long. He realised he did not have enough time to wait in this line, so he decided to find a different drink. He walked up to one of the Cheerios in the lemonade line.\n\n\"Excuse me sir,\" Jake said nervously.\n\n:\"What is it, plebeian?\" the higher class Cheerio  asked haughtily.\n\n\"I was wondering where the punch line was,\" Jake suggested.\n\nThe posh Cheerio thought for a second, \"I'm sorry, son, but there is no punchline\"",

He grabs the money and runs away to go try it out on his dad. \n\nHe finds his dad upstairs and tries it again. He locks eyes and says, \"I Know.\" The dad has the exact same reaction as the mom. He pulls out his wallet, hands him $20 and says, \"Don't tell you're mother. You'll get it when you're older.\"\n\nAt this point, the kid is ecstatic. He can't believe it actually works, and he has the money for his game. He's so excited that he decides to try it on the next adult he sees to get even more money.\n\nSure enough, the doorbell rings soon after, so the boy runs down the stairs and finds the mailman there.

There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.\n\nHe stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out\nand he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.\n\nHe thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon\nhow dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So,\nhe puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication\nlater, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give\nhim a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle\nin case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the\ndirection he thinks is right.\n\nHe walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's\nbeen sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and\nwhether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.\n\nHe pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.\n\nBy the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the\ntown. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.\n\nAs it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things,\nhe finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.\n\nFull dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back\nup and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.\n\nHe wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.\n\nHe knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.\n\nHe rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in\nhis mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't\nfind water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.\n\nThen he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.\n\nLooking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.\n\nAs he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.\n\nHe decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait\nany longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large\nrock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly\nswallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry\nand cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes\nanother mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle.\nHe figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to\nmake some difference and keep himself from passing out.\n\nHe's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him,\nit kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty\nsure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.\n\nHe walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills,\ndunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water.\nSometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.\n\nAfter a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat\nstroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.\n\nAfter more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He\nknows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing\ndonuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy\nenough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if\nhe's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it,\ntrying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.\n\nHe was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.\n\nHe walks through the sand.\n\nAfter a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't\nremember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he\ndoesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.\n\nBut, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures\nthat he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from\nthere that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.\n\nHalfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third\ntime, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll\njust fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.\n\nWhile crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally\ngotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through\nthe sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert\nin the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any\nrips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape -\nshake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.\n\nHe finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top,\nhe struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees\nis sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he\nsees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more\ndunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.\n\nAgain, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper\nfluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the\ncap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from\nhere. He's going to have to go down there and look.\n\nHe puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune.\nAfter a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.\n\nHe stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough\nenergy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When\nhe clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot\nin the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.\n\nSo, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins\nto crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to\nhave the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages\nof dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't\nhave water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last\nchance.\n\nHe gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the\ndark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting\nhis head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just\nkeeps crawling.\n\nFinally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center,\nwhere his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone\narea.\n\nHis mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark\nstone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun\noverhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying\ndown on the nice cool surface.\n\nCool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's\nprobably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and\ndying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the\nbeautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him\na drink. Then he'll know he's gone.\n\nHe decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here\nin the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the\ncenter before he goes. He keeps crawling.\n\nIt's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's\nhearing. He would swear that someone just said, \"Greetings, traveler. You do\nnot look well. Do you hear me?\"\n\nHe stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and\nknees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something\ndifferent - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few\nseconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and\ntries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands\nand tries again. Better this time.\n\nYep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse\nof stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or\npole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet\nout of the stone, at an angle.\n\nAnd wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and\nseeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long\ndesert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.\n\nHe stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and\nrun away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his\nfinal resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to\nmove from this spot.\n\nWell, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than\ndying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a\nlittle straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves\nit in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a\nmoment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.\n\nHmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet -\nthat was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.\n\nHe then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here\nbecause he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was\nlikely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was\nnow on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had\nactually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white\npost sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe\nthey were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake\nwas even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.\n\nHe tries to clear his throat to say, \"Hello,\" but his throat is too dry. All\nthat comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going\nto be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the\nbottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out,\nalmost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't\ngood. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes\nout.\n\nHe gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips,\nand pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then\nswallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk\nnow.\n\nHe tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to\nspot the owner of this place, and croaks out, \"Hello? Is there anyone here?\"\n\nHe hears, from his side, \"Greetings. What is it that you want?\"\n\nHe turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed\nto come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a\nspeaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides\nto try asking for help.\n\n\"Please,\" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, \"I'd love to not be\nthirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?\"\n\nLooking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was\ncoming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its\nmouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he\nfalls forward, face first on the stone, \"Very well. Coming up.\"\n\nA piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits\nup and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily\ndisoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the\nsand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped\naround the tilted white post, still looking at him.\n\nHe reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet.\nHe pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder\nagain - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes -\nthey match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been\nbitten. By the snake.\n\n\"It'll feel better in a minute.\" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He\nhadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more\nimportantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!\n\n\"Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the\nafterlife?\"\n\n\"Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,\" says the snake. \"That's the way I\nwork. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.\"\n\n\"You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a\ndrink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be\nthirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for\nthe windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk?\nAre you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?\"\n\n\"No,\" says the snake, \"I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I\ndidn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I\nbite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just\nsitting around here.\"\n\nThe man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the\ndesert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a\nsnake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not\ngreat - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no\nlonger thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt\nhot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool\nstone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer\ndying of thirst.\n\n\"I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your\nsystem with the next request,\" continued the snake. \"I can guess why you\ndrank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left\nin the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or\ntwo, if you drank enough of it.\"\n\n\"Ummm, n-next request?\" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting\nshoulder and backed away from the snake a little.\n\n\"That's the way it works. If you like, that is,\" explained the snake. \"You\nget three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish.\" The snake grinned at his\nown joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.\n\n\"But there are rules,\" the snake continued. \"The first request is free. The\nsecond requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of\nresponsibility.\" The snake looks at the man seriously.\n\n\"By the way,\" the snake says suddenly, \"my name is Nathan. Old Nathan,\nSamuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound\nused to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand\nfor it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into\nnames. You can call me Nate, if you wish.\" Again, the snake grinned. \"Sorry\nif I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds\nsomewhat threatening.\" The snake give his rattle a little shake.\n\n\"Umm, my name is Jack,\" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. \"Jack\nSamson.\n\n\"Can I ask you a question?\" Jack says suddenly. \"What happened to the\npoison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that?\nWhat do you mean by that's how you work?\"\n\n\"That's more than one question,\" grins Nate. \"But I'll still try to answer\nall of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question.\" The snake's grin gets\nwider. \"Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need\nto drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not\nbe thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make\nit permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at\nall. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to\nget enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert.\nYou've been changed.\n\n\"For the third question,\" Nate continues, \"you are still dying. Besides the\neffects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal.\nIn your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years.\nAssuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is.\" Nate seemed vastly\namused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.\n\n\"As for the fourth question,\" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack\ncould tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read\ntalking-snake emotions from snake facial features, \"first you have to agree\nto make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell\nyou.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" joked Jack, \"isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd\nhave to kill me?\"\n\n\"I thought that was implied.\" Nate continued to look serious.\n\n\"Ummm...yeah.\" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was\ntalking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a\nnasty temper. \"So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really\nstop the effects of the methanol?\" Jack thought for a second. \"And, what do\nyou mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper\nfluid, and just denature it?\"\n\n\"They may, I don't really know,\" said Nate. \"I haven't gotten out in a\nwhile. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and\non that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you\npulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume\nthat they still color wiper fluid blue?\"\n\n\"Yeah, they do,\" said Jack.\n\n\"I figured,\" replied Nate. \"As for being bound by secrecy - with the\nfulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me,\nthis place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you\ndecide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me,\nwrite about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will\nlead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of\ncourse, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm\nguessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding\nanyway, so you won't notice.\" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.\n\nJack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a\nlittle nervous at this. \"Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know\nthat? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?\"\n\nWell, Jack,\" said Nate sadly, \"I can't tell you that, unless you make the\nsecond request.\" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.\n\n\"Umm, well, ok,\" said Jack, \"what is this about a second request? What can I\nask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?\"\n\n\"Sure!\" said Nate, brightening. \"You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes\nto yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and\nbefore you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or\nomnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous\nand yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and\nsort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be\nomniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very\nuseful, at least in my opinion.\" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was\nstaring at him.\n\n\"Well, anyway,\" continued Nate, \"I'd probably suggest giving you permanent\ngood health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be\nimmune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long\ntime, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to\nrecover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a\nrequest to me.\"\n\n\"Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?\" said Jack. \"And keep me healthy for a\nlong time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request\nabout a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not\nreally a change to me?\"\n\n\"Right,\" nodded Nate.\n\n\"Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?\" Jack asked, hopefully.\n\n\"That takes two requests, Jack.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I figured so,\" said Jack. \"But I could ask to be a genius? I could\nbecome the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?\"\n\n\"Well, I could make you very smart,\" admitted Nate, \"but that wouldn't\nnecessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you\nvery athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either.\nYou've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some\ntruth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It\nall depends on what you decide to do with it.\"\n\n\"Hmmm,\" said Jack. \"Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request,\nafter this one?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Nate, \"it depends on what you decide then. There are more\nrules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second\nrequest. You know how it goes.\" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had\nshoulders.\n\n\"Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent\nhealth doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially.\nDo I need to sign in blood or something?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Nate. \"Just hold out your hand. Or heel.\" Nate grinned. \"Or\nwhatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said,\nthat's how it works - the poison, you know,\" Nate said apologetically.\n\nJack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it\ndidn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better\nabout the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot\nsnake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to\nbe able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack\ntried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it\nwouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.\n\n\"Hey, Jack,\" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind\nhim, \"is that someone else coming up over there?\"\n\nJack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of\nnowhere? And did they bring food?\n\nWait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...\n\nJack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through\nhis jeans...\n\nJack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. \"I would have\ndecided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to\nhoodwink me like that.\"\n\n\"I've been doing this a long time, Jack,\" said Nate, confidently. \"You\nhumans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you -\nespecially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of\nminutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the\nhealth benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, still,\" said Jack, \"it's the principle of the thing. And nobody\nlikes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or\nsomething instead?\"\n\n\"More meat in the typical human butt,\" replied Nate. \"And less chance you\naccidentally kick me or move at the last second.\"\n\n\"Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify\nto hear,\" answered Jack.\n\n\"Ok,\" said Nate. \"Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to\njust start talking?\"\n\n\"Just talk,\" said Jack. \"I'll sit here and try to not think about food.\"\n\n\"We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,\"\nanswered Nate.\n\n\"Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!\" Jack jumped up.\n\"What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically\nwhip up food along with your other powers?\" Jack was almost shouting with\nexcitement. His stomach had been growling for hours.\n\n\"I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite\nit for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife,\nthat is,\" replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to.\n\n\"Ugh,\" said Jack, sitting back down. \"I think I'll pass. I can last a little\nlonger before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it\nis you find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw.\nNo thanks. Just talk.\"\n\n\"Ok,\" replied Nate, still grinning. \"But I'd better hurry, before you start\nlooking at me as food.\n\nNate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued.\n\"You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden.\"\n\nJack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate\nsceptically.\n\n\"Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack,\" said Nate. \"Stand up\nand look at the symbol on the rock here.\" Nate gestured around the dark\nstone they were both sitting on with his nose.\n\nJack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a\nrepresentation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around\nwas coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches\nleft the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it\nlooked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and\nembedded in the stone than it did like a carving.\n\nJack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the\nsetting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the\nsky.\n\nWait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another\nnight out here! Arrrgh!\n\nJack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and\nstood next to Nate. \"In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate,\" said\nJack. \"Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to\nhave to head back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw\ndesert critters for long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to.\"\n\n\"It's about 30 miles that way.\" Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail\nthis time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to\nthe way he'd been going when he was crawling here. \"But that's 30 miles by\nthe way the crow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be\nable to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head\nout early tomorrow, Jack.\"\n\nJack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and\nthen sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading\nout right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting\nstuff. \"Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway,\" said Nate. \"He\nfigured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a\n'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he\ncould never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from\nacross the ocean. He worried about that for a while.\"\n\n\"Garden of Eden, hunh?\" said Jack. \"How long have you been here, Nate?\"\n\n\"No idea, really,\" replied Nate. \"A long time. It never occurred to me to\ncount years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I\ndo remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands\nof years, at least.\"\n\n\"So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?\" said Jack.\n\n\"Beats me,\" said Nate. \"Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your\nkind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it\ncould have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant\nrequests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals.\"\n\n\"Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out\nof the stone there?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much\nbigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember\nif it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But\none day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do\nsomething for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've\nbeen here ever since.\n\n\"What is this place?\" said Jack. \"And what did he ask you to do?\"\n\n\"Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?\" Nate loosened his\ncoils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into\nthe stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to\nenter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned\nover and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as\nJack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but\nNate was suddenly there in the way.\n\n\"You can't touch that yet, Jack,\" said Nate.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I haven't explained it to you yet,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something,\" said Jack. \"You'd push it\nthat way, and it would move in the slot.\"\n\n\"Yep, that's what it is,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"What does it do?\" asked Jack. \"End the world?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Nate. \"Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it\n'The Lever of Doom'.\" For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing\nvoice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and\ngrinned.\n\nJack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned\nJack laughed. \"Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it\nreally do?\"\n\n\"Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said,\" smirked Nate. \"I just thought\nthe voice I used was funny, didn't you?\"\n\nNate continued to grin.\n\n\"A lever to end humanity?\" asked Jack. \"What in the world is that for? Why\nwould anyone need to end humanity?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Nate, \"I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment.\nOr maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really\nbad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are\nthe rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I\ndidn't think to ask back when I started here.\"\n\n\"Rules? What rules?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it\nunless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human\ncan be bound in that way at a time. That's it.\" explained Nate.\n\nJack looked somewhat shocked. \"You mean that I could pull the lever now?\nYou'd let me end humanity?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate, \"if you want to.\" Nate looked at Jack carefully. \"Do\nyou want to, Jack?\"\n\n\"Umm, no.\" said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. \"Why in\nthe world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want\nthat! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too,\nwouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate, \"being as he'd be human too.\"\n\n\"Has anyone ever seriously considered it?\" asked Nate. \"Any of those bound\nto secrecy, that is?\"\n\n\"Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or\nanother. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and\nthink, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get\ndisgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while.\nBut he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here.\" Nate grinned some more.\n\nJack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at\nthe same time. After a bit, he said, \"So this makes me the Judge of\nhumanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?\"\n\n\"That seems to be it,\" agreed Nate.\n\n\"What kind of criteria do I use to decide?\" said Jack. \"How do I make this\ndecision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are\nbad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" replied Nate. \"You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's\nup to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed\nto know.\"\n\n\"But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel\nhorrible? Couldn't I make a mistake? How do I know that I won't screw up?\"\nprotested Jack.\n\nNate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. \"You don't. You just have to\ntry your best, Jack.\"\n\nJack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly\ngetting dark, chewing on a fingernail.\n\nSuddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. \"Nate, was Samuel the\none bound to this before me?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate. \"He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to\nread and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried\nin the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months\nago.\"\n\n\"Sounds like a good guy,\" agreed Jack. \"How did he handle this, when you\nfirst told him. What did he do?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Nate, \"he sat down for a while, thought about it for a bit, and\nthen asked me some questions, much like you're doing.\"\n\n\"What did he ask you, if you're allowed to tell me?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"He asked me about the third request,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"Aha!\" It was Jack's turn to grin. \"And what did you tell him?\"\n\n\"I told him the rules for the third request. That to get the third request\nyou have to agree to this whole thing. That if it ever comes to the point\nthat you really think that humanity should be ended, that you'll come here\nand end it. You won't avoid it, and you won't wimp out.\" Nate looked serious\nagain. \"And you'll be bound to do it too, Jack.\"\n\n\"Hmmm.\" Jack looked back out into the darkness for a while.\n\nNate watched him, waiting.\n\n\"Nate,\" continued Jack, quietly, eventually. \"What did Samuel ask for with\nhis third request?\"\n\nNate sounded like he was grinning again as he replied, also quietly,\n\"Wisdom, Jack. He asked for wisdom. As much as I could give him.\"\n\n\"Ok,\" said Jack, suddenly, standing up and facing away from Nate, \"give it\nto me.\n\nNate looked at Jack's backside. \"Give you what, Jack?\"\n\n\"Give me that wisdom. The same stuff that Samuel asked for. If it helped\nhim, maybe it'll help me too.\" Jack turned his head to look back over his\nshoulder at Nate. \"It did help him, right?\"\n\n\"He said it did,\" replied Nate. \"But he seemed a little quieter afterward.\nLike he had a lot to think about.\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, I can see that,\" said Jack. \"So, give it to me.\" Jack turned to\nface away from Nate again, bent over slightly and tensed up.\n\nNate watched Jack tense up with a little exasperation. If he bit Jack now,\nJack would likely jump out of his skin and maybe hurt them both.\n\n\"You remember that you'll be bound to destroy humanity if it ever looks like\nit needs it, right Jack?\" asked Nate, shifting position.\n\n\n\n\n[To the Comments!!!]",

When the chief explained the same task to him, the man sighed in relief, as blueberries would be no big deal. So he started sticking them in, and breezed through the first 7. But on the 8th berry, he burst out laughing and was killed and eaten. \n\nSo the first and second guy met up in heaven, and the first asked the second: \"What happened down there? You almost made it and then you just started laughing? \"\n\nThe second guy, with tears of laughter in his eyes, said \"I couldn't help it - I saw the last guy coming with pineapples.\"",

Great to see you! You and your friend come right in and join me for lunch!\"\n\nAlthough impressed, Bubba's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Bubba that he thinks Bubba's knowing Cruise was just lucky.\n\n\"No, no, just name anyone else,\" Bubba says.\n\n\"President Obama,\" his boss quickly retorts.\n\n\"Yes,\" Bubba says, \"I know him, let's fly out to Washington.\"\nAnd off they go. At the White House, Obama spots Bubba on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, \"Bubba, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a cup of coffee first and catch up.\"\n\nWell, the boss is very shaken by now, but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White house grounds, he expresses his doubts to Bubba, who again implores him to name anyone else.\n\n\"The Pope,\" his boss replies.\n\n\"Sure!\" says Bubba.\n\n\"My folks are from Argentina, and I've known the Pope a long time.\"\n\nSo off they fly to Rome. Bubba and his boss are assembled with the masses in Vatican Square when Bubba says, \"This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.\"\n\nAnd he disappears into the crowd headed toward the Vatican. Sure enough, half an hour later Bubba emerges with the Pope on the balcony. But by the time Bubba returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.\n\nWorking his way to his boss' side, Bubba asks him, \"What happened?\"\n\nHis boss looks up and says, \"I was doing fine until you and the Pope came out on the balcony and the man next to me said, \"Who's that on the balcony with Bubba?\"\n\n\nTL;DR: Bubba proves to his boss that he knows everyone.

In time, the friends reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across.. However, these friends were learned in the magical arts, and so the first friend waved his broken wand and made a potato. You see, that friend was kind of stupid. So the nerdy girl, after correcting her friend on the good way cast the spell, took out her wand with attitude and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water. They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure.\n\nAnd Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of three new victims, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three friends upon their magic and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him.\n\n\nSo the Ginger, who was a stupid man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence: a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death! So Death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river, fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the fool.\n\n\nThen the second friend, who was as arrogant as his father, decided that he wanted to humiliate Death still further, and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So Death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the friend with messy hair, and told him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead.\n\n\nAnd then Death asked the third and cleverest friend what he would like. The smart ass girl was the humblest and also the wisest of the friends, and she did not trust Death. So she asked for something that would enable her to go forth from that place without being followed by Death. And death, most unwillingly, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.\n\nThen Death stood aside and allowed the three friends to continue on their way, and they did so, talking with wonder of the adventure they had had, and admiring Death\u2019s gifts. In due course the friends separated, each for his own destination.\n\nThe first one traveled on for a week or more, and reaching a distant village, sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally with the Elder Wand as his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor, the first friend proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself, and of how it made him invincible.\n\nThat very night, another wizard crept upon the first friend as he lay, wine-sodden, upon his bed. The theif took the wand and, for good measure, slit the ginger's throat.\n\nAnd so Death took the first friend for his own.\n\nMeanwhile, the second one journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in his hand. To his amazement and his delight, the figure of his parents he wanted to know, before their untimely death, appeared at once before him.\n\nYet they were sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though they had returned to the mortal world, they did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the second friend, driven mad with hopeless longing, killed himself so as truly to join them.\n\nAnd so Death took the second friend for his own.\n\nBut though Death searched for the third friend for many years, he was never able to find her. You could think that Death couldn't see the muggle-born because of her magic Cloak, but why couldn't he hear her?\n\nThat's when Death himself learned, that he was deaf.\n",

Nobody actually new the French kid's name, but he was strange enough for people to make up their own. Creep, Emo, Lame-ass, Weirdo, and plenty of other (and much worse) names. As an extremely goth kid, he had the full goth getup. Black hair, eyeliner, weird piercings, ripped jeans, you get the picture. But what really made him stand out was this really big chain he wore everywhere. Always. It was his favorite accessory. And this kid really, I mean REALLY hated John. The goth kid fancied himself pretty smart, and thought he was much cooler than he really was. So he was really pissed when John became the class valedictorian. He needed some way to prove to the world that he was better than John. He began bragging to everyone about his parent's land back home in France, hoping to make John jealous. Now John wasn't really sure why, but the idea of a weird goth nobody trying to one-up him really got him mad. He needed some way to prove that he was, in fact, better than the goth kid. He did some research into his family tree to see if he was related to anyone famous, to prove that he was inherently better than the French goth. He struck gold! He discovered that he was the long-lost heir to some obscure duke or duchess in, of all places, France! John brought his proof that he was French royalty to school to show the goth kid how much better he was. Of course, the French kid called bull. John wouldn't take it and started claiming that the goth kid was making up all of his family's fortune. He went on a rant, trying to shame the goth kid by saying how he was just jealous that John had become valedictorian, and not him. This continued for weeks, and at the end of it all, they were both livid. They finally decided there was only way to solve this dispute. They would both go to France and prove their wealth to the other. They convinced their families to vacation there at the same time, and it actually worked! Even more weeks later, they were in the airport, going through security (separately, with their respective families). However, the goth kid had forgot how strict the TSA was, and had (as always) been wearing his favorite chain. He was forced to hand it over to airport security, who said he could get it back upon his return. It was a heart-wrenching experience for the kid, who was never without his trademark chain. But he had no choice but to hand it over. Upon arriving in France, he immediately sought out and bought the first chain he could find, much smaller and much more lackluster than his favorite. But he decided it would have to work for now. Although they couldn't yet meet face to face, he finally managed to coordinate a meeting with John over the phone, and they set off to show off their land to each other. The whole time, John was calling the goth kid all sorts of terrible names, partially due to his insecurity about the size of his land. If it was smaller than a lame goth kids, he wouldn't be able to live with himself. However, what both of the kids failed to realize was that John's dead ancestor lived on the property right next to the French kid's! They were finally about to meet, and got to thoroughly examine and compare their family's land beforehand. They set eyes on each other and calmly approached, determined at the last minute to settle this like civilized humans...\n\"Val. John, at last. We see each other's plains.\" \"Monsieur Lamer, you wear a different chain.\"",

We created a search engine for a PC, gave it a funny name, made whatever you search for open a browser in Internet Explorer (which we also gave a funny new name), and search for what you searched for through our other search engine Bing! Isn't that hilarious!?...I can just imagine the looks on people's faces when they click on the 'start' menu only to find a bunch of tiles.\" She admitted that the creation of Windows 10 was partially designed to force its users into not using anything Google related out of spite. When asked about the limited features of Windows 10 that even Windows 8 and 8.1 users found convenient she responded, \"Well it's not a complete OS. The control panel is only 50% of what it used to be, so we didn't include many customization options or the ability to not automatically install updates. We wouldn't make a complete OS just for a joke.\" In fact, upon further discussion, it was revealed that the option to not automatically install updates was intentionally removed from Windows 10 for the *Joke Repairment Program (JRP)* which will be automatically downloaded to desktops running Windows 10 that will restore each system to its former OS. \"It wasn't just that we were bored,\" Hayswitt said about the purpose of Windows 10, \"We wanted to give our customers a good laugh, but at the same time I think it serves another purpose. Since most people took it seriously, Windows 10 makes previous Windows OSs shine like never before. Maybe once the JRP is all said and done, people will look at their old operating systems in a new light and appreciate the little features and functions they took for granted.\"",

On the day the proxy father was to arrive, Mr. Smith kissed his wife goodbye and said, 'Well, I'm off now. The man should be here soon.'\n\nHalf an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby photographer happened to ring the doorbell, hoping to make a sale. 'Good morning, Ma'am,' he said, 'I've come to...'\n\n'Oh, no need to explain,' Mrs. Smith cut in, embarrassed, 'I've been expecting you.' \n\n'Have you really?' said the photographer. 'Well, that's good. Did you know babies are my specialty?'\n\n'Well that's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat!'\n\nAfter a moment she asked, blushing, 'Well, where do we start?'\n\n'Leave everything to me.. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. And sometimes the living room floor is fun. You can really spread out there.'\n\n'Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work out for Harry and me!'\n\n'Well, Ma'am, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.'\n\n'My, that's a lot!' gasped Mrs. Smith.\n\n'Ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. I'd love to be In and out in five minutes, but I'm sure you'd be disappointed with that.'\n\n'Don't I know it,' said Mrs. Smith quietly.\n\nThe photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. 'This was done on the top of a bus,' he said.\n\n'Oh, my God!' Mrs. Smith exclaimed, grasping at her throat.\n\n'And these twins turned out exceptionally well - when you consider their mother was so difficult to work with..'\n\n'She was difficult?' asked Mrs. Smith.\n\n'Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look.'\n\n'Four and five deep?' said Mrs. Smith, her eyes wide with amazement.\n\n'Yes,' the photographer replied. 'And for more than three hours, too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling. I could hardly concentrate, and when darkness approached I had to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just had to pack it all in.'\n\nMrs. Smith leaned forward. 'Do you mean they actually chewed on your, uh...equipment?'\n\n'It's true, Ma'am, yes.. Well, if you're ready, I'll set-up my tripod and we can get to work right away.'\n\n'Tripod?'\n\n'Oh yes, Ma'am. I need to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much too big to be held in the hand very long.'\n\nMrs. Smith fainted.",

A cat wandered by, heard the noise, and dug through the manure until he found the bird and ate him.  The moral of this story is:\n \n   1.

I was born without a body.\n\nIt doesn't hurt, except when I try to breathe. The doctors gave me an artificial body. It is a burlap bag filled with leaves. The doctors said that was the best they could do on account of us having no money or insurance. I would like to have a body transplant, but we need more money.\n\nMommy doesn't work because she said nobody hires crying people. I said, \"Don't cry, Mommy,\" and she hugged my burlap bag. Mommy always gives me hugs, even though she's allergic to burlap and it makes her sneeze and chafes her real bad.\n\nI hope you will help me. You can help me if you forward this email to everyone you know. Forward it to people you don't know, too. Dr. Johansen said that for every person you forward this email to, Bill Gates will team up with AOL and send a nickel to NASA. With that funding, NASA will collect prayers from school children all over America and have the astronauts take them up into space so that the angels can hear them better. Then they will come back to earth and go to the Pope, and he will take up a collection in church and send all the money to the doctors. The doctors could help me get better then.\n\nMaybe one day I will be able to play baseball. Right now I can only be third base.\n\nEvery time you forward this letter, the astronauts can take more prayers to the angels and my dream will be closer to coming true.\n\nPlease help me. Mommy is so sad, and I want a body. I don't want my leaves to rot before I turn ten. If you don't forward this email, that's okay. Mommy says you're a mean and heartless nasty person who doesn't care about a poor little boy with only a head. She says that if you don't stew in the raw pit of your own guilt-ridden stomach, she hopes you die a long slow horrible death and then burn forever in hell.\n\nWhat kind of cruel person are you that you can't take five minutes to forward this to all your friends so that they can feel guilt and shame about ignoring a poor, bodiless nine-year-old boy?\n\nPlease help me. I try to be happy, but it's hard.\n\nI wish I had a kitty.\n\nI wish I could hold a kitty.\n\nI wish I could hold a kitty that wouldn't chew on me and try to bury its poo in the leaves of my burlap body. I wish that very much.\n\nThank You,\n\nBilly \"Smiley\" Evans",

Life was good again, until several years later, husband number two also passed.\n\nShortly thereafter the woman succumbed    to the heartache of finding and then losing true love twice and she passes away.\n\nDuring the eulogy at her funeral, the pastor spoke the phrase, \"finally, they are together again.\"\n\nCurious, all twelve of the woman's children approached the pastor after the service. Speaking for the entire group, the eldest child asked, \"Reverend, when you said, 'they are together again,' did you mom was with our father or theirs?\"\n\n\"Neither,\" he replied, \"I was talking about her knees.\"",

Soon, Mr. Jones nodded off again. Again, the minister noticed. \"Who is your redeemer?\" he asked the congregation, motioning towards Mrs. Jones.\n\"God!\" Mr. Jones cried out as he was stuck again with the hatpin.\n\"Right again,\" said the minister, smiling. Before long, Mr. Jones again winked off. However, this time the minister did not notice. As he picked up the tempo of his sermon, he made a few motions that Mrs. Jones mistook as signals to bayonet her husband with the hatpin again.\nThe minister asked, \"And what did Eve say to Adam after she bore him his 99th son?\"\nMrs. Jones poked her husband, who yelled, \"You stick that goddamned thing in me one more time and I'll break it in half and shove it up your ass!\"\n\"Amen,\" replied the congregation.",

        "body": "Timmy's best friend was his dog. His dog was his only friend when his dad got a new job and they had to relocate. His dog was there to scare away the bullies when he was an awkward kid in school. Timmy's dog was even there as a shoulder to cry on when Timmy had his first broken heart.  They grew from boy and pup to dog and man. They were as close as any man and beast have ever been. \n\nOne day, as Timmy was out on a walk down the road with his faithful companion, a car lost control and headed straight for the pair. Though it happened in an instant, the moment occurred in slow motion. Timmy's dog barked fiercely at the oncoming car as Timmy froze in fear. The instant before the vehicle impacted, his dog lunged and knocked his master from the 2.5 ton 3.5 liter moving mass of death.\n\nTears rolled down poor Timmy's face as he stared in disbelief. His faithful companion let out an innocent whimper as Timmy scooped his broken, canine body from the pavement. \n\nThe vet was 2 miles away and Timmy reached it and burst through the door and screamed for help. \"My dog!\" He cried like a man posessed. \"A car . . .my dog. . . Help me!\" They hurried him into the back room and laid his dog across the table to let the veterinarian perform his miracle. \n\nThe vet was solemn as he looked at the young man and said, \"I'm sorry son, your dog is dead.\" Timmy stared in disbelief. He choked his responses, repeating, \"No, no! I want more tests. I want a second opinion.\"\n\nThe vet shrugged his shoulders and left the room. He came back with an old tabby cat. He placed the cat on the end of the table and the tabby walked over Timmy's dog, pawing him every couple steps. Finally he looked at the veterinarian and let out an emphatic, \" Mrrooowwwrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.\"\n\nThe vet assistant had to hold Timmy back from his rage, \"What the hell? Do some tests, you son of a bitch! Where's the second opinion?\" The doctor shrugged and left the room again and a silence settled for a moment. \n\nHe came back with an old, blind Labrador. The Labrador sniffed Timmy's dog and barked at the lifeless body. Finally it hung it's head and whimpered. The doctor laid a gentle hand on Timmy's shoulder and said, \"It's been confirmed son. This dog is dead.\"\n\nThe disbelief on Timmy's face was obvious. \"What are you doing?\" He screamed. \"I suppose you expect me to pay you for this?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the vet said plainly, \"this will be $2050.\" Timmy couldn't believe it. \"Are you insane!?!\" he screamed. \"How did this cost $2050!?!\" The veterinarian shrugged and said, \"Well, my fee is $50. Then there's $2000 for the cat scan and lab test.\"\n",

It's way better in person, but gives me a little chuckle every time :)\n\n***\n\nA man goes out for a few beers after a long day at work. He sits at the bar alone for some time before making idle conversation with the new barkeep who'd just begun a shift. They exchange stories, as the man himself once tended bar in his younger days, and he continues to drink. 3AM rolls around before he knows it and his new friend The Bartender tells him it's time to pack it in. \n\n\"Alright Buddy, it's been fun, but I gotta close up.\" \n\nThe man smiles, clumsily grabs his wallet from his back pocket and throws a twenty down on the table. He thanks The Bartender for the good conversation and swings around on the stool before falling flat on his face. He looks to the door and thinks to himself that if he can just get outside and get some fresh air, he'll be alright. So he crawls across the room, unnoticed by The Bartender as he counts out his till, and shimmies up the doorway. With a quick turn of the knob, the door lurches forward and the man finds himself making quick friends with the sidewalk. \n\n\"Fuck!\" He shouts as he lifts himself by his elbows. It's quite dark out and the only real good source of light is coming from a streetlight across and down the road a ways. He begins his exciting crawl. Once he reaches the streetlight he pulls himself up again, readying himself for the walk home, before falling forward once more. \n\n\"That's it!\" He figures he's had far too many drinks this evening, and makes the genius decision to crawl home. \n\nLuckily the man doesn't live too far away and it's not long before he sees his house just down the street. He continues his crawl, up the street, past the ratty shack his neighbours call home, and across his lawn. He pulls himself up the stairs to his front porch, grabs the doorknob and pulls himself upright, pushing the door forward and, again, falling flat on his face. \n\nThe man figures he's had just about enough of this tonight, nudges the door shut behind him, and lets his head rest on one of his slippers in the entrance way before slipping off into dreamland. \n\nThe smell of fresh coffee and the sound of birds chirping and dishes clanging seem to wake the man up all at once. He aches all over and can't quite recall why he's slept on the floor in the entranceway of his house. His wife rounds the corner from the kitchen with a mug of steaming hot coffee in her hands.\n\n\"Good Morning,\" she begins, with a crooked smile on her face. \"A nice man named Frank called, he works at the bar you were at last night.\" \n\nSilence. The man readies himself for a good, stern talking to.\n\nShe places the coffee down beside her husband and gives him a gentle pat on the back. \"You forgot your wheelchair there last night.\" ",

This goes on\nthroughout the meal.\n\nLater, when the youngster and the\noldtimer get back to their cell,\nthe young man asks, \"What was going in\nthe mess hall tonight? I\nthought you said there was no talking\nallowed.\"\n\"Ah, yes, the mess hall. Well years ago,\nthe warden eased up on\nthat rule a bit, the one that disallows\ntalking at meals. You see,\nall of us inmates have memorized a long\nlist of jokes and stories\nby the number, so that all one of us has to\ndo is call out its\nnumber, and, because we have all of the\nstories memorized, it's\nlike someone told the whole funny story.\"\nThe young inmate nods understandingly\nand falls off to sleep.\n\nAfter a few weeks of this mealtime\nbehavior, the young man gets\nup a bit of nerve and decides to tell a\nstory.\n\nSo, one evening at the dinner meal, he\nstands up and loudly says,\n\"26.\" No one laughs. Not even a twitter.\nSo he tries again, \"26.\"\nStill nothing. He sits down sheepishly and\nembarrassed.\n\nLater, he pleads with the oldtimer to\nexplain what happened.\n\"That is such a good story, number 26, how\ncome no one laughed.\"\nThe old man turned to him and explained,\n\"It's the way you told it.\"\n",

The governor starts to intervene, but reflects upon the movie Bambi and then realizes he should stop because the coyote is only doing what is natural.\n\n   He calls animal control. Animal control captures the coyote and bills the state $200 for testing it for diseases and $500 for relocating it. He calls a veterinarian. The vet collects the dead dog and bills the state $200 for testing it for diseases. The governor goes to the hospital and spends $3,500 getting checked for diseases from the coyote and getting his bite wound bandaged.\n\n   The running trail gets shut down for six months while the California Fish and Game Department conducts a $100,000 survey to make sure the area is now free of dangerous animals. The governor spends $50,000 in state funds implementing a 'coyote awareness program' for residents of the area. The Legislature spends $2 million to study how to better treat rabies and how to permanently eradicate the disease throughout the world.\nThe governor's security agent is fired for not stopping the attack. The state spends $150,000 to hire and train a new agent with additional special training, re: the nature of coyotes. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) protests the coyote's relocation and files a $5 million suit against the state.\n\n   The governor of Texas is jogging with his dog along a nature trail. A coyote jumps out and tries to attack him and his dog. The governor shoots the coyote with his state-issued pistol and keeps jogging.\n\n   The governor spent 50 cents on a .380-caliber, hollow-point cartridge. Buzzards ate the dead coyote.\n\n   And that, my friends, is why California is broke and Texas is not.\n\n\nSource: http://economy.money.cnn.com/2012/10/10/california-texas-richard-fisher/\n\n",

Whoever had the worst luck will get in to Heaven.\n\nSo the first man tells his story.\n\n> I married the love of my life.  But she was too good looking for me.  So I worked 60 hours a week to give her a good life.  But because I worked so much, we barely got to be together and rarely had sex.  After a while I had a hunch she was cheating on me.  So I left work early one day and came home to our beautiful condo in our high rise building.  When I entered, she was in the shower.  So I snooped around thinking I'd find some evidence of a man being there.  I looked everywhere but there was no evidence of another man in the condo.  Distraught that I could think so low of the love of my life, I went out to our balcony to think everything over.  But when I got out there, I saw a pair of hands hanging on to the ledge.  I knew this must be the man my wife was cheating with.  So I stomped his hands until he fell to the ground.  But he wasn't dead.  So I went inside and found the biggest thing I could throw off the ledge... The fridge.  I threw it down and crushed him.  Knowing the love of my life was unfaithful, I decided to take my own life.  I shot myself, and next thing I know, I'm up here talking to you.\n\nThe second man immediately starts his story:\n\n> Well!... I was working out on my treadmill as I always do.  But it was extremely hot in my condo, so I went to open the window and fell out.  I thought I was going to die, but luckily I was able to grab the ledge of the balcony below mine.  I was hanging there trying to pull myself up, when a crazy man started stomping my hands.  I held on as hard as I could, but I fell to the ground.  I thought I was dead.  But I survived the fall.  But just when I was thanking my lucky stars, I look up to see a fridge falling from the sky.  Next thing I know, I'm up here talking to you.\n\nThe third man finally gets to tell his story:\n\n> Well, there I am, naked, sitting in some guys refrigerator...\n",

The assembly line foreman comes in and starts ranting about this new employee. He says she's incredibly slow, and the whole line is backing up.\n\nThe foreman takes the personnel manager down to the factory floor to show him the problem. Sure enough, Elmos are backed up all over the place.\n\nAt the end of the line is the new employee. She has a roll of the material used for the Elmos and a big bag of marbles. They both watch as she cuts a little piece of fabric, wraps it around two marbles, and starts sewing the little package between Elmo's legs.\n\nThe personnel manager starts laughing hysterically. After several minutes, he pulls himself together, walks over to the woman, and says, \"I'm sorry, I guess you misunderstood me yesterday. Your job is to give Elmo two test tickles.\"\n\n[Credit to this website](http://tcrc.acor.org/jokeframe.html?joke=joke28)",

I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mum and you. I've been finding real passion with Stacy, and she is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of her piercings, tattoos, tight motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older than I am. But it's not only the passion, Dad. She's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children. Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves, and trading it with the other people in the commune, for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want. In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS, so Stacy can get better. She sure deserves it! Don't worry, Dad. I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself. Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit, so you can get to know your many grandchildren. Love, your son, Joshua. P.S. Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Jason's house.

I'm just finishing my beer first, then I leave!\"\n\nThe bartender leaves him behind. Our hero takes his last sip, when he notices a stranger standing in the doorway. He thinks to himself \"Well, this is it, I'm done for it\". But the stranger just walks up to him, takes his cock out of his pants and says\n\n\"Suck it!\"\n\nWell, our hero doesn't want no harm, so he proceeds to do so. Shortly the stranger says\n\n\"Faster!\"\n\nThe man does so. But the stranger urges him to do it faster again.\n\n\"Come on! Faster! Quick!\"\n\nThe man spits out the stranger's weener and says\n\n\"Why do you have to be so God damn impatient??\"\n\n\"We don't have time! Didn't you hear?

Her soul arrived up in heaven where she was met at the Gates of Heaven by St. Peter himself.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Heaven,\u201d said St. Peter. \u201cBefore you get settled in though, it seems we have a problem. You see, strangely enough, we\u2019ve never once had someone like you make it this far and we\u2019re not really sure what to do with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo problem, just let me in\u201d said the woman. \u201cWell, I\u2019d like to, but I have higher orders. What we\u2019re going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, I think I\u2019ve made up my mind, I prefer to stay in Heaven\u201d, said the woman. \u201cSorry, we have rules...\u201d And with that St. Peter put the executive in an elevator and it went down down down to hell. The doors opened and she found herself stepping out onto the putting green of a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a clubhouse and standing in front of her were all her friends - fellow executives that she had worked with and they were all dressed in evening gowns and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks and they talked about old times. They played an excellent round of golf and at night went to the clubhouse where she enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil who was actually a really nice guy (kinda cute, he always is) and she had a great time telling jokes and dancing. She was having such a good time that before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everybody shook her hand and waved goodbye as she got on the elevator The elevator went up-up-up and opened back up at the Gates of Heaven and she found St. Peter waiting for her.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time to spend a day in heaven,\u201d he said. So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing the harp and singing. She had a great time and before she knew it her 24 hours were up and St. Peter came and got her. \u201cSo, you\u2019ve spent a day in hell and you\u2019ve spent a day in heaven. Now you must choose your eternity,\u201d he said.\n\nThe woman paused for a second and then replied, \u201cWell, I never thought I\u2019d say this, I mean, Heaven has been really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell.\u201d So St. Peter escorted her to the elevator and again she went down down down back to Hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks. The Devil came up to her and put his arm around her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d stammered the woman, \u201cyesterday I was here and there was a golf course and a clubhouse and we ate lobster and we danced and had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.\u201d\n\nThe Devil looked at her and smiled. \u201cYesterday we were recruiting you, today.....you\u2019re staff.",

There was a bear in the stream, catching fish.  So I waded out to him, and baptized the bear right there, and so converting him.\"\n\nThe priest and minster look over to the rabbi, and this guy is in rough shape.

You're going to need it.\"\n\nA month later, the man again came in for his regular haircut.

They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us the presidential suite at no extra charge!\"\n\n\"Well,\" muttered the barber, \"I know you didn't get to see the Pope.\"\n\n\"Actually, we were quite lucky, for as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the pope likes to personally meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait, the pope would personally greet me. Sure enough, five minutes later the pope walked through the door and shook my hand! I knelt down as he spoke a few words to me.\"\n\n\"Really?\" asked the Barber. \"What'd he say?\"\n\nHe said, \"Where'd you get the shitty haircut?\"\n\ncourtesy of planet-38",

My own son has just converted to Christianity! Come with me, we'll catch a plane to Jerusalem and get this sorted out.\"\n\nSo, all three rabbis fly from the US to Jerusalem. They find the oldest, wisest rabbi they can, and in unison, cry out \"Rabbi, rabbi! Our sons have converted to Christianity! Whatever shall we do?\" And the old rabbi says \"Funny you should ask! My own son has just converted to Christianity! Come, let us go to the Wailing Wall. God will surely have an answer to such a conundrum.\"\n\nSo, all four rabbis run as fast as they can to the Wailing Wall and drop to their knees, shouting to the sky \"Holy father!

I watch him fall but he landed in bushes and he's getting up! He was fine! I was fuming!!!! I ran in, grabbed the fridge and threw it down on top of the tos*er and killed him!

I'm screaming at him to stop and he did and I almost get up but he starts smackin me wit a hammer! so i had to let go.

He had been there for a while and was longing to liven up his stay there so he decided to enter the next one. There was a shop in town that he could buy sculpting supplies from and the guys in command had given him a few days before his next assignment, so he rode in on his trusty mule and came back with all of the chisels and saws he needed.\n\nThat evening, the SEAL started work on his masterpiece. He loved sites like reddit and imgur, so naturally he decided to sculpt a life sized Good Guy Greg. Both day and night he worked at it until it came to the day of the ice sculpting competition.\n\nThere were some good sculptures at the event, but the judges loved his work so much that the SEAL won first prize. To celebrate, he went hard out on the town with some of the locals.\n\nA few hours later, despite being nearly blind drunk, he remembered he'd left his statue and mule outside. There was a blizzard due that evening and his trusty pet would surely die if he didn't get back in time.\n\nThe navy SEAL stumbled back as soon as a drunk man could and with his stomach turning and his head spinning, he set to loading up the sculpture onto the sled.\n\nJust as he'd got one foot of the sculpture on the sled, he slipped, lost balance and fell to the ground, with 150kg of ice crashing down square on his shin. He was trapped underneath.\n\nDespite the numbing whisky in his system, a terrible shooting pain raced up his leg. It must be broken. The SEAL remembered his training and tried not to panic, but the sculpture was impossible to lift. He called his mule over to try and budge it. No such luck.\n\n\"If only there was a way I could make it lighter\", thought the SEAL. Then, an idea hit him. All he'd have to do is heat up the ice sculpture and then it would just melt away until he was able to lift it.\n\nHe started to breathe heavily into the ice, but to no avail. He emptied his bladder, but that only froze and made things worse. With his last throw of the dice, he beckoned his trusty mule over and got him to lie down on the ice, hoping his body heat would lessen the load, even slightly. The wind picked up and snow was falling so quickly that he could barely see outline of his pet, doing all that he could to save his master.\n\nHe waited. Nothing. He gave it some more time. Nothing. He tried to hold out for longer. Nothing. The sculpture was no lighter and he was drifting in and out of consciousness.\n\nSuddenly, a chilling thought hit him. His heart pounded against his chest and a cold sweat broke across his brow as he realised that it was all over. He realised... \n\n\n...that pet mules can't melt SEAL memes.",

He found a strange attraction and started to get.......\n..... Started to get an erection... He couldn't in the slightest bit understand what it was about this 1 man, but this man was the 1. The way his over sized shlonge hung down the side, and how hard it got when he slowly licked from the base to the tip. The other man awoke with a \"the fuck?\" Then looked down and smiled a nasty grin.......\n.... nasty grin. It was SUCH a turn on, and the man knew it. The man grabbed Jimmys hair and slammed his massive cock into his mouth, hearing a gurgle sound he let off, but not by much. Slamming and yanking his head up and down, faster and faster. Jimmys throat started to burn but he was happy to do it for this man alone! Feeling it cumming (see what I did there ;D) he braced himself as his hips forced up. A dark \"uhhhh!\" Came from deep below as Jimmys mouth was flooded with Jizz, so much that he almost gagged........\nGagged.... Jimmy couldn't help himself but to spit it out immediately. All the goop spilling out on his shlonge and pubes. Feeling a slight embarrassment he started licking it off his dick and pulling it out of his pubes with his teeth. Not spitting out the few that stayed in his mouth, he then swallowed it, pubes and all! A slight disgust filled his stomach, but he was ok. It then occurred to him \"oh shit! Does he have the HIVA-CLAPA-ARIA!?!?\" But the man read his mind and assured him he was clean. As the man put his cock away and stood up to leave Jimmy had to ask \"What is your name?\" The man smirked and said \"the names Pan....... Peter... Pan....\" As Peter walked out the door and slid his gay green hat on he stood a faggot pose and then....... Flew off to never land.....\nNever land........ The next day Jimmy woke up from a raging boner that wouldn't subside. Giving up \"fuck it\" he climbed out of bed and poured a bowl of dick flavored Cheerios. He sat down on his couch and turned on NBC. The headline \"MORE BULLSHIT IN SYRIA\" ran across the top of the screen, then on the small scroll said \"new information... Bush Did 9/11\" and then... \"BREAKING NEWS!!! New reports claim that child molester Michael Jackson has been dressing up in a (gay) Peter Pan costume and forcing (gay) \"young people\" to do sexual acts to him. If you know anything of this please tell local authorities, if you have been abused by Michael please burn your mouth.\" Jimmy then climbed to the crest of the valley, pulled his dick out and belly flopped 20 stories onto his dick which exploded and covered all of Candy Land in Jizz. \n\nThe End...\n\nP.S. PCP is an awesome drug baby (wink wink)",

Now Sunday comes around and the armless man is standing at the top of the belltower looking at the bell.  He has no idea how in the world he is going to ring this thing.  Time is ticking away as mass is rapidly approaching.  Finally time runs out and with no better ideas he sprints at full speed and smashes his face into the bell.  The bell rings out with a loud (DONG).  the bell however needs to be rung three times for mass.  The armless man backs up and repeats the process two more times.  This goes on for weeks and the job is taking it's toll.  His face is covered in welts bruises lumps and cuts.  He is now seeing three bells.

He shoots off the edge of the belltower and falls all the way down to the ground (SPLAT).  The entire congregation gathers round the body.

        "body": "Once, before the age of the internet, there was a boy by the name of Johnny. He was about 7, and went to kindergarten. Every day, little Johnny would ride the bus to and from school. And boy, did he love riding the bus. You see, he shared the bus ride with his best friend and pseudo-mentor, Joe. Now Joe was a cool teenager; he was a high schooler, and even had a girlfriend! Joe was everything Johnny aspired to be and more.\n\nOne morning, Johnny sat down on the bus and waited eagerly for Joe\u2019s stop. As the bus slowed to a stop, Johnny got up on his knees in order to see Joe. Joe, cool as ever, waited with his hands in his pockets and leaning on a wall. He looked at Johnny as he entered the bus and Johnny saw that Joe wore the biggest smile on his face that Johnny had ever seen! So when Joe sat down, little Johnny asked Joe, \u201cHey Joe, what happened to you? Why are you so happy?\u201d \n\nAnd Joe, he looked around to check if anyone was paying attention, got really close to Johnny, and whispered in his ear, \u201cI did something with my girlfriend last night for the first time.\u201d Johnny giggled and asked what it was. Joe looked around again, and, as if he were afraid to exclaim it, ripped out a small piece of paper and wrote, \u201cI gave my girlfriend the Pink Feather!\u201d before letting Johnny read it and swallowing it to destroy the evidence.\n\nNow Johnny was just a kid; he didn\u2019t know what the Pink Feather was, so he shyly voiced his innocent question, \u201cJoe, what\u2019s the Pink Feather?\u201d And little Johnny was met with the coldest, emotionless gaze from Joe which Johnny could feel piercing his soul. \n\nJoe told Johnny, \u201cLook Johnny, I know we\u2019ve been friends for a long time, but I just can\u2019t hang out with a kid so ignorant. As of right now, you\u2019re dead to me. We\u2019re never talking again.\u201d \n\nAnd Johnny froze. Was this some sort of joke? Did Joe really mean they wouldn\u2019t be friends anymore? Was this all because of that Pink Feather? They sat in silence until the bus stopped in front of the elementary school. Johnny had to climb over Joe, who wouldn\u2019t even make eye contact with the poor kid. \u201cB-bye Joe.. See you after school, ok?\u201d\n\nAt school, Johnny eventually came to the conclusion that there\u2019d be no way that Joe would stop being his friend over something so silly. He\u2019d either get over it, or reveal the cruel joke after a few days. So that afternoon, Johnny waited for Joe on the bus. Joe sat far away from Johnny, not even casting a glance in his direction. It hurt, but Johnny knew it\u2019d be ok soon enough.\n\nA few days went by without any contact between the two. Eventually Joe stopped taking the bus altogether. He probably got a ride from one of his high school friends. That day at school, Johnny was visibly distraught. The weight of losing his best friend came crashing down on him, and he couldn\u2019t bear the pain anymore. Johnny cried and cried, and a teacher had to pull him outside to ask what was wrong.\n\nHe whined, \u201cMuh-my friend\u2026 Joe.. He.. He said he wouldn\u2019t be my friend no more!\u201d\n\nThe teacher crouched down to get at eye level and asked him, \u201cWhy\u2019s that Johnny? I couldn\u2019t imagine anyone not wanting to be friends with such a polite kid as you!\u201d\n\nAnd Johnny said, \u201cbecause.. I.. I didn\u2019t know what the Pink Feather was!\u201d And his teacher stood straight up. She was disgusted with Johnny and sent him to the Principal\u2019s Office without another word. He waited for hours, saw his teacher come by after class and leave, giving him a dirty look, and Johnny waited some more. Eventually his parents came by to pick him up! They sat with Johnny, and his father told him, \u201cyou are in a lot of trouble young man! Just wait until the principal tells us what you did!\u201d\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, Johnny and his parents were called into the office where the principal told them that Johnny had a foul mouth, but the teacher refused to repeat what Johnny said. They asked Johnny to repeat it and Johnny slowly said, \u201cI just said that, because of the Pink Feather, Jo-\u201c\n\nJohnny was interrupted twofold when his mother started bawling, and when his father immediately covered Johnny\u2019s mouth and gave him a few spankings right there in the principal\u2019s office. The principal exclaimed, \u201cwe don\u2019t tolerate this kind of behavior here. Get that child out of here and don\u2019t bring him back! I\u2019ll make sure no school in the state will school him!\u201d\n\nSo Johnny went home and was sent straight into his room. He heard his parents scream at each other for a long time, and heard his name quite a bit as well as a lot of words he didn\u2019t recognize. Johnny was scared to death and could barely sleep at all that night.\n\nThe following morning, Johnny\u2019s father woke him up with a bucket of ice water and immediately started to explain, \u201cJohnny, your mother and I have had a long discussion and she can\u2019t handle having raised a monster such as you. So we\u2019re sending you to a therapeutic boarding school until you\u2019re ready to live by yourself. This is goodbye Johnny; we have a driver outside waiting to take you away.\u201d\n\nSo little 7-year-old Johnny had to say good-bye to his father for good (his mother wouldn\u2019t see him out), and move to a boarding school. It was at this point that Johnny vowed never to mention the Pink Feather ever again. So he went through school, living with troubled kids, and eventually received a GED without any more trouble from the Pink Feather. He even made it into college! \n\nWithout a place to go home to, Johnny moved into the dorms and met his roommate, Steve. Steve was a pretty friendly, but quiet guy, and they both got along great. In fact, they shortly became best friends. They were inseparable all throughout their undergrad years, and Johnny even came to Steve\u2019s home for holidays and vacations. They both decided to continue their education and receive a PhD, so they stayed close friends for many more years. \n\nOne day, Steve decided to ask Johnny a question that had been pressing at his mind (and that Johnny avoided) for a long time, \u201cJohnny. Why don\u2019t you have friends from your childhood? Why don\u2019t you ever go home to visit your parents?\u201d\n\nJohnny sighed, took a good moment to muster up the courage, and Steve continued, \u201cJohnny, we\u2019ve been best friends for almost 10 years now. You can tell me anything.\u201d\n\nWith this, Johnny was satisfied that he could share his deepest darkest secret with Steve. \u201cWhen I was a child, I was kicked out of public school and disowned by my parents because I talked about the Pink Feather.

One day, she wore her favorite velvet dress (she doesn't wear it when I come over because she doesn't want to rip it) and told me that she was tired of coke and wanted something else. Luckily, I knew this kid at school who made meth (He'd stay late and sneak into the lab to make it, and he even said that he has his own \"family recipe\" and bought some off him. After we took some of it in her bedroom the last thing I remember was telling her that she bloomed like a rose after she ripped her velvet dress trying to take it off. The sex part was blurry, but I remember what happened afterwards; She told me that I fell asleep while banging her. I said goodbye (she wasn't listening though), put on my clothes, and left.\n\nFast forward to now: We've both quit the habit, and I was able to find the girl's contact info (she works for a big-name company now) so I called her up. After a while she brought up the incident above, and we began talking about our teenage druggie days. I wanted to meet up with her, and asked her about her parent's house. Apparently the area around it got renovated (new layout and everything), but her house is still where it always was. Since she visited it regularly, I asked,\n\n>How do I get back there to the place where I fell asleep inside you?\n\n>How do I get myself back to the place where you said,\n\n>I want something else to get me through this semi-charmed kinda life",

No trucks, no trains no puzzles?\" The boy said \"No, just a pink ping pong ball.\n\nSo the father gets him the pink ping pong ball and wraps it up. The boy is absolutely delighted. He takes the pink ping pong ball to his room, and the pink ping pong ball is never seen again.\n\nA day before his 15th birthday, asked by his father, `Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?' \n\nThe son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. \n\nFinally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have five pink ping pong balls.\n\nThe father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is pink ping pong balls that you want, a pink ping pong balls you shall have. \n\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday presents five pink ping pong balls. \n\nThe boy took the pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong balls were gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. \n\nThe next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. \n\n`Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. He said therefore, `If it is a ten pack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a ten pack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' \n\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a ten pack of pink ping pong balls. \n\nThe boy took the ten pack of pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ping pong ball remained, merely the empty husk of the ten pack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. \n\nThe next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. \n\n`Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' \n\n`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. \n\n`I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' \n\nAnd so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. \n\nThe boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. \n\n`Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' \n\nThe son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humor me, dear father.' \n\nThe carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. \n\nThe next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. \n\n`Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' \n\nOne of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humor his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. \n\nThe next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. \n\nThe following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. \n\nThe following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. \n\n`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' \n\nIt was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. \n\nThe next day, the father took his son to the harbor and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. \n\n`Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' \n\nThat night, the son spent on board the tanker. \n\nThe next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. \n\nA few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. \n\nHis father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' \n\nWeakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' \n\n`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' \n\nThe father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. \n\nSon, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.\n\nThe son nodded weakly. \n\nThe next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. \n\nNow, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls, the father requested. \n\nThe son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. \n\n`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. \n\n`I- I-' \n\nThen he died.

After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard.          \n\nSo they pulled into a nearby farm and asked the attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night.    \n                      \n'I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all to myself, but I'm recently widowed,' she explained,' and I'm afraid the neighbours will talk if I let you stay in my house.'\n                                      \n'Don't worry,' John said. 'We'll be happy to sleep in the barn.    And  if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light.'\n                              \nThe lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night.\n                               \nCome morning,  the weather had cleared, and they got on their way.           \n                       \nThey enjoyed a great weekend of golf.                      \n           \nBut about nine months later, John got an unexpected letter from an attorney.          \n                       \nIt took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the golf weekend.                           \n\nHe dropped in on his friend Shawn and asked,  \"Shawn, do you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our golf holiday in Scotland about 9 months ago?'                         \n\n'Yes, I do,'  said Shawn.

One day he took his\nquestions to his mother, and she became flustered. Instead of explaining\nthings to Johnny she told him to hide behind the curtains one night and\nwatch his older sister and her boyfriend. This he did, and the following\nmorning Johnny described everything to his mother.\n\nSis and her boyfriend sat and talked for awhile, then he turned off\nmost of the lights. Then he started to kiss and hug her, I figured sis\nmust be getting sick because her face started looking funny. He must have\nthought so too because he put his hand inside her blouse to feel her heart,\njust like the doctor would. Except he's not as good as the doctor, because\nhe seemed to have trouble finding her heart.\n\nHe was getting sick too, because pretty soon both of them started\npanting and getting all out of breath. His other hand must have been getting\ncold because he put it under her skirt. About this time, sis got toward the\nend of the couch. This was when the fever started. I know it was a fever\nbecause sis told him she was really HOT.\n\nFinally, I found out what was making them so sick.... a big eel had\ngotten inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his pants and stood\nthere about 9 inches long. HONEST! anyway, he grabbed it in one hand to keep\nit from getting away. When sis saw it she got really scared. Her eyes big\nand her mouth fell open, and she started calling out to God and stuff\nlike that. I should tell her about the ones I saw at the lake!\n\n\"Anyway\", sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by bitting its head\noff. All of a sudden, she made a noise and let the eel go... I guess it bit\nher back. Then she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he\ntook a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eels head to keep\nit from biting again.\n\nSis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor lock on\nit. And he helped by laying on the top of the eel. The eel put up a hell\nof a fight. Sis started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost\nupset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squishing it between\nthem.\n\nAfter a while they both quit moving and gave a great sigh. Her\nboyfriend sat up and sure enough they had killed the eel... I knew it was\ndead because it just hung there limp and some of its insides were hanging\nout. Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the battle, but they\nwent on courting anyway. He started hugging and kissing her again. And by\ngolly, the eel wasn't dead after all. It jumped straight up and started to\nfight again.\n\nI guess eels are like cats.... they have nine lives or something.\nThis time sis jumped up and tried to kill the eel by sitting on it. After\nabout 35 minutes of struggle, they finally killed the eel. I know it was\ndead this time because I saw sis's boyfriend peel off the skin and flush\nit down the toilet.\n\nMother fainted.\n",

The North Americans, very discouraged and depressed, decided to investigate the reason for the crushing defeat. \n\nA management team made up of senior management was formed to investigate and recommend appropriate action. Their conclusion was the Japanese had 8 people rowing and 1 person steering, while the North American team had 8 people steering and 1 person rowing. So, North American management hired a consulting company and paid them a large amount of money for a second opinion. \n\nThey advised that too many people were steering the boat, while not enough people were rowing. \n\nTo prevent another loss to the Japanese, the rowing team\u2019s management structure was totally reorganized to 4 steering supervisors, 3 area steering superintendents and 1 assistant superintendent steering manager. They also implemented a new performance system that would give the 1 person rowing the boat greater incentive to work harder. \n\nIt was called the\"Rowing Team Quality First Program\u201c, with meetings, dinners and free pens for the rower. There was discussion of getting new paddles, canoes and other equipment, extra vacation days for practices, and bonuses. \n\nThe next year the Japanese won by two miles. Humiliated, the North American management laid off the rower for poor performance, halted development of a new canoe, sold the paddles, and canceled all capital investments in new equipment. The money saved was distributed to the Senior Executives as bonuses and the next year\u2019s racing team was outsourced to India.",

Really only had two defining characteristics about her though, her love of lemon-lime sodas and her innate marksmanship. She was a damn good crackshot. Her dad was a bit of a gun nut. Owned lots of rifles including a classic, old-time sniper from back in the WWII era. Beautiful old thing. She learned to fire it at age 12, could hit targets at 100 meters by age 15. She ended up entering some sharpshooting competition around the area. This one competition was particularly important to her because it was sponsored by a soda company. The prize was a year\u2019s supply of any soda the winner wanted. Of course, my friend entered for that delicious lemon-lime goodness. So she hefted her trusty old sniper over to the field. There were 16 contestants so the competition was a single-elimination bracket. The rules were simple. Stand behind the line, aim and fire. If you hit it, the target got pushed back a few meters. If you miss and the other guy hits it, you\u2019re out. Well my friend easily blew most of the competitors out of the water. Punks couldn\u2019t hit the broad side of a barn. She completely cleared out her side of the bracket with almost no competition. It came down to the final round. She was up against Jackson. At 6 foot 6, this guy was an intimidating foe. Even with those catcher\u2019s glove-sized hands he still wielded his rifle with the grace of a ballerina. Completely wiped out his side of the bracket. It was getting tense. He fired off first. 50 meters. Easy. Her next. 50 meters. Easy. And then him. 100 meters. Easy. Her. 100 meters. Easy. 150. Harder. 200. Harder. 300. Barely made it. But it came down to the wire. Two bottles, 400 meters down the field. Jackson stepped up first, sweat dripping down his face. He fired. BANG. CRACK. The bullet nicked the side, shattering the target. But you could see the Jackson\u2019s nervousness. It was clear that he would not be able to hit the next target. It was up to Sierra now. She was sweating buckets. It all came down to this. If she could tap that glass even slightly, she\u2019d be looking at a year\u2019s supply of her favorite soft drink. She lined up her shot. Stared down the sights. The audience looked on in anticipation. Her lemon-lime drinks were on the line. This was all she needed. BANG. . . . Nothing. Her soda was gone. Sierra missed.",

        "body": "It was Caesar's birthday, and as in every year around this time, the Consuls were worrying about what to get him as a present. Brutus in particular was in a bind. How about a villa in the Apennines? He already had six. A Quinquireme? Marcus Antonius bought him a fleet of those last year, the suckup. He went to his wife for advice.\n\n \"O Portia, cousin and wife, avail me of your wisdom. What can I procure for our Dictator that will secure his good will and adequately celebrate the anniversary of his birth?\"\n\n Portia considered this for a moment, idly toying with a freshly greased ringlet. \"We just got the new Far Samarkand Silk Road Mail Order Catalog. Why don't you go sit in your, uh, thinking room and have a look? Even if there's nothing in there, it might inspire you.\" So, Brutus did just that. He settled onto the finely carved marble and hefted the Far Samarkand Silk Road Mail Order Catalog onto his lap, and began to page through.\n\n At first, he was dismayed at page after page of Apennine villas and fleets of Quinquiremes. He skipped over the heavily illustrated lingerie section, idly turning down the corners on a couple of pages for later reference - and then he saw it.\n\n Chocolate-Covered Christians.\n\n \"Each individually-crafted, guaranteed unique Chocolate-Covered Christian is shipped to you direct, on ice, and escorted by a platoon of Khwarezmian Eunuch Warrior Monks. Packed in straw and wicker and cradled in a specially-engineered howdah, the Chocolate-Covered Christian is carried by a camel trained from birth for this task*.\n\n \"*Ice, Warrior Monks, Packaging and Camel costs vary by shipping destination. Quantities are strictly limited, order now!\"\n\n He was dumbstruck. This was... perfect. A glance at the fine print confirmed his suspicion, he had just enough time to order a couple of these bad boys before the big celebration, Two would be a fitting gift for Caesar, what the heck, he thought.\n\n So, in due course, Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger went to the Appian Gate to take delivery. Sure enough, from far off in the distance he could see the dust cloud raised by his approaching delivery. As they drew closer, he could make out bright silk banners fluttering and the sound of Cornu and Auskales accompanying the strangely high-pitched singing of the escort. As they drew even closer, he could see the man-shaped wicker caskets standing atop the exotic beasts, swaying slightly back and forth, and steaming as the icy packaging sublimed in the midday sun.\n\n \"Awesome,\" thought Brutus, \"I am sorted. I'll pack these away in my icehouse until the big day. And the other crap beats any fancy wrapping paper.\"\n\n So, a few days passed. But, as Brutus went about his daily consular duties, some of his colleagues might have noticed that his mind was not on his task. He seemed somehow... distant. Only Brutus knew the truth, as he was constantly wondering... what do they taste like? As time went on, he was seized by doubt, what if they're just plain bad? I really need to check. \n\n So, came the night, and Brutus stole away into his icehouse. The Chocolate-Covered Christians stood in the darkness like a pair of mute witnesses to his shame, as he reached out... and snapped off a pinky finger. Breathlessly, he raised it to his lips, and bit.\n\n *It was delicious.*\n\n He could not control himself. This was the most delicious thing he had ever eaten. He reached out again, and snapped off the whole hand at the wrist. He devoured it in seconds, and reached out for more. \n\n By dawn, Brutus sat in shame, head in hands. Next to him, one of the Chocolate-Covered Christians was half gone, just a pair of legs standing like accusing sentinels. His head cleared slightly as he realized that there was still, mercifully, one entirely untouched Chocolate-Covered Christian to serve as his gift. Also, he still had both camels, much of the ice, and nearly all of the Eunuchs... Things weren't too bad. He breathed a sigh of genuine relief, and smiled inwardly in the knowledge that still, Caesar would never have received such a gift as this.\n\n So, the day of Caesar's celebration arrived. This year, the Consuls had pretty much outdone themselves - Publius had flooded the Plain of Mars and staged a naval battle. Crassus had given a fleet of Septiremes, with the extra two rows of oars manned by slaves selected for their resemblance to Marcus Antonius. Marcus Antonius himself had presented a bevy of a thousand barely-clad maidens, one from each distant province and kingdom of the known world. And now it was Brutus' turn. He mounted the steps of the Theater of Pompey to stand next to his Dictator and, he hoped, friend.\n\n \"Now, Caesar, let me present... Your Chocolate-Covered Christian.\". He raised an arm, and into the plaza moved the procession. The banners, trumpets, bells, drums and song were every bit as exotic as he had hoped. The panoply of the Eunuch Warriors and the camels were almost terrifying in their strangeness. And in the center, the swaying, faintly sinister Chocolate-Covered Christian itself, steaming slightly as the humid air chilled in its ice-cooled proximity. With pride, Brutus turned back to Caesar...\n\n ...In time to see Gaius Servilius Casca, standing behind Caesar, his arms raised, clutching a vicious looking knife in his hand. Brutus opened his mouth to cry out, but his shock was such that he was paralyzed into inaction. He was unable to stop the blow, and unable to act as others en the crowded steps moved forward, revealing formerly concealed knives, and rained down blows on Caesar.\n\n As they moved away to reveal the bloody figure on the ground, Brutus finally moved. He ran forwards and cradled the gory head of his dying friend. Still in shock, he leaned closer as he saw that Caesar was trying to speak. In his dying croak, he heard:\n\n \"Et tu, Brute?\"\n\n Brutus said, \"No! I only had half of one!\"",

The country hospital they found him in was trying to keep him from going blind by dropping eyedrops into his eyes every few minutes.  The missionaries felt horrible for the kid and his family, so they offered to adopt him, and after pulling a few strings they brought him to a children's hospital in Boston to see if he could be helped.\n\nSo this awesome plastic surgeon there discovered that he could transplant the kids foreskin and create useable eyelids, and they saved the kids sight!\n\nEverything worked, the surgery was successful.

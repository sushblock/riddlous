His mom said, \"A penis and vagina are terms for scarf and coat.\"\n\nAfter this, Timmy went upstairs to see what his father was doing. His dad was shaving. Suddenly his dad cut himself and yelled, \"SHIT!\"\nTimmy asked, \"What is shit?\"\nHis dad said, \" Shit is a type of shaving cream. Now go downstairs.\"\n\nTimmy went downstairs and into the kitchen. His mom was carving the turkey. His mom cut herself and shouted, \"Fuck!\"\nTimmy asked, \"What is fuck mom?\"\nHis mom said, \"Fuck is a way to carve a turkey.\"\n\nAll of a sudden the doorbell rang announcing the arrival of the guests. Timmy went to answer the door.\n\nHe opened the door and said, \" Hello bitches and bastards, let me take you penises and vaginas, my dad is upstairs wiping the shit off his face, and my mom is in the kitchen fucking the turkey.\"",

Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down. We need it up, you need it down. You don't hear us bitching about you leaving it down.\n1. Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we can find the perfect present yet again!\n1. Sometimes we are not thinking about you. Live with it.\n1. Saturday = sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.\n1. Don't cut your hair. Ever. Long hair is always more attractive than short hair. One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is that married women always cut their hair, and by then you're stuck with her.\n1. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way.\n1. Crying is blackmail.\n1. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!\n1. We don't remember dates. Mark birthdays and anniversaries on a calendar. Remind us frequently beforehand.\n1. Most guys own three pairs of shoes - tops. What makes you think we'd be any good at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your dress?\n1. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.\n1. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.\n1. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.\n1. Check your oil! Please.\n1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.\n1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us. We refuse to answer.\n1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.\n1. Let us ogle. We are going to look anyway; it's genetic.\n1. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.\n1. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.\n1. Christopher Columbus did not need directions, and neither do we.\n1. The relationship is never going to be like it was the first two months we were going out. Get over it. And quit whining to your girlfriends.\n1. ALL men see in only 16 colours, like Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a colour. We have no idea what mauve is.\n1. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.\n1. We are not mind readers and we never will be. Our lack of mind-reading ability is not proof of how little we care about you.\n1. If we ask what is wrong and you say \"nothing,\" we will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle.\n1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear.\n1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine. Really.\n1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as navel lint, the offside rule, or monster trucks.\n1. You have enough clothes.\n1. You have too many shoes.\n1. No NO you really do have too many shoes.\n1. It is neither in your best interest or ours to take the quiz together.\nNo, it doesn't matter which quiz.\n1. BEER is as exciting for us as handbags are for you.\n1. I'm in shape. ROUND is a shape.\n1. Thank you for reading this; Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight, but did you know we really don't mind that? It's like camping.",

I'm a bit of an entrepreneur, and recently moved down to Mexico after purchasing a chain of 5 convenience stores (TAB, if you ever wanna look us up. I promise we're good) up near the Texas border, all pretty much aligned on this one stretch of almost entirely empty road near the suburbs, miles from any other shop, and the only place the factory workers will go. My drive from our home takes me round a blind corner onto this stretch, and (I'll admit it), I do sometimes rev the engine a little and speed onto it when I'm late (it's so empty i may as well be speeding on the moon). Anyway, when I moved down here, i bought myself a car. Beautiful, antique, Citro\u00ebn DS safari (look them up and buy one, for the love of god). So our customers are primarily workers from the local factories, and after some bad experiences with the last store owners, they were eager to come to our opening weekend and greet us. Without thinking about this, i invest, i advertise, and i talk to people about how these shops are gonna aid the community. I employ locals, and by opening day, anticipation is roaring. I'd lived there for a couple of months while getting the shops ready, and I know the area well, so i know how much excitement there is. Our original plan was to open one store at a time, so we could gauge people's interest, but on the morning of opening, I (tired and already late for grand opening. Whoops) decided to tell the guys to open all the stores at once. Big mistake. As i zoom round the blind (usually deserted) corner, i see a line of cars, all waiting to park in our bays. Word must have gotten around from the employees to the people, and EVERYONE was here to try all the stores. As i say, i was late, and speeding, so i had no time to think, and swerved right into our first store, attempting to avoid the cars of enthusiastic locals. It was hell. My beautiful Citro\u00ebn DS safari was practically in half, my store was ruined, and all because i misjudged how popular my business already was. ANYWAY, TL;DR, I had too many tabs open and safari crashed\n",

So we have one more offer for you before we leave: for an additional $50 million each, we ask you two to swap couples with us for one night so we may experience human sex.\"\n\n\"$100 million more?! Yeah, we'll do it!\" exclaim the human couple.

Still, the gentleman was too shy to speak to the Pontiff.\nShortly after take-off, the Pope began a crossword puzzle. This is fantastic, thought the gentleman I'm really good at crosswords. Perhaps, if the Pope gets stuck, he'll ask me for assistance.\nAlmost immediately, the Pope turned to the gentleman and said, \"Excuse me, but do you know a four letter word referring to a woman that ends in 'u-n-t'?\"\nOnly one word leapt to mind...my goodness, thought the gentleman, I can't tell the Pope that. There must be another. The gentleman thought for quite a while, then it hit him. Turning to the pope, the gentleman said, \"I think you're looking for the word 'aunt'.\"\n\"Of course,\" said the Pope. \"Do you have an eraser?\"",

It would make you uncomfortable.\"\n\nBut, the girl insists, until finally the guy gives in and tells her what the trick is. \"My frog, he, well, he eats pussy.\"\n\nThe girl is shocked, but also somewhat excited, so she asks, \"Can I try it?\"\n\nThe guy says, \"Okay, sure. I've got a few hours to kill. I have a hotel room across the street, here's the key, just take him over there and let him do his thing.\"\n\nSo the girl takes the frog and heads over to the hotel. After a little while, the phone at the bar rings, and the bartender hands it to the guy. The girl is on the other end. \n\n\"Hey, so, I'm sitting up here, spread-eagled, naked on the bed, and the frog is just staring at me, not doing anything. What gives?\"\n\nThe guy lets out a sigh and says, \"Okay, hang on,  I know what to do. I'll be right over.\" And sure enough, there was the girl, naked on the bed, the frog just staring at her. So the guy walks up to the frog, shakes his fist at it and says,\n\n\"I'm only gonna show you how to do this *one more time*!\"",

The decedent had jumped from the top of a ten- story building intending to commit suicide (he left a note indicating his despondency). As he fell past the ninth floor, his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast through a window, which killed him instantly. Neither the shooter nor the decedent was aware that a safety net had been erected at the eighth floor level to protect some window washers and that Opus would not have been able to complete his suicide anyway because of this.\" \n\n\"Ordinarily,\" Dr. Mills continued, \"a person who sets out to commit suicide ultimately succeeds, even though the mechanism might not be what he intended. That Opus was shot on the way to certain death nine stories below probably would not have changed his mode of death from suicide to homicide. But the fact that his suicidal intent would not have been successful caused the medical examiner to feel that he had homicide on his hands. \"The room on the ninth floor whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife. They were arguing and he was threatening her with the shotgun. He was so upset that, when he pulled the trigger, he completely missed his wife and the pellets went through the a window striking Opus.\n\n\"When one intends to kill subject A but kills subject B in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B. When confronted with this charge, the old man and his wife were both adamant that neither knew that the shotgun was loaded. The old man said it was his long-standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun. He had no intention to murder her - therefore, the killing of Opus appeared to be an accident. That is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.\n\n\"The continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's son loading the shotgun approximately six weeks prior to the fatal incident. It transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial support and the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother. The case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of Ronald Opus.\n\nThere was an exquisite twist. \"Further investigation revealed that the son [Ronald Opus] had become increasingly despondent over the failure of his attempt to engineer his mother's murder. This led him to jump off the ten-story building on March 23, only to be killed by a shotgun blast through a ninth story window.\n\n\"The medical examiner closed the case as a suicide.\" ",

I'm setting up a home office in the den, and I'm thinking of buying a computer. \n\nABBOT: Mac? \n\nCOSTELLO: No, the name is Bud. \n\nABBOT: Your computer? \n\nCOSTELLO: I don't own a computer. I want to buy one. \n\nABBOT: Mac? \n\nCOSTELLO: I told you, my name is Bud. \n\nABBOT: What about Windows? \n\nCOSTELLO: Why? Does it get stuffy? \n\nABBOT: Do you want a computer with Windows? \n\nCOSTELLO: I don't know. What do I see when I look out the windows? \n\nABBOT: Wallpaper. \n\nCOSTELLO: Never mind the windows. I need a computer and software. \n\nABBOT: Software that runs on Windows? \n\nCOSTELLO: No, on the computer! I need something I can use to write proposals, track expenses. You know, run a business. What have you got? \n\nABBOT: Office. \n\nCOSTELLO: Yeah, for my office. Can you recommend anything? \n\nABBOT: I just did. \n\nCOSTELLO: You just did what? \n\nABBOT: Recommended something. \n\nCOSTELLO: You recommended something? \n\nABBOT: Yes. \n\nCOSTELLO: For my office? \n\nABBOT: Yes. \n\nCOSTELLO: Okay, what did you recommend for my office? \n\nABBOT: Office. \n\nCOSTELLO: Yes, for my office. \n\nABBOT: Office for Windows. \n\nCOSTELLO: I already have an office and it already has windows! Let's say I'm sitting at my computer, and I want to type a proposal. What do I need? \n\nABBOT: Word. \n\nCOSTELLO: If I'm writing a proposal, I'm going to need lots of words. But what program do I load? \n\nABBOT: Word. \n\nCOSTELLO: What word? \n\nABBOT: The Word in Office. \n\nCOSTELLO: The only word in office is office. \n\nABBOT: The Word in Office for Windows. \n\nCOSTELLO: Which word in \"office for windows?\" \n\nABBOT: The Word you get when you click the blue W. \n\nCOSTELLO: I'm going to click your big W if you don't give me a straight answer. Let's forget about words for a minute. What do I need if I want to watch a movie over the Internet? \n\nABBOT: RealOne. \n\nCOSTELLO: Maybe a real movie, maybe a cartoon. What I watch is none of your business. But what do I need to watch it? \n\nABBOT: RealOne. \n\nCOSTELLO: If it's a long movie I'll also want to watch reels two, three and four. Can I watch reel four? \n\nABBOT: Of course. \n\nCOSTELLO: Great! With what? \n\nABBOT: RealOne. \n\nCOSTELLO: Okay, so I'm sitting at my computer and I want to watch a movie. What do I do? \n\nABBOT: You click the blue 1. \n\nCOSTELLO: I click the blue one what? \n\nABBOT: The blue 1. \n\nCOSTELLO: Is that different from the blue W? \n\nABBOT: Of course it is. The blue 1 is Real One. The blue W is Word. \n\nCOSTELLO: What word? \n\nABBOT: The Word in Office for Windows. \n\nCOSTELLO: But there's three words in \"office for windows!\" \n\nABBOT: No, just one. But it's the most popular Word in the world. \n\nCOSTELLO: It is? \n\nABBOT: Yes, although to be fair there aren't many other Words left. It pretty much wiped out all the other Words. \n\nCOSTELLO: And that word is the real one? \n\nABBOT: No. Real One has nothing to do with Word. Real One isn't even part of Office. \n\nCOSTELLO: Never mind; I don't want to get started with that again. But I also need something for bank accounts, loans, and so on. What do you have to help me track my money? \n\nABBOT: Money. \n\nCOSTELLO: That's right. What do you have? \n\nABBOT: Money. \n\nCOSTELLO: I need money to track my money? \n\nABBOT: No, not really. It comes bundled with your computer. \n\nCOSTELLO: What comes bundled with my computer? \n\nABBOT: Money. \n\nCOSTELLO: Money comes bundled with my computer? \n\nABBOT: Exactly. No extra charge. \n\nCOSTELLO: I get a bundle of money with my computer at no extra charge? How much money do I get? \n\nABBOT: Just one copy. \n\nCOSTELLO: I get a copy of money. Isn't that illegal? \n\nABBOT: No. We have a license from Microsoft to make copies of Money. \n\nCOSTELLO: Microsoft can license you to make money? \n\nABBOT: Why not? They own it. \n\nCOSTELLO: Well, it's great that I'm going to get free money, but I'll still need to track it. Do you have anything for managing your money? \n\nABBOT: Managing Your Money? That program disappeared years ago. \n\nCOSTELLO: Well, what do you sell in its place? \n\nABBOT: Money. \n\nCOSTELLO: You sell money? \n\nABBOT: Of course. But if you buy a computer from us, you get it for free. \n\nCOSTELLO: That's all very wonderful, but I'll be running a business. Do you have any software for, you know, accounting? \n\nABBOT: Simply Accounting. \n\nCOSTELLO: Probably, but it might get a little complicated. \n\nABBOT: If you don't want Simply Accounting, you might try M.Y.O.B. \n\nCOSTELLO: M.Y.O.B.? What does that stand for? \n\nABBOT: Mind Your Own Business. \n\nCOSTELLO: I beg your pardon? \n\nABBOT: No, that would be I.B.Y.P. I said M.Y.O.B. \n\nCOSTELLO: Look, I just need to do some accounting for my home business. You know--accounting? You do it with money. \n\nABBOT: Of course you can do accounting with Money. But you may need more. \n\nCOSTELLO: More money? \n\nABBOT: More than Money. Money can't do everything. \n\nCOSTELLO: I don't need a sermon! Okay, let's forget about money for the moment. I'm worried that my computer might... what's the word? Crash. And if my computer crashes, what can I use to restore my data? \n\nABBOT: Go Back. \n\nCOSTELLO: Okay. I'm worried about my computer smashing and I need something to restore my data. What do you recommend? \n\nABBOT: Go Back. \n\nCOSTELLO: How many times do I have to repeat myself? \n\nABBOT: I've never asked you to repeat yourself. All I said was Go Back. \n\nCOSTELLO: How can I go back if I haven't even been anywhere? Okay, I'll go back. What do I need to write a proposal? \n\nABBOT: Word. \n\nCOSTELLO: But I'll need lots of words to write a proposal. \n\nABBOT: No, you only need one Word-the Word in Office for Windows. \n\nCOSTELLO: But there's three words in ...

His parents indulged him, buying plush toys and teddy bears. \n\nHe never outgrew his fascination, and as a young man took a job as an assistant at a veterinary clinic so he could be around animals. In the meantime, he taught himself how to cut and sew furry costumes. He got quite good at this, making fantastically detailed versions of his favourite cartoon animals as well as his own creations.\n\nBut he was lonely in his obsession. He knew others wouldn\u2019t appreciate his efforts so he was reduced to wearing his beautiful creations alone in his small apartment in the back of the veterinary clinic. So imagine his elation one day when, playing around on the internet, he discovered Furries. Here was a whole subculture of like-minded people.\n\nHe began communicating with other Furries, joined organizations, signed up for the newsletter, he even got the T-shirt. Then he learned that a large Furry convention was to be held in his city. He pre-purchased his ticket and began to work furiously on a new costume. One that could win first prize at the convention.\n\nConvention weekend finally came and on the first day he had the time of his life. For the first time he was among people like himself, and everyone was in glorious costume. He even met a cute little vixen, and they talked for hours.\n\nThe next day he worked all day finishing his new costume. He wanted it to be perfect. The judging was to be that evening and he wanted to impress the little vixen and he wanted to win the contest.\n\nJust as he was finishing up he checked the time and saw that if he didn\u2019t hurry he would be late for the parade and judging. Just a few more stitches and he threw the costume on, (it was magnificent), ran out his apartment door and through the dark animal clinic. \n\nUnfortunately, in his haste, he hadn\u2019t made the eye holes just right and it was hard to see in the darkened clinic. He tripped and went tumbling head first into the bin where they kept the large syringes for the horse tranquilizers. \n\nHe got to his feet and turned on a light. The fur on his costume was thick enough that he hadn\u2019t been pricked by any of the needles but he did look like a hedgehog. He pulled all the syringes out and ran through the door and down the street all the way the hotel where the convention was. What he didn\u2019t know was that there was still one big syringe sticking right out of the top his head.\n\nHe was just in time and proudly paraded in front of the judges and winked at the little vixen he spotted in the crowd. Jeff didn\u2019t win first prize, but he did win in one of the more obscure categories. He looked at his medal and it said, \u201cFirst prize for the best depiction of a show tune.\u201d\n\nPuzzled, he asked the presenting judge, \u201cWhat show tune?\u201d \u201c*The Furry with the Syringe on Top*, of course.\u201d\n",

He gets this job and works his heart out. He works every night stacking shelves, earning money. He spends very little, and saves heaps. He is the best worker the supermarket has ever seen. A year passes, and the circus comes to town.\n\nAs soon as the gates to the circus open, Johnny races up, first in line to buy a ticket. The excitement overwhelms him. He walks around the circus. He sees the animals, the freak show, buys a hot dog, plays on the clowns. And then he sees it, what he's been waiting for all these years...The Big Top.\n\nJohnny races into the tent and takes a seat at the front. Pretty soon the tent fills up and the show begins. It's a packed house and the buzz is electric. The dancing horses come out, then the elephants, then everyone's favorite, the clowns. The clowns run around and do their act making everyone laugh. When all this is finished, the head clown picks up a microphone and says \"Now we'd like to pick a member of the audience to help with our show.\"\n\nAll the lights go out and a spotlight circles the crowd and, as luck should have it, it lands on Johnny. Johnny is ecstatic, he nearly wets his pants with excitement. He can't believe his luck. The head clown comes up to him and says..\n\n\"Hey mister, are you the horse's head?\"\n\n\"No.\" Johnny replies.\n\n\"Are you the horse's ear?\"\n\n\"No\"\n\n\"Are you the horse's tail?\"\n\n\"No\"\n\n\"Then you must be the horse's ASS!!!!\"\n\nAnd then whole tent erupts into fits of laughter all of Johnny's expense. Everyone is laughing, except for Johnny. He's annoyed as all hell. He vows then and there that next year, when the circus comes to town, he'll get his revenge on the clown.\n\nAs he's walking home, still fuming from the humiliation that the clown caused, Johnny thinks of ways that he can get back at the clown. Death, violence, poisoning....and then it hits him. Johnny will give the clown a taste of his own medicine. Next year, Johnny will blast the clown with the biggest insult ever!\n\nThe next morning Johnny flips through the phonebook looking for someone who can help him with his revenge. Then he finds an ad.\n\n**INSULT SCHOOL**\n\n*Sick of being picked on? Come to our school and soon you'll be verbally attacking people with vigor!*\n\n'This is just what I need!!!\" says Johnny. So he rings up the school and enrols the next day.\n\nSo every day Johnny goes to the insult school, studying hard so he can learn the best and most harsh insult so he can get back at the clown. He's studied witty retorts and comebacks so much that he becones an expert in the field and the school's top student.On top of this, he still stacks shelves at the supermarket to get the money for the circus. Day in, day out Johnny works his ass off.\n\nThen his day arrives...\n\nAs soon as the circus opens its gates Johnny barges to the front of the line, pushing people out of his way. No longer is he a kind, considerate man, he's a comeback master hellbent on revenge. He give the ticket seller the money, snatches the ticket and storms off.\n\nHe sees all the regular stuff. The animals, the freaks, the clowns. He's so excited that he goes into the Big Top an hour before the show starts, just so he can get a good seat. The tent begins to fill up and the show starts...\n\nThe dancing horses come out, Johnny yawns. Then the elephants, Johnny tries to stay awake. And then the act Johnny has waited a year for, the clowns. The clowns run around and do their act making everyone laugh. Johnny wonders why everyone is laughing, it's the same act they did last year. When all this is finished, the head clown picks up a microphone, exactly the same as last year, and says \"Now we'd like to pick a member of the audience to help with our show.\"\n\nAll the lights go out and a spotlight circles the crowd. and, as luck should have it again, it lands on Johnny. Johnny is sits cool, calm and collected. The head clown comes up to him and says..\n\n\"Hey mister, are you the horse's head?\"\n\n\"No.\" Johnny replies.\n\n\"Are you the horse's ear?\"\n\n\"No\"\n\n\"Are you the horse's tail?\"\n\n\"No\"\n\n\"Then you must be the horse's ASS!!!!\"\n\nAnd again the whole tent erupts with laughter. Except for Johnny. He sits there staring straight at the clown, a look of pure evil and hate on his face. The laughter quickly dies down as everyone knows something is going to happen. The crowd watched.\n\nThis is Johnny's moment.\n\nHe takes a deep breath, calmly grabs the the microphone, looks the clown dead in the eyes and says...\n\n\"FUCK YOU, CLOWN!\"",

Very quietly he whispered \"477\".\n\nHardly a murmur.\n\nHe looked at his tutor. \"What's wrong?\" he said. \"Try again,\" says the tutor.\n\nSo he does. \"318\" - same again, not a thing, hardly a murmur.\n\n\"Something's wrong,\" he says.\n\n\"Well,\" says the tutor, \"it's not so much the joke as the way you tell it!\"\n\nThis student eventually succeeded by accident in the most dramatic and unexpected way.

His mind was swimming with doubt and elation. He never had a good relationship with his own father, and it was of great importance to him that he not repeat his father's sins. As the day wore on, his doubts began to fade into unbridled anticipation. He passed cigars around the break room, and happily accepted congratulations from his coworkers. Everyone's positivity only amplified John's joy.\n\nFinally the call came, and John rushed from the factory, stopping only in the hospital gift shop for a huge bouquet of flowers and a Teddy bear for his new pride and joy.\n\nWhen he arrived at the delivery room, the doctor informed him that minor complications had forced them to do a C-section. John had to wait outside the OR.\n\nThough it wasn't long,, the wait seemed INFINITE to the impatient new father. He paced up and down the busy hallway, his mind racing, thinking back to all the ways HIS father failed, and swearing to himself that his son would never have to experience that pain. He began to sweat profusely, and opened a hallway window for some fresh air.\n\n\"I'll never touch another drop of alcohol!\" he thought. \"And I'll do with him everything I never got to do. I'll teach him baseball! I'll teach him about girls!\" With every thought and future plan, his heart swelled with love and emotion.   \n\nFinally the doctor emerged from the operating room, gently carrying a tiny figure wrapped tightly in hospital blankets.\n\n\"Here's your boy!\" \n\nJohn began to cry happy tears. \"Oh my God, doc! Can I hold him? Please let me hold him!\"\n\n\"Of course!\" said the doctor...but as the doctor approached John, he stumbled and the baby slipped from his arms and hit the floor with a sickening \"thunk\".\n\nJohn's scream could be heard two counties away.\n\n\"Oh my God, I'm so sorry!\" said the doctor, and he lunged to scoop the newborn off the floor...but when he bent over, he lost his balance and pitched forward with the child in his arms.\n\n\"WhooooOOAAAH!\" The doctor stumbled across the hall and slammed into the wall...and the baby flew from his arms again....and out the open window, plummeting 5 stories down to the parking lot.\n\nJohn hit his knees with a sobbing banshee wail. \"What have you done!?!?

Because of the delicate nature of this procedure, replacement of mouse balls should only be attempted by properly trained personnel. Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining the underside of the mouse. Domestic balls will be larger and harder than foreign balls. \n\nBall removal procedures differ depending upon the manufacturer of the mouse. Foreign balls can be replaced using the pop off method. Domestic balls are replaced by using the twist-off method. \n\nMouse balls are not usually static sensitive. However, excessive handling can result in sudden discharge. \n\nUpon completion of ball replacement, the mouse may be used immediately. It is recommended that each replacer have a pair of spare balls for maintaining optimum customer satisfaction. Any customer missing his balls should suspect local personnel of removing these necessary items.",

She even managed to win the game but, unfortunately, time had run out before the show\u2019s host could ask her the big question. Needless to say, Jane agreed to return the following day. Jane was nervous and fidgety as her husband drove them home. \u201cI\u2019ve just gotta win tomorrow. I wish I knew what the answers were. You know I\u2019m not going to sleep at all tonight. I will probably look like garbage tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cRelax, honey,\u201d her husband, Roger, reassured her. \u201cIt will all be OK.\u201d Ten minutes after they arrived home, Roger grabbed the car keys and started heading out the door.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Jane asked.\n\n\u201cI have a little errand to run. I should be back soon\u201d he replied. Jane waited impatiently for Roger\u2019s return. After an agonizing 3 hour absence, Roger returned, sporting a very wide and wicked grin. \u201cHoney, I managed to get tomorrow\u2019s question and answer!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she cried excitedly.\n\n\u201cOK. The question is: \u2018What are the three main parts of the male anatomy?\u2019 And the answer is \u2018The head, the heart, and the penis.\u2019 \u201d Shortly after that, the couple went to sleep with Jane, now feeling confident and at ease, plummeting into a deep and restful slumber. At 3:30 in the morning, however, Jane was shaken awake by Roger, who was asking her the quiz show question.\n\n\u201cThe head, the heart, and the penis,\u201d Jane replied groggily before returning to sleep. And Roger asked her again in the morning, this time as Jane was brushing her teeth. Once again, Jane replied correctly.\n\nSo it was that Jane was once again on the set of the quiz show. Even though she knew the question and answer, she could feel the butterflies conquering her stomach and nervousness running through her veins. The cameras began running and the host, after reminding the audience of the previous days events, faced Jane and asked the big question.\n\n\u201cJane, for $65,000, what are the main parts of the male anatomy? You have 10 seconds.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm, uhm, the head?\u201d she said nervously. \u201cVery good. Six seconds.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh, uh, the heart?\u201d \u201cVery good! Four seconds.\u201d\n\n\u201cI, uhh, ooooooohh, darn!

He's bored with running around in circles, beating up crazy old men in their flying machines, and collecting gold that he loses all too soon.

He explains that they are a peaceful, quiet group that promotes detachment from wealth. Sonic, of course, is intrigued, and he goes home to consider his proposition. For many days, Sonic sits at home, silently pondering. And in his meditation, he realizes more and more how much he enjoys it. He gathers all his friends together to tell them of his decision. Knuckles believes it's a great idea. Miles, though supportive, has trouble coming to terms with it. Amy is livid. After all the years they spent together, and now he wants to just up and leave! Sonic has made his decision, however, and he's sticking to it. He goes to the Buddhist temple and becomes a monk. He spends every day sitting and meditating, and he even learns to tend the zen garden and to cook for the monastery. Every day is peaceful and wonderful for him. After a few months, Amy comes by to visit. She begins to see how much he's enjoying life, how fulfilled he is. She realizes how foolish she was to try to keep him from this. Sonic thanks her for understanding, and they hold each other in a warm embrace. Amy asks him if he'd like to eat together that evening. Sonic, his face fallen, says, \"Gotta go fast.\"",

The guy thinks to himself \"Since I am up here, I must be in.\" He is ready to walk in, when St. Peter stops him and explains the new rule. The guy goes \"Okay, but how will you know if I had a bad death or not?\"\n\nSt. Peter thinks for a minute and says, \"Well just tell me how you died and I will decide.\"\n\nThe guy begins, \"I was planning to go to a party after work, but since I was exhausted I did not go, but instead came home. As I was walking into my condo, which is on the 4th floor by the way. I saw shoes at my door that did not belong, so I barge into my apartment and surely enough I find my wife half naked. I search the whole apartment up and down and don't find anyone. All of a sudden, I hear a guy screaming for help from my balcony. So I go out there and see a guy hanging for his life from my balcony. I start stomping on his fingers and make sure he lets go of the balcony and falls down. The bastard falls into the bushes and I look down but still see him twitching. So I decide to grab my refrigerator and throw it down the balcony to make sure the son of a bitch dies. But after doing all that hard work I had an heart attack. Now I am up here.\"\n\nSt. Peter thinks for a second and says \"Well you're wife cheated on you right before you died that seems like a pretty bad way to die. What the hell, go on ahead in buddy.\"\n\nA few seconds pass and another guy comes to the gates. St. Peter gives him the whole talk and tells him to tell him his story. \n\nThe guy begins, \"I live on the 5th floor of a condo and I was on my balcony practicing yoga when all of a sudden I lost my balance and fell. Luckily, I caught the 4th floor's balcony. I am hanging there for my dear life and screaming for help. Out of nowhere, this guy comes out swearing and starts stomping on my fingers for no reason. I obviously lose my grip and fall down. I fell into some bushes and survived. I was struggling to get up and when I opened my eyes I see a refrigerator come at me. Now I am up here.\"\n\nSt. Peter decides \"That's a pretty bad death, go on in buddy.\"\n\nA few seconds later another guy comes up and St. Peter gives him the talk and tells him to tell his story.\n\nThe guy begins, \"I was minding my own business naked in a refrigerator...\"",

He draws his rifle, takes careful measure in aiming his rifle, and fires his rifle. From what he perceived as the bear being hit, Peter makes his way toward where he spotted the animal. Upon arrival, Peter is shocked that the bear had disappeared. The bear reveals himself from behind, placing his big, warm paw on Peter's shoulder. The bear proceeds to maul Peter to the ground and rape him in a vicious fashion. Peter was able to escape during the act, runs away as fast as he can to safety, and finds refuge as he locks himself into his cabin.\n\nPeter spent all night feeling violated, as he addressed his wounds from the altercation. Nonetheless, Peter comes to a resolve and proceeds to plan for the next day, with a strong determination for the kill. \n\nPeter returns to the area where he spotted the bear with a more powerful, accurate weapon. He hides in the bushes for hours to what seemed as no avail until the bear arrives in plain sight, approximately 200 yards away. Peter points his rifle, takes a more careful measure in aiming his rifle, and fires. With what seemed as absolute certainty, Peter makes his way toward where the bear was shot. Upon arrival, Peter is shocked that the bear had disappeared once again. \n\nThe bear reveals himself from behind with his big, warm paw on Peter's shoulder. With a cunning grin, the bear pins the hunter to the ground once again and, in a savage, bloody fashion, rapes Peter. Unable to escape, Peter endured a gruesome rape which seemed to last a lifetime. When the bear was finished, Peter was able to escape. Crying for dear life, Peter runs to his cabin once again. \n\nPeter had a very hard time coping with the event that had just occurred as he curled himself in a fetal position in the corner of the bathtub, where he sat in a cold shower for hours until he could come to his senses. Nonetheless, Peter addressed his wounds and eventually came to his senses.\n\nPeter spends an off-day from the hunt to go to the store, where he invests in a very powerful, very accurate weapon. The hunter returns to the wilderness the following morning with the determination for the kill. He spends several hours in hiding, camouflaged within the bushes until the bear finally appears approximately 200 yards away. Peter positions his weapon, locks the bear within the crosshairs of the scope, takes a deep breath and fires. The bear hits the ground.\n\nWith adrenaline rushing through his veins, Peter jumps out of the bushes and sprints to the area where the bear was shot. Upon arrival, Peter's excitement quickly turned into fright as he discovers that the bear disappeared once again. The bear reveals himself once more, with a big, warm paw over the hunter's shoulder.

The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.\n\nHowever, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared  on the bird's beaks and claws. By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while  only 2% \nwere killed by an impact with a car.\n\nMTA then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car  kills. He very quickly concluded the cause:  When crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger.\n\nThey discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout \"Cah\", not a single crow could shout \"Truck.\"",

Sex keeps me awake at night.'\nThe clerk said, 'Me, too.'\"\n\n\"When my wife and I separated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog.

The teacher, knowing that Little Johnny has been known to use dirty language, decides to call on Susie instead. \"Apple!\" Susie exclaims. The teacher nods in approval and asks if anyone knows a word that starts with 'B'. Again, Little Johnny's hand shoots up. The teacher sees this but calls on Billy. \"Baseball.\" he says as the teacher nods with approval. It goes on like this for a little while longer until she gets to the letter 'R'. By this time, Little Johnny figures that he isn't going to get called on again and lazily puts his hand up. The teacher sees this and thinks to herself, \"I cant think of a bad word that starts with 'R'. I think it'll be safe to call on Little Johnny now\".

The Chief looks at him, then looks at the student's relatively new Mazda, and sighs. This isn't the first time he has dealt with white men intruding on the tribe.\n\nA very nervous Walter walks past the rapidly-increasing queue of tribe members that had gathered to \"welcome\" him. With only 3 cracks in his voice he said to the Chief: \n\n\"H-h-hello, Mr. Chief.\"\n-Silence-\n\"I would like to tell your story to the world. The story of your people!\"\n\"Bah\", the Chief says, \"Only members of the tribe are aloud to record us here. It cannot be done.\"\n\nWalter, fearing a F on his final Cinematography project, has to think quickly.\n\n\"Please Chief, I mean no disrespect. I am simply fascinated by your culture. I would do anything to gain your trust, and any shots you don't like I will take out of the film.\"\n\nThe Chief ponders this for a moment. The kid is persistent, he hasn't moved an inch since he asked permission to film. The Chief can see beads of sweat growing under Walter's brow. \n\n*\"I've got it\"*, thinks the Chief.\n\n\"Okay boy, if you can survive the trials every boy in the tribe must conquer to become a man, I'll make you an honorary tribe-member and let you film. \nFirst, you must drink my son, the future Chief, under the table. Then, assuming you are conscious, you must trek alone through the sacred woods in nothing but a loincloth  and wrestle the mother bear known to wander the caves. After that, you must return here and make love to one of our Native women.\"\n\n*Walter is **ecstatic**.* Ready for anything, he says : \"Okay. Let's start now.\"\n-----------\nThe Chief's son and Walter sit down in the drinking teepee. There is an eerie silence in the air. \nChief sets two tall shot glasses in front of the young men and filled the glasses with Triple Sec. The Chief's son drank his first, throwing it to the back of his throat with the efficiency of a seasoned alcoholic. Right after, Walter takes his shot and almost chokes. Refusing to let this opportunity slip through his fingers, Walter sets his glass back down on the wooden table and slides it towards the Chief, who gladly filled it again - this time with Rum. Next it was Gin, then Whiskey, and much later the Chief pulled out his bottle of home-brewed moonshine and cracked the top. \n\nThe Chief's son is slamming drinks back like nobody's business. He doesn't even flinch when the liquor burns the back of his throat. He retains a calm demeanor and silently puts them away. Just as Walter thinks he can't take another shot, the Chief pours the two of them another round of Moonshine. The Chief's son takes his glass in his hand, pours it down his esophagus. \n\nThen he falls out of his chair onto the floor with a **thump**.\n\nWith a shout Walter jumps out of his seat and begins to strip down. He puts on his loincloth and sprints out into the wilderness. \n-------\nThe Chief does not see nor hear from him for days. Just as he is calling off the search for Walter, they hear a strange rustling from the bushes on the edge of the forest. \n\nWalter emerges, covered in cuts and bruises. His hair is twiggy and ragged, his nails are dirty, and he's missing his loincloth! He staggers up to the Chief and through labored breath says:\n\"So where's this chick you want me to beat up?\"",

        "body": "**It's about 10,000 words long. So get comfy.**\n\nSo, there's a man crawling through the desert.\n \nHe'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.\n \nHe stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.\n \nHe thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So, he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the direction he thinks is right.\n \nHe walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.\n \nHe pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.\n \nBy the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.\n \nAs it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things, he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.\n \nFull dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.\n \nHe wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.\n \nHe knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.\n \nHe rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.\n \nThen he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.\n \nLooking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.\n \nAs he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.\n \nHe decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle. He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to make some difference and keep himself from passing out.\n \nHe's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him, it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.\n \nHe walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills, dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water. Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.\n \nAfter a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.\n \nAfter more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it, trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.\n \nHe was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.\n \nHe walks through the sand.\n \nAfter a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.\n \nBut, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.\n \nHalfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.\n \nWhile crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape - shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.\n \nHe finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top, he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.\n \nAgain, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from here. He's going to have to go down there and look.\n \nHe puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune. After a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.\n \nHe stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.\n \nSo, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last chance.\n \nHe gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just keeps crawling.\n \nFinally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center, where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone area.\n \nHis mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun overhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying down on the nice cool surface.\n \nCool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him a drink. Then he'll know he's gone.\n \nHe decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the center before he goes. He keeps crawling.\n \nIt's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's hearing. He would swear that someone just said, \"Greetings, traveler. You do not look well. Do you hear me?\"\n \nHe stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and knees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something different - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands and tries again. Better this time.\n \nYep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet out of the stone, at an angle.\n \nAnd wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.\n \nHe stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to move from this spot.\n \nWell, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.\n \nHmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet - that was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.\n \nHe then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here because he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was likely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was now on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake was even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.\n \nHe tries to clear his throat to say, \"Hello,\" but his throat is too dry. All that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out, almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't good. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes out.\n \nHe gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips, and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk now.\n \nHe tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to spot the owner of this place, and croaks out, \"Hello? Is there anyone here?\"\n \nHe hears, from his side, \"Greetings. What is it that you want?\"\n \nHe turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides to try asking for help.\n \n\"Please,\" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, \"I'd love to not be thirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?\"\n \nLooking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its mouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he falls forward, face first on the stone, \"Very well. Coming up.\"\n \nA piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped around the tilted white post, still looking at him.\n \nHe reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet. He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes - they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been bitten. By the snake.\n \n\"It'll feel better in a minute.\" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more importantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!\n \n\"Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the afterlife?\"\n \n\"Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,\" says the snake. \"That's the way I work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.\"\n \n\"You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be thirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk? Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?\"\n \n\"No,\" says the snake, \"I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just sitting around here.\"\n \nThe man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer dying of thirst.\n \n\"I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your system with the next request,\" continued the snake. \"I can guess why you drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or two, if you drank enough of it.\"\n \n\"Ummm, n-next request?\" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.\n \n\"That's the way it works. If you like, that is,\" explained the snake. \"You get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish.\" The snake grinned at his own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.\n \n\"But there are rules,\" the snake continued. \"The first request is free. The second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of responsibility.\" The snake looks at the man seriously.\n \n\"By the way,\" the snake says suddenly, \"my name is Nathan. Old Nathan, Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound used to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into names. You can call me Nate, if you wish.\" Again, the snake grinned. \"Sorry if I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds somewhat threatening.\" The snake give his rattle a little shake.\n \n\"Umm, my name is Jack,\" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. \"Jack Samson.\n \n\"Can I ask you a question?\" Jack says suddenly. \"What happened to the poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that? What do you mean by that's how you work?\"\n \n\"That's more than one question,\" grins Nate. \"But I'll still try to answer all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question.\" The snake's grin gets wider. \"Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need to drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not be thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert. You've been changed.\n \n\"For the third question,\" Nate continues, \"you are still dying. Besides the effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal. In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years. Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is.\" Nate seemed vastly amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.\n \n\"As for the fourth question,\" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, \"first you have to agree to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell you.\"\n \n\"Wait,\" joked Jack, \"isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd have to kill me?\"\n \n\"I thought that was implied.\" Nate continued to look serious.\n \n\"Ummm...yeah.\" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was talking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a nasty temper. \"So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really stop the effects of the methanol?\" Jack thought for a second. \"And, what do you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper fluid, and just denature it?\"\n \n\"They may, I don't really know,\" said Nate. \"I haven't gotten out in a while. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and on that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you pulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume that they still color wiper fluid blue?\"\n \n\"Yeah, they do,\" said Jack.\n \n\"I figured,\" replied Nate. \"As for being bound by secrecy - with the fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me, this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me, write about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will lead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding anyway, so you won't notice.\" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.\n \nJack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a little nervous at this. \"Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?\"\n \nWell, Jack,\" said Nate sadly, \"I can't tell you that, unless you make the second request.\" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.\n \n\"Umm, well, ok,\" said Jack, \"what is this about a second request? What can I ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?\"\n \n\"Sure!\" said Nate, brightening. \"You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes to yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and before you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or omnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous and yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and sort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be omniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very useful, at least in my opinion.\" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was staring at him.\n \n\"Well, anyway,\" continued Nate, \"I'd probably suggest giving you permanent good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long time, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to recover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a request to me.\"\n \n\"Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?\" said Jack. \"And keep me healthy for a long time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request about a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not really a change to me?\"\n \n\"Right,\" nodded Nate.\n \n\"Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?\" Jack asked, hopefully.\n \n\"That takes two requests, Jack.\"\n \n\"Yeah, I figured so,\" said Jack. \"But I could ask to be a genius? I could become the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?\"\n \n\"Well, I could make you very smart,\" admitted Nate, \"but that wouldn't necessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you very athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either. You've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some truth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It all depends on what you decide to do with it.\"\n \n\"Hmmm,\" said Jack. \"Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request, after this one?\"\n \n\"Maybe,\" said Nate, \"it depends on what you decide then. There are more rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second request. You know how it goes.\" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had shoulders.\n \n\"Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent health doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially. Do I need to sign in blood or something?\"\n \n\"No,\" said Nate. \"Just hold out your hand. Or heel.\" Nate grinned. \"Or whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said, that's how it works - the poison, you know,\" Nate said apologetically.\n \nJack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it didn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better about the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot snake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to be able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack tried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it wouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.\n \n\"Hey, Jack,\" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind him, \"is that someone else coming up over there?\"\n \nJack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of nowhere? And did they bring food?\n \nWait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...\n \nJack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through his jeans...\n \nJack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. \"I would have decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to hoodwink me like that.\"\n \n\"I've been doing this a long time, Jack,\" said Nate, confidently. \"You humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you - especially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of minutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the health benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now.\"\n \n\"Yeah, well, still,\" said Jack, \"it's the principle of the thing. And nobody likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or something instead?\"\n \n\"More meat in the typical human butt,\" replied Nate. \"And less chance you accidentally kick me or move at the last second.\"\n \n\"Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify to hear,\" answered Jack.\n \n\"Ok,\" said Nate. \"Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to just start talking?\"\n \n\"Just talk,\" said Jack. \"I'll sit here and try to not think about food.\"\n \n\"We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,\" answered Nate.\n \n\"Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!\" Jack jumped up. \"What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically whip up food along with your other powers?\" Jack was almost shouting with excitement. His stomach had been growling for hours.\n \n\"I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite it for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife, that is,\" replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to.\n \n\"Ugh,\" said Jack, sitting back down. \"I think I'll pass. I can last a little longer before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it is you find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw. No thanks. Just talk.\"\n \n\"Ok,\" replied Nate, still grinning. \"But I'd better hurry, before you start looking at me as food.\n \nNate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued. \"You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden.\"\n \nJack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate sceptically.\n \n\"Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack,\" said Nate. \"Stand up and look at the symbol on the rock here.\" Nate gestured around the dark stone they were both sitting on with his nose.\n \nJack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a representation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around was coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches left the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it looked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and embedded in the stone than it did like a carving.\n \nJack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the setting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the sky.\n \nWait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another night out here! Arrrgh!\n \nJack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and stood next to Nate. \"In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate,\" said Jack. \"Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to have to head back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw desert critters for long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to.\"\n \n\"It's about 30 miles that way.\" Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail this time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to the way he'd been going when he was crawling here. \"But that's 30 miles by the way the crow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be able to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head out early tomorrow, Jack.\"\n \nJack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and then sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading out right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting stuff. \"Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?\"\n \n\"Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway,\" said Nate. \"He figured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a 'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he could never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from across the ocean. He worried about that for a while.\"\n \n\"Garden of Eden, hunh?\" said Jack. \"How long have you been here, Nate?\"\n \n\"No idea, really,\" replied Nate. \"A long time. It never occurred to me to count years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I do remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands of years, at least.\"\n \n\"So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?\" said Jack.\n \n\"Beats me,\" said Nate. \"Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your kind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it could have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant requests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals.\"\n \n\"Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out of the stone there?\" asked Jack.\n \n\"Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much bigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember if it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But one day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do something for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've been here ever since.\n \n\"What is this place?\" said Jack. \"And what did he ask you to do?\"\n \n\"Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?\" Nate loosened his coils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into the stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to enter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned over and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as Jack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but Nate was suddenly there in the way.\n \n\"You can't touch that yet, Jack,\" said Nate.\n \n\"Why not?\" asked Jack.\n \n\"I haven't explained it to you yet,\" replied Nate.\n \n\"Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something,\" said Jack. \"You'd push it that way, and it would move in the slot.\"\n \n\"Yep, that's what it is,\" replied Nate.\n \n\"What does it do?\" asked Jack. \"End the world?\"\n \n\"Oh, no,\" said Nate. \"Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it 'The Lever of Doom'.\" For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing voice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and grinned.\n \nJack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned Jack laughed. \"Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it really do?\"\n \n\"Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said,\" smirked Nate. \"I just thought the voice I used was funny, didn't you?\"\n \nNate continued to grin.\n \n\"A lever to end humanity?\" asked Jack. \"What in the world is that for? Why would anyone need to end humanity?\"\n \n\"Well,\" replied Nate, \"I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment. Or maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really bad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are the rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I\ndidn't think to ask back when I started here.\"\n \n\"Rules? What rules?\" asked Jack.\n \n\"The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it unless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human can be bound in that way at a time. That's it.\" explained Nate.\n \nJack looked somewhat shocked. \"You mean that I could pull the lever now? You'd let me end humanity?\"\n \n\"Yep,\" replied Nate, \"if you want to.\" Nate looked at Jack carefully. \"Do you want to, Jack?\"\n \n\"Umm, no.\" said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. \"Why in the world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want that! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too, wouldn't it?\"\n \n\"Yep,\" replied Nate, \"being as he'd be human too.\"\n \n\"Has anyone ever seriously considered it?\" asked Nate. \"Any of those bound to secrecy, that is?\"\n \n\"Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or another. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and think, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get disgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while. But he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here.\" Nate grinned some more.",

No one but their creator understands their internal logic;\n2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else;\n3. Even the smallest mistakes are stored in long term memory for possible later retrieval; and\n4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half\nyour paycheck on accessories for it.\n\nThe women's group, however, concluded that computers should be Masculine (\"un ordinateur\"), because:\n1. In order to do anything with them, you have to turn them on;\n2. They have a lot of data but still can't think for themselves;\n3. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time they ARE\nthe problem; and\n4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that if you had waited a little longer, you could have gotten a better model.\n\nThe women were right\n",

He quickly realized he had a problem: time had run its course, and both horses had long manes and tails. He called up Rufus to deliver the shocking news.

Thought you gys would appreciate it.\n-------------------------------------------\n\nSo this guy is walking home from work one day when he passes by an alley. A hooker approaches him and asks him if he wants to buy a blowjob for $20.\n\nThe guy finds that that's pretty fucking expensive for a blowjob, so he says no. She assures him that it will be the greatest blowjob that he's ever had. So, eager to test that theory out, he pays her and brings her back to his dorm room.\n\nSo they get into his room and she turns off the lights so that it's pitch black. She unbuckles his belt and starts going to town, and as she's doing this, she also starts singing the Star Spangled Banner. Once she gets to the end of the song, he blows his load and the guy admits that it was indeed the best blowjob he's ever gotten.\n\nSo his roomate gets home and he tells him about how the hooker gave him the best blowjob of his life while singing the Star Spangled Banner. His friend was skeptical, so he decides to hire the hooker out to see if that's really true. Sure enough she comes into his room, turns the lights off and starts blowing him while singing The Star Spangled banner, and as the song finishes, so does he.\n\nSo he was pretty amazed by this, but also curious. He goes to his friend and says \"Alright man, we need to find out how she's doing that. So here's what we're going to do. I'll hide in the closet and you hire her tomorrow. Once she starts, anytime into it, I want you to burst in and turn on the lights.\"\n\nSo his friend agrees to the plan. The next day, they hire the hooker, while one of them remained hidden in the closet the entire time. So sure enough, the hooker turns the lights off and begins working on him. She's giving him the blowjob of his life, and once she finally gets to the songs famous high note \"And the home of the freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\", the other roomate quickly bursts out of the closet and turns the light on.\n\nHe looks at the hooker and sees his friend's dick in one of her hands, and a glass eye in the other.",

He popped the clutch, hit the gas, and three seconds later he was flying down the road 90 miles an hour.\n\nHe chuckled to himself as he thought about how impressed the old guy must have been. He glanced up at his rear-view mirror, and then did a double take. Something was gaining on him fast. \n\nHe caught a glimpse as it whizzed past him. It was the old guy on the moped. His legs were sticking straight out to the sides, his head was down, his mouth was open, and he was doing at least 200.  The young man's jaw went slack with amazement as he watched the old guy disappear over the horizon. He let off the accelerator and slowed, continuing to stare. \n\nSeconds later, a tiny speck appeared. It was the old guy again, headed back towards him. He flew past and vanished into the distance behind him. \n\nThe young man stopped his car, turned around in his seat and stared out his rear window in disbelief. And here came the old guy again. He was flying! He got closer, and closer, and WHAM!!! RIGHT INTO THE BACK OF THE CAR!!!\n\nThe young man jumped out, and the scene was just an absolute mess. One of the moped's wheels was bouncing down the road, the other up in a tree. The old guy's helmet was in two pieces. His goggles were cracked. Blood was coming out his mouth, and one of his legs was twisted up beside his shoulder. \n\nIn a panic, the young man knelt down beside him. \u201cMISTER?! CAN YOU HEAR ME?!

A little perplexed, he calls the RSPCA and gets put through to the Gorilla Dept.. Turns out this is a common enough occurrence, and before long he is helping an RSPCA officer unload equipment from the back of a van. Officer Terry removes a long pointy stick, a pair of handcuffs, a double barrel shotgun, and a huge Pit Bull Terrier on a chain.\n\n As the pair make their way towards the tree, they see the Gorilla, hanging out, swinging lazily from branch to branch. Terry begins to explain in a thick Australian accent:\n\n\"Very simple operation this, basically I climb a little ways up into this tree here, give our hairy friend a couple of jabs with this pointy stick. Sure enough, he'll lose his grip and come crashing down. This is where you come in, mate- you're gonna want to let that dog off the chain. Pit Bull he is, bred special for the job. He'll go straight for that Gorilla's balls, lock his jaws together tight and won't let go til he's torn those bollocks right off.\"\n\n Terry clocks the horrified expression on the man's face and continues, \"This Gorilla ain't a dummy though, he knows all this, its in his nature see, so as soon as he hits the ground, you just watch both his hands shoot down to protect his plumbs. That's where the handcuffs come in mate - you 'cuff him, we load him in the van, and your gorilla problems are over, mate. What d'ya reckon?\"\n\n The man mulls all this over for minute, understandably a little skeptical, but finally agrees, and Terry starts his climb up into the tree. With Terry about half way up, the man calls out, \"What's the shotgun for?\"\n\n Terry stops climbing and turns, deadly serious for the first time all morning, \"If I fall, shoot the fuckin' dog.\"",

By a surprising coincidence, both were blind from birth. One day, the bunny was hopping through the forest, and the snake was slithering through the forest, when the bunny tripped over the snake and fell down. This, of course, knocked the snake about quite a bit. \"Oh, my,\" said the bunny, \"I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. I've been blind since birth, so, I can't see where I'm going. In fact, since I'm also an orphan, I don't even know what I am.\" \"It's quite OK,\" replied the snake. \"Actually, my story is much the same as yours. I, too, have been blind since birth, and also never knew my mother. Tell you what, maybe I could slither all over you, and work out what you are, so at least you'll have that going for you.\" \"Oh, that would be wonderful\" replied the bunny. So the snake slithered all over the bunny, and said, \"Well, you're covered with soft fur; you have really long ears; your nose twitches; and you have a soft cottony tail. I'd say that you must be a bunny rabbit.\" \"Oh, thank you! Thank you,\" cried the bunny, in great excitement. The bunny suggested to the snake, \"Maybe I could feel you all over with my paw, and help you the same way that you've helped me.\" So the bunny felt the snake all over, and remarked, \"Well, you're smooth and slippery, and you have a forked tongue, no backbone or no balls. I'd say you must be French.\"\n\n[The French General And The British Major]\nDuring one of the many wars that the French and the British fought and the French usually lost, the French just happened to capture a British Major.  An officer brought the Major to the French general for interrogation.  The French general began ridiculing the Major for wearing \"that stupid red tunic.\"  The French general said, \"Why to you wear that red uniform, it makes it easy for us to shoot you.\"  The British major replied, \"If I do get wounded, the blood will not show, and my soldiers will not get scared.\"  The French general said, \"That is a very good idea,\" The Frenchy turned to his orderly and said, \"From now on all French officers will wear brown pants.\"\n\n[U.N. Meeting]\nMember nations of the UN gathered for an annual Meeting of technological advancement reports. The United States ambassador stood and proudly announced, \"We have developed a space craft that can fly directly into the sun!\" The crowd was shocked murmurs and exclamations of \"How could this be!\" were heard. His assistant quickly handed him a sheet of paper, he coughed and then addressed the audience, \"I'm sorry, actually, our new space craft can only fly 3 centimeters below the sun.\" The Japanese ambassador stood next and told the gathering, \"Our Japanese scientists have invented a midget submarine that can touch the bottom of the deepest part of the ocean.\" Again, shock and disbelief rang through the great meeting hall. An assistant jumped up and whispered in the Japanese Ambassador's ear. He bowed deeply and said, \"My deepest apologies, forgive my mistake. Our new submarine can only reach 3 centimeters above the deepest part of the ocean.\" It was now the French ambassador's turn to make announcement of France's contribution. He stood and looked around, \"We in France have been able to develop people that can eat with their noses!\" Now the UN meeting as in shock and visible horror that France would play with genetic engineering. \"Actually, they eat only 3 centimeters below their noses.\"\n\n[Famous French Quotes]\nFamous quotes about the French: \"I just love the French. They taste like chicken!\" ---- Hannibal Lecter \"France has neither winter nor summer nor morals. Apart from these drawbacks it is a fine country. France has usually been governed by prostitutes.\" ---Mark Twain \"I would rather have a German division in front of me than a French one behind me.\" --- General George S. Patton \"The French are a smallish, monkey-looking bunch and not dressed any better, on average, than the citizens of Baltimore. True, you can sit outside in Paris and drink little cups of coffee, but why this is more stylish than sitting inside and drinking large glasses of whiskey I don't know.\" --- P.J O'Rourke (1989) .\n\n[The American And The French Woman]\nThe only seat available on the train was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged French woman and the seat was being used  by her dog. The weary traveler asked, \"Ma'am, please move your dog. I need that seat.\"   The French woman looked down her nose at the American, sniffed and said, You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see my little FiFi is using that seat?\" The American walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing the woman with the dog. Again he asked, \"Please, lady. May I sit there?\". I'm very tired.\" The French woman wrinkled her nose and snorted \"You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant....Imagine!\" The American didn't say anything else. Hhe leaned over, picked up the dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat. The woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her honor and chastise the American. An English man sitting across the aisle spoke up indignantly \"You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your autos on the wrong side of the road. And now, Sir, you've thrown the wrong bitch out the window.\" \n\n[New Brains For Old]\nThree guys are walking down a street when they see a new store with a sign that reads,\"CELEBRITY BRAIN SHOPPE, REPLACE YOUR BRAIN WITH THAT OF A DECEASED CELEBRITY\" All three decide to go in and give it a shot.

The clerk types on his computer and says, \"okay, that will be 3,000 dollars.\" The guy pays and leaves. The second guy walks up and says \"hello, I\u2019d like to buy a brain\" to which the clerk replies \"Who would you like?\" The guy thinks for a moment and decides on singer Mick Jagger's brain. The clerk types on his computers and says, \"Okay, that will be 4,000 dollars.\" The guy pays and then leaves. The Third guy walks up to the counter and says \"hello, I\u2019d like to buy a brain.\" to which the clerk replies \"who would you like?\" The guy thinks long and hard and then eventually decides on former French president Chirac. The clerk types on his computer and then says, \"okay, that will be 1.6 million dollars!\" The guy's jaw drops \"1.3 million dollars! Why does Chirac's brain cost so damn much?\" The clerk replies, \"well sir, it's never been used.\"\n\n[The Englishman And The Aliens] \nAn Englishman was rowing a boat down a river and singing, \"Rule Britannia\".  He had sung the first line, \"When Britain first at heaven's command ...\", when some aliens saw him. The aliens decided to conduct an experiment, so they removed half his brain, and put him back into his boat.  To their astonishment, he continued to sing, \"When Britain first at heaven's command...\". So, to continue their experiment, they removed half of the remainder of his brain, so he had a quarter of his brain left.  They were further astonished when the man continued to sing, \"When Britain first at heaven's command...\" After discussing further, they removed the final part of his brain and put him back in his boat.  He continued to sing, \"Allouetta, chantez allouetta ...\" \n\n[The Frenchman And The Landlord]\nA Frenchman walks into a bar, smiles at the landlord and orders a glass of wine.

She looked at the display of brains and saw that American brains were $4.95 per lb, British brains were $4.90 per lb and French brains were $450.00 per lb.  She gasped and asked the butcher if the price of the French brains were a misprint.  \"No ma'am,\" answered the butcher. \"That is the correct price.\"  \"Well, why are the French brains so expensive?\" exclaimed the cannibal.  \"Do you know how many French it takes to get a pound of brains!?\" replied the butcher. \n\n[The American, The German And The Frenchman]\nThree men, an American man, a German man, and a Frenchman, completely drunk, after a late night dinner, are having a conversation: The American: \u201cIn my country we have buildings that are over 1000-floor high\u201d. The German says: \u201cIn my country, we have highways that go straight for over a thousand miles!\u201d The Frenchman says: \u201cWhen I have an erection, my dick is so long, 14 eagles can perch on it!\u201d The following day, the three men, admitting too much alcohol told the truth: The American said: \u201cYou know, really, some of our buildings might go over 100-floor high, but no more.\u201d The German says: \u201cYou know, really, some highways might go 200 miles straight; but no more.\u201d The Frenchman said: \u201cYou know, really, when I have an erection, the 14th eagle has only one leg on it.\u201d \n\n[Bush And The French Ambassador]\nPresident Bush and the French ambassador to the U.N. were debating the Iraqi crisis. The President tried to explain through an interpreter that if we don't stop Hussein soon, he will obtain nuclear weapons.  He further explained that should that happen, any future likely conflict with the madman could result in a bloodbath.  The French ambassador did not understand.  It seems there is no word for \"bath\" in French. \n\n[High-Tech]\nGeorge W. Bush, Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac were relaxing in a Parisian sauna.  Suddenly, there was a distinct beeping sound. President Bush pressed his forearm with his thumb & the beeping stopped.  The others looked curiously at him.  \"Oh, that was just my pager\", said George.  \"I have a microchip embedded under the skin of my forearm.\" Two minutes later, the silence was broken by the sound of a phone ringing.  Tony Blair lifted the palm of his hand to his ear & the ringing stopped.  The Prime Minister explained, \"That was my cell phone, chaps.  I have a telecom chip implanted in the palm of my hand. \"By this time, French president Jacques Chirac was feeling sort of low-tech.  Without saying anything, he quickly scooted out of the sauna, but returned momentarily.  When he returned, Bush and Blair both stared at him incredulously. It appeared that a long piece of toilet paper was dangling from the Frenchman's posterior. When Jacques saw that he had the attention of the other two men, he feigned astonishment: \"Marie Sainte!   I'm think I'm getting a fax.\" \n\n[The Genie]\nThree guys, an Englishman, a Frenchman and an American are out walking along the beach together one day. They come across a lantern and a genie pops out of it.  \"I will give you each one wish, \" says the genie.  The American says, \"I am a farmer, my dad was a farmer, and my son will also farm. I want the land to be forever fertile in America.\" With a blink of the genie's eye, 'FOOM'  -  the land in America was forever made fertile for farming.  The Frenchman was amazed, so he said, \"I want a wall around France, so that no one can come into our precious country.\"  Again, with a blink of the Genie's eye, 'POOF'  -  there was a huge wall around France.  The Englishman asks, \"I'm very curious. Please tell me more about this wall.  The Genie explains, \"Well, it's about 150 feet high, 50 feet thick and nothing can get in or out.\"  The Englishman says, \"Fill it up with water.\"\n\n[Pierre And The Gorilla]\nThe French zoo had acquired a very rare species of gorilla. Within a few weeks, the female gorilla became very cranky and difficult to handle. Upon examination, the zoo veterinarian determined the problem. The gorilla was in heat. To make matters worse, there were no male gorilla species available. While reflecting on their problem, the zoo administrators noticed Pierre, an employee responsible for cleaning the animals' cages. Pierre, it was rumored, had the ability to satisfy any female, but he wasn't very bright. So the zoo administrators thought they might have a solution.  Pierre was approached with a proposition: would he be willing to have sex with the gorilla for five hundred Francs? Pierre showed some interest, but said he would have to think the matter over carefully. The following day, Pierre announced that he would accept their offer, but only under three conditions. \"First,\" he said, \"I don't want to have to kiss her. Secondly, I want nothing to do with any offspring that may result from this union.\" The zoo administration quickly agreed to these conditions, so they asked what about the third condition. \"Well,\" said Pierre, \"you've gotta give me another week to come up with the five hundred Francs.\" \n\n[The Frenchman, The Englishman And Claudia Schiffer]\nThere was a Frenchman, an Englishman and Claudia Schiffer sitting together in a carriage in a train going through Provence. Suddenly the train went through a tunnel and as it was an old style train, there were no lights in the carriages and it went completely dark. Then there was a kissing noise and the sound of a really loud slap. When the train came out of the tunnel, Claudia Schiffer and the Englishman were sitting as if nothing had happened and the Frenchman had his hand against his face as if he had been slapped there. The Frenchman was thinking: 'The English fella must have kissed Claudia Schiffer and she missed him and slapped me instead.' Claudia Schiffer was thinking: 'The French fella must have tried to kiss me and actually kissed the Englishman and got slapped for it.' And the Englishman was thinking: 'This is great. The next time the train goes through a tunnel I'll make another kissing noise and slap that French bastard again.' \n\n\n\n",

        "body": "So, there's a man crawling through the desert.\n\nHe'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.\n\nHe stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out\nand he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.\n\nHe thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon\nhow dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So,\nhe puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication\nlater, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give\nhim a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle\nin case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the\ndirection he thinks is right.\n\nHe walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's\nbeen sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and\nwhether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.\n\nHe pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.\n\nBy the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the\ntown. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.\n\nAs it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things,\nhe finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.\n\nFull dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back\nup and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.\n\nHe wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.\n\nHe knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.\n\nHe rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in\nhis mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't\nfind water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.\n\nThen he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.\n\nLooking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.\n\nAs he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.\n\nHe decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait\nany longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large\nrock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly\nswallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry\nand cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes\nanother mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle.\nHe figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to\nmake some difference and keep himself from passing out.\n\nHe's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him,\nit kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty\nsure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.\n\nHe walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills,\ndunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water.\nSometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.\n\nAfter a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat\nstroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.\n\nAfter more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He\nknows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing\ndonuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy\nenough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if\nhe's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it,\ntrying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.\n\nHe was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.\n\nHe walks through the sand.\n\nAfter a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't\nremember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he\ndoesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.\n\nBut, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures\nthat he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from\nthere that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.\n\nHalfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third\ntime, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll\njust fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.\n\nWhile crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally\ngotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through\nthe sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert\nin the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any\nrips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape -\nshake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.\n\nHe finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top,\nhe struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees\nis sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he\nsees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more\ndunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.\n\nAgain, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper\nfluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the\ncap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from\nhere. He's going to have to go down there and look.\n\nHe puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune.\nAfter a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.\n\nHe stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough\nenergy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When\nhe clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot\nin the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.\n\nSo, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins\nto crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to\nhave the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages\nof dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't\nhave water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last\nchance.\n\nHe gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the\ndark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting\nhis head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just\nkeeps crawling.\n\nFinally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center,\nwhere his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone\narea.\n\nHis mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark\nstone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun\noverhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying\ndown on the nice cool surface.\n\nCool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's\nprobably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and\ndying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the\nbeautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him\na drink. Then he'll know he's gone.\n\nHe decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here\nin the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the\ncenter before he goes. He keeps crawling.\n\nIt's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's\nhearing. He would swear that someone just said, \"Greetings, traveler. You do\nnot look well. Do you hear me?\"\n\nHe stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and\nknees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something\ndifferent - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few\nseconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and\ntries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands\nand tries again. Better this time.\n\nYep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse\nof stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or\npole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet\nout of the stone, at an angle.\n\nAnd wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and\nseeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long\ndesert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.\n\nHe stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and\nrun away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his\nfinal resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to\nmove from this spot.\n\nWell, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than\ndying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a\nlittle straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves\nit in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a\nmoment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.\n\nHmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet -\nthat was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.\n\nHe then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here\nbecause he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was\nlikely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was\nnow on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had\nactually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white\npost sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe\nthey were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake\nwas even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.\n\nHe tries to clear his throat to say, \"Hello,\" but his throat is too dry. All\nthat comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going\nto be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the\nbottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out,\nalmost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't\ngood. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes\nout.\n\nHe gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips,\nand pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then\nswallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk\nnow.\n\nHe tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to\nspot the owner of this place, and croaks out, \"Hello? Is there anyone here?\"\n\nHe hears, from his side, \"Greetings. What is it that you want?\"\n\nHe turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed\nto come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a\nspeaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides\nto try asking for help.\n\n\"Please,\" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, \"I'd love to not be\nthirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?\"\n\nLooking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was\ncoming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its\nmouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he\nfalls forward, face first on the stone, \"Very well. Coming up.\"\n\nA piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits\nup and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily\ndisoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the\nsand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped\naround the tilted white post, still looking at him.\n\nHe reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet.\nHe pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder\nagain - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes -\nthey match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been\nbitten. By the snake.\n\n\"It'll feel better in a minute.\" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He\nhadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more\nimportantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!\n\n\"Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the\nafterlife?\"\n\n\"Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,\" says the snake. \"That's the way I\nwork. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.\"\n\n\"You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a\ndrink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be\nthirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for\nthe windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk?\nAre you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?\"\n\n\"No,\" says the snake, \"I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I\ndidn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I\nbite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just\nsitting around here.\"\n\nThe man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the\ndesert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a\nsnake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not\ngreat - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no\nlonger thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt\nhot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool\nstone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer\ndying of thirst.\n\n\"I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your\nsystem with the next request,\" continued the snake. \"I can guess why you\ndrank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left\nin the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or\ntwo, if you drank enough of it.\"\n\n\"Ummm, n-next request?\" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting\nshoulder and backed away from the snake a little.\n\n\"That's the way it works. If you like, that is,\" explained the snake. \"You\nget three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish.\" The snake grinned at his\nown joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.\n\n\"But there are rules,\" the snake continued. \"The first request is free. The\nsecond requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of\nresponsibility.\" The snake looks at the man seriously.\n\n\"By the way,\" the snake says suddenly, \"my name is Nathan. Old Nathan,\nSamuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound\nused to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand\nfor it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into\nnames. You can call me Nate, if you wish.\" Again, the snake grinned. \"Sorry\nif I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds\nsomewhat threatening.\" The snake give his rattle a little shake.\n\n\"Umm, my name is Jack,\" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. \"Jack\nSamson.\n\n\"Can I ask you a question?\" Jack says suddenly. \"What happened to the\npoison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that?\nWhat do you mean by that's how you work?\"\n\n\"That's more than one question,\" grins Nate. \"But I'll still try to answer\nall of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question.\" The snake's grin gets\nwider. \"Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need\nto drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not\nbe thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make\nit permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at\nall. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to\nget enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert.\nYou've been changed.\n\n\"For the third question,\" Nate continues, \"you are still dying. Besides the\neffects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal.\nIn your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years.\nAssuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is.\" Nate seemed vastly\namused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.\n\n\"As for the fourth question,\" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack\ncould tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read\ntalking-snake emotions from snake facial features, \"first you have to agree\nto make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell\nyou.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" joked Jack, \"isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd\nhave to kill me?\"\n\n\"I thought that was implied.\" Nate continued to look serious.\n\n\"Ummm...yeah.\" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was\ntalking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a\nnasty temper. \"So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really\nstop the effects of the methanol?\" Jack thought for a second. \"And, what do\nyou mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper\nfluid, and just denature it?\"\n\n\"They may, I don't really know,\" said Nate. \"I haven't gotten out in a\nwhile. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and\non that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you\npulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume\nthat they still color wiper fluid blue?\"\n\n\"Yeah, they do,\" said Jack.\n\n\"I figured,\" replied Nate. \"As for being bound by secrecy - with the\nfulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me,\nthis place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you\ndecide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me,\nwrite about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will\nlead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of\ncourse, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm\nguessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding\nanyway, so you won't notice.\" Nate said the last part with utter confidence.\n\nJack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a\nlittle nervous at this. \"Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know\nthat? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?\"\n\nWell, Jack,\" said Nate sadly, \"I can't tell you that, unless you make the\nsecond request.\" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.\n\n\"Umm, well, ok,\" said Jack, \"what is this about a second request? What can I\nask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?\"\n\n\"Sure!\" said Nate, brightening. \"You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes\nto yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and\nbefore you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or\nomnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous\nand yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and\nsort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be\nomniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very\nuseful, at least in my opinion.\" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was\nstaring at him.\n\n\"Well, anyway,\" continued Nate, \"I'd probably suggest giving you permanent\ngood health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be\nimmune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long\ntime, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to\nrecover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a\nrequest to me.\"\n\n\"Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?\" said Jack. \"And keep me healthy for a\nlong time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request\nabout a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not\nreally a change to me?\"\n\n\"Right,\" nodded Nate.\n\n\"Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?\" Jack asked, hopefully.\n\n\"That takes two requests, Jack.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I figured so,\" said Jack. \"But I could ask to be a genius? I could\nbecome the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?\"\n\n\"Well, I could make you very smart,\" admitted Nate, \"but that wouldn't\nnecessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you\nvery athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either.\nYou've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some\ntruth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It\nall depends on what you decide to do with it.\"\n\n\"Hmmm,\" said Jack. \"Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request,\nafter this one?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Nate, \"it depends on what you decide then. There are more\nrules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second\nrequest. You know how it goes.\" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had\nshoulders.\n\n\"Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent\nhealth doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially.\nDo I need to sign in blood or something?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Nate. \"Just hold out your hand. Or heel.\" Nate grinned. \"Or\nwhatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said,\nthat's how it works - the poison, you know,\" Nate said apologetically.\n\nJack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it\ndidn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better\nabout the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot\nsnake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to\nbe able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack\ntried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it\nwouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.\n\n\"Hey, Jack,\" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind\nhim, \"is that someone else coming up over there?\"\n\nJack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of\nnowhere? And did they bring food?\n\nWait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...\n\nJack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through\nhis jeans...\n\nJack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. \"I would have\ndecided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to\nhoodwink me like that.\"\n\n\"I've been doing this a long time, Jack,\" said Nate, confidently. \"You\nhumans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you -\nespecially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of\nminutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the\nhealth benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, still,\" said Jack, \"it's the principle of the thing. And nobody\nlikes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or\nsomething instead?\"\n\n\"More meat in the typical human butt,\" replied Nate. \"And less chance you\naccidentally kick me or move at the last second.\"\n\n\"Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify\nto hear,\" answered Jack.\n\n\"Ok,\" said Nate. \"Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to\njust start talking?\"\n\n\"Just talk,\" said Jack. \"I'll sit here and try to not think about food.\"\n\n\"We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,\"\nanswered Nate.\n\n\"Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!\" Jack jumped up.\n\"What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically\nwhip up food along with your other powers?\" Jack was almost shouting with\nexcitement. His stomach had been growling for hours.\n\n\"I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite\nit for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife,\nthat is,\" replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to.\n\n\"Ugh,\" said Jack, sitting back down. \"I think I'll pass. I can last a little\nlonger before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it\nis you find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw.\nNo thanks. Just talk.\"\n\n\"Ok,\" replied Nate, still grinning. \"But I'd better hurry, before you start\nlooking at me as food.\n\nNate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued.\n\"You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden.\"\n\nJack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate\nsceptically.\n\n\"Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack,\" said Nate. \"Stand up\nand look at the symbol on the rock here.\" Nate gestured around the dark\nstone they were both sitting on with his nose.\n\nJack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a\nrepresentation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around\nwas coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches\nleft the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it\nlooked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and\nembedded in the stone than it did like a carving.\n\nJack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the\nsetting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the\nsky.\n\nWait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another\nnight out here! Arrrgh!\n\nJack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and\nstood next to Nate. \"In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate,\" said\nJack. \"Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to\nhave to head back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw\ndesert critters for long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to.\"\n\n\"It's about 30 miles that way.\" Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail\nthis time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to\nthe way he'd been going when he was crawling here. \"But that's 30 miles by\nthe way the crow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be\nable to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head\nout early tomorrow, Jack.\"\n\nJack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and\nthen sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading\nout right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting\nstuff. \"Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway,\" said Nate. \"He\nfigured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a\n'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he\ncould never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from\nacross the ocean. He worried about that for a while.\"\n\n\"Garden of Eden, hunh?\" said Jack. \"How long have you been here, Nate?\"\n\n\"No idea, really,\" replied Nate. \"A long time. It never occurred to me to\ncount years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I\ndo remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands\nof years, at least.\"\n\n\"So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?\" said Jack.\n\n\"Beats me,\" said Nate. \"Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your\nkind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it\ncould have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant\nrequests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals.\"\n\n\"Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out\nof the stone there?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much\nbigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember\nif it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But\none day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do\nsomething for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've\nbeen here ever since.\n\n\"What is this place?\" said Jack. \"And what did he ask you to do?\"\n\n\"Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?\" Nate loosened his\ncoils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into\nthe stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to\nenter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned\nover and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as\nJack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but\nNate was suddenly there in the way.\n\n\"You can't touch that yet, Jack,\" said Nate.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I haven't explained it to you yet,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something,\" said Jack. \"You'd push it\nthat way, and it would move in the slot.\"\n\n\"Yep, that's what it is,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"What does it do?\" asked Jack. \"End the world?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Nate. \"Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it\n'The Lever of Doom'.\" For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing\nvoice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and\ngrinned.\n\nJack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned\nJack laughed. \"Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it\nreally do?\"\n\n\"Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said,\" smirked Nate. \"I just thought\nthe voice I used was funny, didn't you?\"\n\nNate continued to grin.\n\n\"A lever to end humanity?\" asked Jack. \"What in the world is that for? Why\nwould anyone need to end humanity?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Nate, \"I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment.\nOr maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really\nbad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are\nthe rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I\ndidn't think to ask back when I started here.\"\n\n\"Rules? What rules?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it\nunless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human\ncan be bound in that way at a time. That's it.\" explained Nate.\n\nJack looked somewhat shocked. \"You mean that I could pull the lever now?\nYou'd let me end humanity?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate, \"if you want to.\" Nate looked at Jack carefully. \"Do\nyou want to, Jack?\"\n\n\"Umm, no.\" said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. \"Why in\nthe world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want\nthat! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too,\nwouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate, \"being as he'd be human too.\"\n\n\"Has anyone ever seriously considered it?\" asked Nate. \"Any of those bound\nto secrecy, that is?\"\n\n\"Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or\nanother. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and\nthink, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get\ndisgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while.\nBut he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here.\" Nate grinned some more.\n\nJack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at\nthe same time. After a bit, he said, \"So this makes me the Judge of\nhumanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?\"\n\n\"That seems to be it,\" agreed Nate.\n\n\"What kind of criteria do I use to decide?\" said Jack. \"How do I make this\ndecision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are\nbad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" replied Nate. \"You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's\nup to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed\nto know.\"\n\n\"But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel\nhorrible? Couldn't I make a mistake? How do I know that I won't screw up?\"\nprotested Jack.\n\nNate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. \"You don't. You just have to\ntry your best, Jack.\"\n\nJack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly\ngetting dark, chewing on a fingernail.\n\nSuddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. \"Nate, was Samuel the\none bound to this before me?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Nate. \"He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to\nread and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried\nin the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months\nago.\"\n\n\"Sounds like a good guy,\" agreed Jack. \"How did he handle this, when you\nfirst told him. What did he do?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Nate, \"he sat down for a while, thought about it for a bit, and\nthen asked me some questions, much like you're doing.\"\n\n\"What did he ask you, if you're allowed to tell me?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"He asked me about the third request,\" replied Nate.\n\n\"Aha!\" It was Jack's turn to grin. \"And what did you tell him?\"\n\n\"I told him the rules for the third request. That to get the third request\nyou have to agree to this whole thing. That if it ever comes to the point\nthat you really think that humanity should be ended, that you'll come here\nand end it. You won't avoid it, and you won't wimp out.\" Nate looked serious\nagain. \"And you'll be bound to do it too, Jack.\"\n\n\"Hmmm.\" Jack looked back out into the darkness for a while.\n\nNate watched him, waiting.\n\n\"Nate,\" continued Jack, quietly, eventually. \"What did Samuel ask for with\nhis third request?\"\n\nNate sounded like he was grinning again as he replied, also quietly,\n\"Wisdom, Jack. He asked for wisdom. As much as I could give him.\"\n\n\"Ok,\" said Jack, suddenly, standing up and facing away from Nate, \"give it\nto me.\n\nNate looked at Jack's backside. \"Give you what, Jack?\"\n\n\"Give me that wisdom. The same stuff that Samuel asked for. If it helped\nhim, maybe it'll help me too.\" Jack turned his head to look back over his\nshoulder at Nate. \"It did help him, right?\"\n\n\"He said it did,\" replied Nate. \"But he seemed a little quieter afterward.\nLike he had a lot to think about.\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, I can see that,\" said Jack. \"So, give it to me.\" Jack turned to\nface away from Nate again, bent over slightly and tensed up.\n\nNate watched Jack tense up with a little exasperation. If he bit Jack now,\nJack would likely jump out of his skin and maybe hurt them both.\n\n\"You remember that you'll be bound to destroy humanity if it ever looks like\nit needs it, right Jack?\" asked Nate, shifting position.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, I got that,\" replied Jack, eyes squeezed tightly shut and body\ntense, not noticing the change in direction of Nate's voice.\n",

They gave of their sweat and toil so that there should be a fertile country for us. He was impressed with their unselfish toil and decided to immigrate to Israel and be a pioneer.\n\nHe went to the Jewish Agency and applied to come on Aliyah. They asked him what he did and when they found out that he was a computer genius, they promptly assured him that he would be taken care of in Israel. They set him up in a nice apartment in North Tel Aviv in a modern building with a job in a equally modern building a short ride away.\n\nAfter a few months in Israel his pioneering spirit began to plague him. He wanted to feel like a pioneer and he felt that there was no difference between his life in Tel Aviv to that of his native New York. So he went out and bought a camel.\n\nEvery day he would ride his camel to his office and in the evening he would ride it back. Now at least he felt that he was in the Middle-East. But after several weeks of riding the camel he came out and it was gone.\n\nHe called the missing camel department of the Israeli police who promptly sent out an senior investigator to help find his camel.\n\n\"Tell me sir, I need some information so that we can look for it. Was it a dark brown camel or a light brown one?\"\n\n\"I don't exactly remmember the color\" he said.\n\n\"Okay, tell me did it have one hump or two?\"\n\n\"Hmmm, I really did not pay attention, I sat on a saddle\"\n\n\"Well then, did it have a long tail or a short tail?\"\n\n\"Gee, I really did not notice\"\n\n\"Do you remember the color of the eyes.\"\n\n\"No, I haven't any idea.\"\n\n\"Well you probably don't know if it was a male camel or a female.\"\n\n\"Ah, that I do know!

And he's pissed because she is pissed (that's how their relationship works)\n\nThey pull into port. She didn't want to leave her room because of how distraught she was.

It seemed a little strange, but I ignored it. However, when another waiter brought our water and utensils, I noticed that he too had a spoon in his shirt pocket. Looking around the restaurant I saw that all the staff seemed to have spoons in their pockets.\n\nWhen the waiter came back to serve our soup I asked, \"Why the spoon? \"\n\"Well,\" he explained, \"half a year ago, the restaurant's owners hired Anderson Consulting, experts in efficiency, in order to revamp all our processes. After several months of statistical analysis, they concluded that customers drop their spoons 73.84 percent more often than any other utensil. This represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour. If our personnel is prepared to deal with that contingency, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 1.5 man-hours per shift.\"\n\nAs luck would have it I dropped my spoon and he was able to replace it with his spare spoon. \"I'll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now\", he said.\nI was rather impressed.\n\nThe waiter served our main course and I continued looking around. I then noticed that there was a very thin string hanging out of the waiter's fly. Looking around, I noticed that all the other waiters had the same string hanging from their flies. Now I got really curious and before he walked off, I asked the waiter, \"Excuse me, but can you tell me why you have that string right there?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly!\" he answered, lowering his voice. \"Not everyone is as observant as you. That consulting firm I mentioned earlier also found out that we can save time in the restroom. See, by tying this string to the tip of the penis, we can pull it out over the urinal without touching it and that way eliminate the need to wash our hands, thus shortening the time spent in the restroom by 76.39 percent.\"\n\n\"Okay, that makes sense\", I said, \"but . . . if the string helps you get it out, how in hell do you get it back in again?\"\n\n\"Well\", he whispered, lowering his voice even further, \"I don't know about the others but . . . as for me, I use the spoon.\"",

One day the chief had passed, and his wife and daughter were planning a funeral away from the village. One Stone, realizing the passing of the chief made him the newest man of the tribe, had decreed that henceforth he shall be called Turk and never again One Stone, and whoever disobeyed him shall be taken far from the village and raped to death. The widow of the chief returns to the village, and asks One Stone to help with the funeral plans. He agrees, but on the way to the funeral spot he takes her off the side of the road and rapes her to death. As he returns the daughter of the chief also returns and asks \"One Stone, have you seen my mother?\" He tells her he has and will take her. As they near her mother's body, he takes her astray and begins to rape her. Over and over he rapes her, but she will not die!

A small rabbit saw the crow, and asked him, \"Can I also sit like you and do nothing all day long?\" The crow answered: \"Sure why not.\" So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested. All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it.  \nManagement Lesson: To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up.  \n*#2* A turkey was chatting with a bull. \"I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,\" sighed the turkey, \"but I haven't got the energy. \"Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?\" replied the bull. \"They're packed with nutrients.\" The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave him enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree. The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. Finally after a fourth night, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. Soon he was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree. Management Lesson: Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there.   \n*#3* When the body was first made, all the parts wanted to be Boss. The brain said, \"I should be Boss because I control the whole body's responses and functions.\" The feet said, \" We should be Boss as we carry the brain about and get him to where he wants to go. The hands said, \"We should be the Boss because we do all the work and earn all the money.\" And so it went on and on with the heart, the lungs and the eyes until finally the asshole spoke up. All the parts laughed at the idea of the asshole being the Boss. So the asshole went on strike, blocked itself up and refused to work. Within a short time the eyes became crossed, the hands clenched, the feet twitched, the heart and lungs began to panic and the brain fevered. Eventually they all decided that the asshole should be the Boss, so the motion was passed.  \nManagement Lesson: You don't need brains to be a Boss - any asshole will do.  \n*#4* A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold, the bird froze and fell to the ground in a large field. While it was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on it. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, it began to realize how warm it was. The dung was actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out. Then he ate him!  \nManagement Lessons:  \n1) Not everyone who drops shit on you is your enemy.  \n2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend.  \n3) And when you're in deep shit, keep your mouth shut!",

These two guys go out on the lake with their guns, a dog, and of course the new vehicle. They drive out onto the lake ice and get ready.\n\n\nNow, they want to make some kind of a natural landing area for the ducks, something for the decoys to float on. In order to make a hole large enough to look like something a wandering duck would fly down and land on, it's going to take a little more effort than an ice hole drill. So, out of the back of the new Navigator truck comes a stick of dynamite with a short, 40-second fuse.\nNow, these two Rocket Scientists do take into consideration that they want to place the stick of dynamite on the ice at a location far from where they are standing (and from the new Navigator truck), and they don't want to take the risk of slipping on the ice when they run from the lit dynamite fuse and possibly go up in smoke with the resulting blast. They light the 40-second fuse and throw the dynamite as far away as they can.\n\nRemember a couple of sentences back when I mentioned the vehicle, the guns, and the dog??\nLet's talk about the dog: it's a highly trained Labrador used for RETRIEVING. Especially well trained at retrieving things thrown by the owner. You guessed it, the dog takes off at a high rate of doggy speed on the ice and captures the stick of dynamite with the burning 40-second fuse about the time it hits the ice. The two men yell, scream, wave their arms and wonder what to do now. The dog, cheered on, keeps coming.\nOne of the guys grabs the shotgun and shoots the dog. The shotgun is loaded with #8 birdshot, hardly big enough to stop a Lab. The dog stops for a moment, slightly confused, but continues on. Another shot and this time the dog, still standing, becomes really confused and of course terrified, thinking these two geniuses have gone insane. The dog takes off to find cover, under the brand new Navigator truck..\nThe men continue to yell as they run away. The exhaust pipe on the truck is still hot, so the dog yelps and drops the dynamite under the truck, and takes off after his master.\n\nThen --BOOM-- the truck is blown to bits and sinks to the bottom of the lake in a very large hole, leaving the two idiots standing there with this \"I can't believe this happened\" look on their faces.\n\nThe insurance company says that sinking a vehicle in a lake by illegal use of explosives is NOT COVERED. He still had yet to make the first of those $560.00 a month payments!!!\n\nAnd you thought your day was not going well.",

The American pulls up the data for the counts detected by the gamma detector on the other side of the iron.\n\nThe American says, \"So, on a scale of one to ten, we'll call iron's shielding capabilities about a seven.\"\n\nThe American then takes away the iron and puts a 3-inch plate of lead in front of the gamma source. He once again allows the system to collect data, and after the same amount of time, shows the Japanese engineer how the counts have gone down significantly.\n\nThe American engineer says, \"We'll say that's about a nine.\"\n\nFinally, the American engineer replaces the lead with a 3-inch thick slab of their newly-developed material, and allows the test to run for the same amount of time. When he shows the data to the Japanese engineer, the counts are almost zero--far below the counts recorded for lead.\n\nThe Japanese engineer, astonished, asks, \"So what do we call that?\"\n\nThe American responds, \"A ten, you Asian.\"\n\nEdit: It works better if you read it aloud.",

Two weeks later, when he took the bandages off he saw that, in his haste, he had switched the two. He now had a big toe growing out of the middle of his face. He claimed that he got used to it and it wasn\u2019t really so bad, except that whenever he wanted to blow his nose he had to take his shoe off.",

The nun doesn't golf - she is just enjoying a lovely spring morning and watching her friend play the game he loves.\n\nThe priest tees up and drives the ball and it curves sharply and goes completely off the fairway into the distance, and the priest immediately exclaims, \"FUCKIN SHIT I MISSED!\"\n\nThe nun is taken aback, but she's a conservative lady not accustomed to confrontation, so she keeps her mouth shut and hopes it is a fluke.\n\nIt's not - repeatedly, throughout the course, the priest is having what must be the worst golf round ever - repeatedly duffing the ball, going off the fairway, into the sand, into the water, and every time - \"FUCKIN SHIT I MISSED!!!\"  It's really bothering the nun.\n\nFinally they get to the 17th hole and he does this and the nun says, \"Father, father, you are a servant of the lord, you cannot continue to use this language.  It's a terrible sin, surely he will punish you!\"  The priest, pissed off that he's playing such a bad round, replies, \"Just shut the hell up.\"\n\nSo they get to the 18th hole.  The priest tees up, swings, and MISSES THE BALL COMPLETELY.  He screams out at the top of his lungs, \"FUCKIN SHIT I MISSED!!!\" \n\nAll of a sudden the blue sky is replaced with black clouds that roll in quickly, instantly turning the beautiful day dark and ominous.

How can you explain the scratch? \n\nS- Well, as I've said before, I have no recollection of scratching the car. While it is true that I did take the car out last night, I did not scratch it.\n\nD- \nBut your sister, Monica, has told me she saw you back the car against the mailbox at the end of the driveway, heard a loud scraping sound, saw you get out to examine the car, and then drive away. So again I'll ask you, yes or no, did you scratch the car? \n\nS- \nOh, you mean you think you have evidence to prove I scratched it. Well, you see, I understood you to mean did \"I\" scratch the car. I stand by my earlier statement, that I did not scratch the car.\n\nD- \nAre you trying to tell me you didn't drive the car into the mailbox? \n\nS- \nWell, you see sir, I was trying to drive the car into the street. I mishandled the steering of the car, and it resulted in direct contact with the mailbox, though that was clearly not my intent.\n\nD- So you are then saying that you did hit the mailbox? \n\nS- No sir, that's not my statement. I'll refer you back to my original statement that I did not scratch the car.\n\nD- \nBut the car did hit the mailbox, and the car did get scratched as a result of this contact? \n\nS- Well, yes, I suppose you could look at it that way. \n\nD- So you lied to me when you said you did not scratch the car? \n\nS- No. No, that's not correct. Your question was \"Did I scratch the car?\". From a strict legal definition, as I understood the meaning of that sentence, I did not scratch the car... the mailbox did... I was merely present when the scratching occurred. So my answer of \"No\" when you asked \"Did I scratch the car\" was legally correct, although I did not volunteer information. \n\nD- Where did you learn to talk like a complete idiot?\n\nS- From The President of the United States.",

One day the husband went away to a horse show in a difrerent state and the wife decided to try something new.  She went on craigslist and posted an ad looking for some company.  Within minutes, she had hundreds of replies, a lot of them including pictures of some really good-looking guys.  The wife could not decide, so she invited  not one, not two, but three guys over to her house!  She ran to thr grocery store and bought some liquor, deciding that they should get wasted first and have a little party and then see where things might lead.  Pretty soon the guys showed up, and in real life they looked even better.  They all were chilling on the porch, sipping their booze and having a really fine time-things just started getting more interesting- when the wife all of a sudden spotted her husband's bright red truck in the distance. \n-Oh no! My husband is back already! Quick, guys! Hide somewhere!\nHowever, there weren't many good hiding spots in or around the house.  Then suddenly one of the men spotted some burlap sacks lying in the backyard next to the barn.   Each guy climbed into a sack and curled up in a fetal position, afraid to move.  Soon they heard a man's voice: \n-Hey honey, I am back! The horse fair ended early! \nThen the husband walked out to the backyard and noticed the sacks.\n-Heey, what's that?\n-Oh, that? While you were gone, I got bored and went to a local farm fair myself.  These are the prizes I won!\n-Reeally? Lemme see what's in there.\nThe husband approaches the first sack and gives it a nice kick with his cowboy boot. \n-Oink! Oink! - the first guy yelps\n-Must be a piglet, niiice- says the farmer and kicks the second bag\n-Baa! - screams the second guy\n- A sheep? Really good! - says the farmer.- Now let's see what's in here- and he gives the third sack a solid kick. Silence. -Hmm, weird- says the farmer and gives the sack a harder kick.  Silence again. - What the hell,- says the farmer and kicks the bag as it it was a freaking soccer ball. Then, suddenly the sack yells:\n- Don't you fucking get it, dimwit?! If you kicked and there's no sound, it must be potatoes!",

There was a knife on the bedside table so naturally,the dead man's wife was called in for questioning once again. \n\"You killed him,didn't you?\" Asked Josephine. \"You stabbed him with the knife that was on the bedside table,all because you didn't want to sleep with your husband. Am I right?\" \n\"N-no! I w-wouldn't kill him. I C-couldn't k-kill anyone!\" The wife exclamed,shocked that this could even be considered a possibility. \nAfter another half-hour of interrogation,Josephine became quite convinced that the wife wasn't to blame.

The first snow of the season and the wife and I took our cocktails and sat for hours by the window watching the huge soft flakes drift down from heaven. It looked like a Grandma Moses Print. So romantic we felt like newlyweds again. I love snow! \n\nDecember 9: 2006\nWe woke to a beautiful blanket of crystal white snow covering every inch of the landscape. What a fantastic sight! Can there be a lovelier place in the Whole World? Moving here was the best idea I've ever had. I shoveled for the first time in years, felt like a boy again. I did both our driveway and the sidewalks. This afternoon the snowplow came along and covered up the sidewalks and closed in the driveway, so I got to shovel again. What a perfect life. \n\nDecember 12: 2006\nThe sun has melted all our lovely snow. Such a disappointment. My neighbor tells me not to worry; we'll definitely have a white Christmas. No snow on Christmas would be awful! Bob says we'll have so much snow by the end of winter, that I'll never want to see snow again. I don't think that's possible. Bob is such a nice man, I'm glad he's our neighbor. \n\nDecember 14: 2006\nSnow, lovely snow! 8\" last night. The temperature dropped to -20. The cold makes everything sparkle so. The wind took my breath away, but I warmed up by shoveling the driveway and sidewalks. This is the life! The snowplow came back this afternoon and buried everything again. I didn't realize I would have to do quite this much shoveling, but I'll certainly get back in shape this way. I wish I wouldn't huff and puff so. \n\nDecember 15: 2006\n20 inches forecast. Sold my van and bought a 4x4 Blazer. I bought snow tires for the wife's car and two extra shovels. Stocked the freezer. The wife wants a wood stove in case the electricity goes out. I think that's silly. We aren't in Alaska, after all.\n \nDecember 16: 2006\nIce storm this morning. Fell on my ass on the ice in the driveway putting down salt. Hurt like hell. The wife laughed for an hour, which I think was very cruel. \n\nDecember 17: 2006\nStill way below freezing. Roads are too icy to go anywhere. Electricity was off for five hours. I had to pile the blankets on to stay warm. Nothing to do but stare at the wife and try not to irritate her. Guess I should've bought a wood stove, but won't admit it to her. God I hate it when she's right. I can't believe I'm freezing to death in my own living room. \n\nDecember 20: 2006\nElectricity's back on, but had another 14\" of the damn stuff last night. More shoveling. Took all day. Goddamn snowplow came by twice. Tried to find a neighbor kid to shovel, but they said they're too busy playing hockey. I think they're lying. Called the only hardware store around to see about buying a snow blower, and they're out. Might have another shipment in March. I think they're lying. Bob says I have to shovel or the city will have it done and bill me. I think he's lying. \n\nDecember 22: 2006\nBob was right about a white Christmas, because 13 more inches of the white shit fell today, and it's so cold it probably won't melt 'til August. Took me 45 minutes to get all dressed up to go out to shovel, and then I had to piss. By the time I got undressed, pissed and dressed again, I was too tired to shovel! Tried to hire Bob, who has a plow on his truck, for the rest of the winter; but he says he's too busy. I think the asshole is lying. \n\nDecember 23: 2006\nOnly 2\" of snow today, and it warmed up to \"0\". The wife wanted me to decorate the front of the house this morning. What, is she nuts!!! Why didn't she tell me to do that a month ago? She says she did, but I think she's lying. \n\nDecember 24: 2006\n6\". Snow packed so hard by snowplow, I broke the shovel. Thought I was having a heart attack. If I ever catch the son-of-a-bitch who drives that snowplow, I'll drag him through the snow by his balls and beat him to death with my broken shovel. I know he hides around the corner and waits for me to finish shoveling and then he comes down the street at a 100 miles an hour and throws snow all over everywhere I've just been! Tonight the wife wanted me to sing Christmas carols with her and open our presents, but I was too busy watching for the Goddamn snowplow. \n\nDecember 25: 2006\nMerry F!@@!! Christmas. 20 more inches of the !@@!! slop tonight. Snowed in. The idea of shoveling makes my blood boil. God, I hate the snow! Then the snowplow driver came by asking for a donation and I hit him over the head with my shovel. The wife says I have a bad attitude. I think she's a fricking idiot. If I have to watch \"It's a Wonderful Life\" one more time, I'm going to stuff her into the microwave. \n\nDecember 26: 2006\nStill snowed in. Why the hell did I ever move here? It was all HER idea. She's really getting on my nerves. \n\nDecember 27: 2006\nTemperature dropped to -30, and the pipes froze. Plumber came after 14 hours of waiting for him; he only charged me $1,400 to replace all my pipes. \n\nDecember 28: 2006\nWarmed up to above -50. Still snowed in. The BITCH is driving me crazy!!!!! \n\nDecember 29: 2006\n10 more inches. Bob says I have to shovel the roof or it could cave in. That's the silliest thing I ever heard. How dumb does he think I am? \n\nDecember 30: 2006\nRoof caved in. I beat up the snow plow driver. He is now suing me for a million dollars; not for only the beating I gave him, but also for trying to shove the broken snow shovel up his ass. The wife went home to her mother. 9\" predicted. \n\nDecember 31: 2006\nI set fire to what's left of the house. No more shoveling. \n\nJanuary 8: 2007\nFeel so good. I just love those little white pills they keep giving me. Why am I tied to the bed?\n\n",

Of course, then we would have a lot of people voting for a candidate born on July 3 or December 26, just for the long weekends. --Age 8\n\n\n\n Democracy is a beautiful thing, except for that part about letting just any old yokel vote. --Age 10\n\n\n\n Home is where the house is. --Age 6\n\n\n\n I bet living in a nudist colony takes all the fun out of Halloween. --Age 13 \n\n\n\nI often wonder how come John Tesh isn't as popular a singer as some people think he should be.

That's what happens to cheese when you leave it out. --Age 6 \n\n\n\nMy young brother asked me what happens after we die. I told him we get buried under a bunch of dirt and worms eat our bodies. I guess I should have told him the truth--that most of us go to hell and burn eternally --but I didn't want to upset him. --Age 10\n\n\n\n I gaze at the brilliant full moon. The same one, I think to myself, at which Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato gazed. Suddenly, I imagine they appear beside me. I tell Socrates about the national debate over one's right to die and wonder at the constancy of the human condition. I tell Plato that I live in the country that has come the closest to Utopia, and I show him a copy of the Constitution. I tell Aristotle that we have found many more than four basic elements and I show him a periodic table. I get a box of kitchen matches and strike one. They gasp with wonder. We spend the rest of the night lighting farts. --Age 15\n\n\n\n When I go to heaven, I want to see my grandpa again. But he better have lost the nose hair and the old-man smell. --Age 5\n\n\n\n I once heard the voice of God. It said \"Vrrrrmmmmm.\" Unless it was just a lawn mower. --Age 11\n\n\n\n I don't know about you, but I enjoy watching paint dry. I imagine that the wet paint is a big freshwater lake that is the only source of water for some tiny cities by the lake. As the lake gets drier, the population gets more desperate, and sometimes there are water riots. Once there was a big fire and everyone died. --Age 13\n\n\n\n I like to go down to the dog pound and pretend that I've found my dog. Then I tell them to kill it anyway because I already gave away all of his stuff. Dog people sure don't have a sense of humor. --Age 14 \n\n\n\nAs you make your way through this hectic world of ours, set aside a few minutes each day. At the end of the year, you'll have a couple of days saved up. --Age 7 \n\n\n\nOften, when I am reading a good book, I stop and thank my teacher. That is, I used to, until she got an unlisted number. --Age 15 \n\n\n\nIt would be terrible if the Red Cross Bloodmobile got into an accident. No, wait. That would be good because if anyone needed it, the blood would be right there. --Age 5\n\n\n\n Think of the biggest number you can. Now add five. Then, imagine if you had that many Twinkies. Wow, that's five more than the biggest number you could come up with! --Age 6\n\n\n The only stupid question is the one that is never asked, except maybe \"Don't you think it is about time you audited my return?\" or \"Isn't it morally wrong to give me a warning when, in fact, I was speeding?\" --Age 15\n\n\n\n Once, I wept for I had no shoes. Then I came upon a man who had no feet. So I took his shoes. I mean, it's not like he really needed them, right? --Age 15\n\n\n\n If we could just get everyone to close their eyes and visualize world peace for an hour, imagine how serene and quiet it would be until the looting started. --Age 15\n\n\n\n\n\ndont forget to add yours in comments. also tell us your favourite.",

I\u2019m so sorry to ask. Can you please help me out?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026what? Help you out?\u201d\n\u201cI REALLY have to go. Pleeease.\u201d the cripple pleads as he looks down. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have an accident.\u201d\n\nThe first fellow looks around and sees there is no one else around to help. He looks back to the armless man.\n\n\u201cOk \u2026 uh, what do you need?\u201d\n\u201cCan you pleeeease just take my dick out and point it at the urinal?\u201d\n\u201cOh man\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPLEASE! I can\u2019t \u2026 I can\u2019t hold it much longer and I can\u2019t go out there \u2026\u201d he look back towards the door. \u201cI can\u2019t go out there with piss all over me.\u201d He looks near to tears at this point.\n\nThe first fellow looks at the armless man again, noticing the tears welling up in his eyes. \u201cWhat kind of heartless bastard would I be to let this poor guy suffer? There but for the Grace of God\u201d, he thinks to himself.\n\n\u201cOk, ok. Let\u2019s just make this quick.\u201d\n\nHe unzips the cripple\u2019s fly and pulls his underwear down a bit.\nThe stench hits his nose first and his head reels back. My god, it\u2019s like buzzard pus that\u2019s been left in the sun to fester.\n\n\u201cPlease! Please! I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m usually at home in my own restroom and can do this on my own. I just spent too long out today. Please help me!\u201d\n\nThe good samaritan decides to just power though the terrible situation and gently reaches in with thumb and forefinger.\n\nWhat he pulls out is a grotesque monstrosity. The armless man\u2019s penis is covers in weeping sores and boils. It has purple and yellow bruise marks and looks like it\u2019s seen the business end of a meat tenderizer. It drips a yellow custard from the encrusted tip.\n\n\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d the helper exclaims.\n\u201cHurry! Just point it at the urinal!\u201d\n\nAs the gnarled man root is pointed at the urinal, a large stream is unleashed and the armless man lets out a hearty sigh. The piss is mercilessly done quickly and the helping hands are quick to stuff the junk back into the trunk.\n\n\u201cWait! You need to give it a shake.\u201d\n\u201cNo WAY!\u201d\n\u201cC\u2019mon. I can\u2019t go out there with pee tracks all over me.\u201d\n\n*sigh* The EXCEEDINGLY good Samaritan gives two quick tugs to shake the dew off the lily and then quickly tucks the battered wang back in the grateful man\u2019s pants.\n\nThe first fellow runs to the sink and sets the water to near scalding while practically emptying the liquid soap dispenser. As he scrubs his hands raw he looks back over his shoulder at the armless man who is turning to leave.\n\n\u201cHey man, I don\u2019t mean to pry, but I sort of feel you owe me one. What the HELL happened to your dick?\u201d\n\nThe armless man turns and says \u201cFuck if I know,\u201d as he adjusts his shirt and pops his arms out of his sleeve holes \u201cbut I\u2019ll be God damned if I\u2019M gonna\u2019 touch it.\u201d And walks out.",

He loved Lonnie, his two boys and his baby girl no matter she was named.\n\nNow Love didn't think anything of her name until she started elementary school. The higher the grade the more teasing she received. By the time she finished 8th grade, Love started to despise her own name.\n\nThen on to 9th grade, 10th grade and 11th grade. Her anger grew with the teasing she received. Upon graduation from the 12th grade, Love had enough. She knew what she had to do. \n\nBill and Lonnie had planned a celebrated dinner with Love later that night. Bill was at home waiting for Lonnie to return from shopping that evening as Love walked in the door. Without saying a word Love strode past Bill and headed straight for her room. Bill was a bit surprised by this. None the less he simply brushed it off and continued to finish reading his newspaper. \n\nNo less than 2 minutes later Love walks out of her room with a gun in hand and tears in her eyes. She points it straight at Bill. Shoots him in the chest screaming how it was unfair of him giving her such a horrible name. She then turns the gun on herself and puts a bullet in her own head.\n\nLonnie just returning home from the store walks in seeing the blood and the bodies of her husband and daughter, falls to her knees crying. She hears mumbling coming from Bill's mouth. She crawls over as Bill tries speaking. \"What is it honey. What happened here?\" she asks.\n\nBill looks into Lonnie's eyes and whispers. \"Shot though the heart, and you're to blame. You gave Love a bad name.\"",

One day he finally got fed up with his repetitive, insignificant life and decided that he would leave his hive, his family, his entire close-knit wasp community and he would go out into the world and make something of himself, just like the humans do. So the wasp enrolls in school, and passes with flying colors. Remember, this is a very smart wasp. He gets his high school diploma in a little under 3 years, with a 4.0 GPA and all that snazz. After high school, believe it or not, the wasp gets accepted to Harvard. Harvard! This too proves to be no challenge for our hero, as he graduates in just two years, again a 4.0, on the Dean's list, and all that snazz. Not to mention all the clubs and sports he was in-the newspaper, rowing, student government-and the fact that he was by far the most popular student on campus. Even his professors looked up to him.\u00a0\nHe goes on to get two PhDs, and when he finishes his education, the wasp faces a bit of a dilemma. How does he apply his knowledge now? Where does he go from here? He decides to try out politics. After all, he was popular throughout school, did well in Harvard government. So he runs for mayor, and wins in a landslide. He greatly reforms the city, fixing virtually all its major problems. He runs for governor and again wins in a landslide. Two years later, the presidential election was coming up, and the wasp decides he might as well go for it.\u00a0\nOf course, he wins in the largest landslide in US presidential history. His presidency goes exceedingly well-he is loved by all parties, and has the highest approval ratings in history. He also finds the cures for cancer, AIDS, and broken hearts while in the White House. After 8 years (yes, of course he was reelected) the time has come for him to leave his office. Even his successor his saddened by the wasp\u2019s departure, but they all know it\u2019s what must be done. Back at his vacation home in California his first day after leaving office, the wasp looks back on his long and fruitful life. He realizes that he hasn't been back to his hive at all since that first day he left. He suddenly feels a twang of guilt as he realizes how much he misses his parents and his little brother. So he heads back to the hive, looking more worn out than he remembers. He goes inside and greets his family, who are overjoyed at the sight of him. He talks about how his life has gone as his family listens in wonderment. Eventually he decides he is thirsty, so he decides to visit the old watering hole he remembered. Once he gets there though, there\u2019s an extremely long line. He decides it\u2019s worth the wait, so gets in line. One hour. Two hours. This is the slowest moving line he\u2019s ever seen! Eventually he calculates that it could be a few days before he gets to the front of the line, so decides it\u2019s not worth it. He decides to go get some cider to drink instead, but waddya know, another huge line of people waiting for cider! He remembers one other drinking area that never had a long line-fruit punch! So he decides to go get punch. He arrives, and lo and behold, there's no punch line.\n\n",

When suddenly his friend Pepito sitting next to him nudges him and passes him a folded paper. He grabs the paper and opens it. 'Purple'. He is so confused. He whispers to his friend \"What the fuck are you talking about?\" \"Hey!\" says the teacher. \"Bring that up here right now!\" Chris gets up and hands him the note. \"What have we got here?\" says the teacher. He opens the note to read out loud to the class...\"Pur...............son of bitch\" The teacher murmurs to himself. \"Go to the principles office right now and show him this note!\" Chris asks why but the teachers yelling became louder. He storms out and heads to the principles office. He shows up to the principles office and the principle can see he is very confused. \"Whats the problem son?, your not the type to cause trouble\" Chris hands him the paper explaining what happened. The principle opens the note, fold it back, and hands it back to Chris....\"You get the fuck out this school this instant or I call the police\" Chris is starting to think this is a joke and doesnt move, but the principle grabs the phone and so Chris gets up to leave. Chris ends up going home to his dad and explains what happened. Hi father asks to see the note and starts pushing Chris out the door. \"Youre not my fucking son anymore you piece of shit, Dont ever come back!. Chris is pissed and doesnt know what the hell is going on. Chris decides to go to his girlfriends house see if she can help him. \"Well let me see the note\" Chris tells her not to freak out like every body else that saw the note. \"Babe you know I love you, I wont freak out I promise\" Chris hands her the note and prepares for the worst. He grabs the note out of her hands...and she starts punching and kicking him out the door. \" You fucking bastard, were done!\" Chris starts begging her to stop and explain why she is pissed off and why everyone is mad at him...but she is going crazy so Chris decides to leave. 12 yrs go by and Chris has traveled the world searching for answers he winds up im Mexico sitting in a door way drinking heavily.

Like \"The Aristocrats,\" the artistry to telling this joke is in the embellishment and artistry of spinning an engaging tale to setup the punchline. Your mileage may vary--this is the core of the joke.]\n\nDown along a small port town along the boat docks, an assortment of sailors, fishermen, and docksworkers were all having a pint or two after work at the local pub.\n\nAs the burly bunch enjoyed their drinks and spun tales of their adventures, a crusty old man entered the establishment. Normally, a patron does not draw much attention as he enters this friendly establishment, but the noise of his wooden peg leg caught the ears of everyone. A hush of whispers swept over the bar as they all turned and noticed his wooden prosthesis, his hook, and his patched eye. \n\nThe man looked around with his one blood-shot eye, sat at the end of the bar, and said in a raspy voice, \"Bar keep, rum. Leave the bottle.\"\n\nThe bar was quiet for a bit until one young sailor found the courage to sit next to the old sea dog and inquire about his injuries. \n\n\"Pardon me, sir. I couldn't help but notice your peg leg. I bet it has an interesting story. Would you mine telling me about it?\"\n\nThe old man took a hard tug from his rum bottle and set it down on the bar without looking. \n\nThe young man started to turn away but the old man said, \"Aye--yer wantin' to know about me leg. I'll tell ya, but be warned: it's not for the faint o'heart.\"\n\nThe young man moved closer, \"Please, sir. Tell me about your adventures!\" \n\n\"Aye, 'twas when I was about your age. I was in the company of some, let's just say they were men of questionable business ventures. We boarded a vessel to...\" The old man looked around the room noticing a few interested evesdroppers and and stage whispered, \"we were salvaging some cargo from another vessel. One thing led to another and I found myself in the water. A steel cable had me by the ankle and me head was going under fast. I was in me grave. Me knife was no good on the cable. But, staring Davy Jones in the face, I had no choice as my leg was the only thing the knife could cut.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God, sir!\" said the young man. \n\n\"Aye, it was agonizing. The sharks would have had me but me mates pulled me to safety and took care of me leg. It took me months to recover.\"\n\nA crowd was gathering around the two. Another sailor asked, \"Sir, tell of the hook. What happened?\"\n\n\"It's a terrible story--you don't want to hear it.\"\n\n\"No, no. Tell us!\" the crowd insisted. \n\n\"Aye, but be warned, it's much worse than the leg.\" \n\n\"Go on!\" said the young sailor eager to hear more tales.\n\n\"We were in port taking leave. I was a bit lonely for female companionship. I found meself with a beautiful woman who must have taken pity on me because me leg.  In the middle of our pleasures, I discover she had witheld the information about her state of matrimony with the blacksmith. He burst into our quarters and, being a bit slow on me peg leg, I wasn't able to break free from this mountain of a man. He drags me away to his shop and his fit of rage, he force me hand into a molten vessel of steel.\"\n\n\"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, sir!\" shouted the bartender, \"That's horrible!\"\n\nThe old man nodded looking down at his prosthesis. \"Aye, 'tis. But the blacksmith took pity upon me when he sobered from his rage. He made me this sharpened hook as both an apology and a reminder of what happened that night.\"\n\n\"Tell us about the eye!\" said the crowd of everyone in the bar. \n\nThe old man refused. \"No, 'tis the worst of me tales. Ya don't want to know.\"\n\n\"Tell us!\" they inssisted. \n\nThe old man took a deep breath. Without moving his head from its prayer over his rum, his squinty eye turned to the young man. \"Aye, I'll tell you.\"\n\nEveryone leaned in. \n\n\"I was on watch. It was quiet. Eerily quiet. I heard a strange noise from below one of the hatches. It was a young woman. A stow away. She promised me favors as a trade for me silence on the matter.\" \n\nThe bar was silent in anticipation of the forthcoming details.\n\n\"Well, I was a young man and weak to the desires of me flesh. I accepted her offer but when she saw me injuries she had a rather suddent change of mind.\"\n\n\"What happened? She stabbed you with dagger?\" asked the young sailor.\n\"She scratched your eye out?\" asked another.\n\n\"No, no. She spit square into me eye.\"\n\nThe crowd was silent for a moment. The young, now indignant, barked, \"Bullshit, sir. A woman's spit your eye out?\"\n\n\"No, lad.\" He said holding up his steely prosthesis, \"It was me first day with the hook.\"",

I want to buy one. \n\nABBOT: Mac? \n\nCOSTELLO: I told you, my name is Bud. \n\nABBOT: What about Windows? \n\nCOSTELLO: Why? Does it get stuffy? \n\nABBOT: Do you want a computer with Windows? \n\nCOSTELLO: I don't know. What do I see when I look out the windows? \n\nABBOT: Wallpaper. \n\nCOSTELLO: Never mind the windows. I need a computer and software. \n\nABBOT: Software that runs on Windows? \n\nCOSTELLO: No, on the computer! I need something I can use to write proposals, track expenses. You know, run a business. What have you got? \n\nABBOT: Office. \n\nCOSTELLO: Yeah, for my office. Can you recommend anything? \n\nABBOT: I just did. \n\nCOSTELLO: You just did what? \n\nABBOT: Recommended something. \n\nCOSTELLO: You recommended something? \n\nABBOT: Yes. \n\nCOSTELLO: For my office? \n\nABBOT: Yes. \n\nCOSTELLO: Okay, what did you recommend for my office? \n\nABBOT: Office. \n\nCOSTELLO: Yes, for my office. \n\nABBOT: Office for Windows. \n\nCOSTELLO: I already have an office and it already has windows! Let's say I'm sitting at my computer, and I want to type a proposal. What do I need? \n\nABBOT: Word. \n\nCOSTELLO: If I'm writing a proposal, I'm going to need lots of words. But what program do I load? \n\nABBOT: Word. \n\nCOSTELLO: What word? \n\nABBOT: The Word in Office. \n\nCOSTELLO: The only word in office is office. \n\nABBOT: The Word in Office for Windows. \n\nCOSTELLO: Which word in \"office for windows?\" \n\nABBOT: The Word you get when you click the blue W. \n\nCOSTELLO: I'm going to click your big W if you don't give me a straight answer. Let's forget about words for a minute. What do I need if I want to watch a movie over the Internet? \n\nABBOT: RealOne. \n\nCOSTELLO: Maybe a real movie, maybe a cartoon. What I watch is none of your business. But what do I need to watch it? \n\nABBOT: RealOne. \n\nCOSTELLO: If it's a long movie I'll also want to watch reels two, three and four. Can I watch reel four? \n\nABBOT: Of course. \n\nCOSTELLO: Great! With what? \n\nABBOT: RealOne. \n\nCOSTELLO: Okay, so I'm sitting at my computer and I want to watch a movie. What do I do? \n\nABBOT: You click the blue 1. \n\nCOSTELLO: I click the blue one what? \n\nABBOT: The blue 1. \n\nCOSTELLO: Is that different from the blue W? \n\nABBOT: Of course it is. The blue 1 is Real One. The blue W is Word. \n\nCOSTELLO: What word? \n\nABBOT: The Word in Office for Windows. \n\nCOSTELLO: But there's three words in \"office for windows!\" \n\nABBOT: No, just one. But it's the most popular Word in the world. \n\nCOSTELLO: It is? \n\nABBOT: Yes, although to be fair there aren't many other Words left. It pretty much wiped out all the other Words. \n\nCOSTELLO: And that word is the real one? \n\nABBOT: No. Real One has nothing to do with Word. Real One isn't even part of Office. \n\nCOSTELLO: Never mind; I don't want to get started with that again. But I also need something for bank accounts, loans, and so on. What do you have to help me track my money? \n\nABBOT: Money. \n\nCOSTELLO: That's right. What do you have? \n\nABBOT: Money. \n\nCOSTELLO: I need money to track my money? \n\nABBOT: No, not really. It comes bundled with your computer. \n\nCOSTELLO: What comes bundled with my computer? \n\nABBOT: Money. \n\nCOSTELLO: Money comes bundled with my computer? \n\nABBOT: Exactly. No extra charge. \n\nCOSTELLO: I get a bundle of money with my computer at no extra charge? How much money do I get? \n\nABBOT: Just one copy. \n\nCOSTELLO: I get a copy of money. Isn't that illegal? \n\nABBOT: No. We have a license from Microsoft to make copies of Money. \n\nCOSTELLO: Microsoft can license you to make money? \n\nABBOT: Why not? They own it. \n\nCOSTELLO: Well, it's great that I'm going to get free money, but I'll still need to track it. Do you have anything for managing your money? \n\nABBOT: Managing Your Money? That program disappeared years ago. \n\nCOSTELLO: Well, what do you sell in its place? \n\nABBOT: Money. \n\nCOSTELLO: You sell money? \n\nABBOT: Of course. But if you buy a computer from us, you get it for free. \n\nCOSTELLO: That's all very wonderful, but I'll be running a business. Do you have any software for, you know, accounting? \n\nABBOT: Simply Accounting. \n\nCOSTELLO: Probably, but it might get a little complicated. \n\nABBOT: If you don't want Simply Accounting, you might try M.Y.O.B. \n\nCOSTELLO: M.Y.O.B.? What does that stand for? \n\nABBOT: Mind Your Own Business. \n\nCOSTELLO: I beg your pardon? \n\nABBOT: No, that would be I.B.Y.P. I said M.Y.O.B. \n\nCOSTELLO: Look, I just need to do some accounting for my home business. You know--accounting? You do it with money. \n\nABBOT: Of course you can do accounting with Money. But you may need more. \n\nCOSTELLO: More money? \n\nABBOT: More than Money. Money can't do everything. \n\nCOSTELLO: I don't need a sermon! Okay, let's forget about money for the moment. I'm worried that my computer might... what's the word? Crash. And if my computer crashes, what can I use to restore my data? \n\nABBOT: Go Back. \n\nCOSTELLO: Okay. I'm worried about my computer smashing and I need something to restore my data. What do you recommend? \n\nABBOT: Go Back. \n\nCOSTELLO: How many times do I have to repeat myself? \n\nABBOT: I've never asked you to repeat yourself. All I said was Go Back. \n\nCOSTELLO: How can I go back if I haven't even been anywhere? Okay, I'll go back. What do I need to write a proposal? \n\nABBOT: Word. \n\nCOSTELLO: But I'll need lots of words to write a proposal. \n\nABBOT: No, you only need one Word-the Word in Office for Windows. \n\nCOSTELLO: But there's three words in ...

She remembered getting a box of chocolates for her birthday, which had a big blue ribbon around it. She found it, and went back upstairs. \nPulling the blanket off, she made a loop, and waited while her husband snored.\n\nZzzz....zzzzzzzzz....ZZZZZZZZZZZZ- She pulled the loop in the ribbon tight around his penis, instantly stopping the snoring.

One day Lena had to use the bathroom so she bundled up, went to the outhouse, dropped her trousers and did her business. Lena is terrified of mouses, so when she saw the outhouse mouse peek its head from under the door, she let out a blood curdling scream. The scream frightened the mouse so he scurried up her thigh and crawled up in her ladyparts before Lena could get her trousers back up. She went running back into the house, screaming with her pants half down, saying, \"Ole! Ole! The outhouse mouse has crawled up inside of my virginny. You gotta help me!\" \n\nOle, not knowing what to do, called the local doctor to inform him of their predicament. The doctor said, \"I can't come to help you right now. I'm delivering the Olsen's baby. But here's what you do. You get Lena to sit with her legs open, get a piece of cheese and put it a few inches away from the, um, opening. When that outhouse mouse pops his head out to grab that cheese, you whack him in the head with a mallet. I'll be there as soon as I can.\"\n\nAn hour later, the doctor drops by Ole and Lena's house to see how they're doing. Sure enough Lena is sitting with her legs apart and Ole is hovering over her with a mallet poised to strike. But instead of cheese, there's a can of tuna fish a few inches away from Lena's \"opening.\"\n\nThe doctor says, \"Ole didn't you hear what I told ya? Tuna fish isn't going to work. You gotta use cheese. Mice love cheese!\"\n\nOle replies, \"I did exactly what you said, doc. I got a piece of cheese sitting right there. At first, nothing. But then the outhouse mouse poked his nose out. Then I could see his ears. He inched out a bit more so I could see his front feet.

However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.\nFinally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.'\nThe father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.'\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball.\nThe boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again.\nThe next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday.\nFather,' replied the son,I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.'\nThe father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, `If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.'\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.\nThe boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again.\nThe next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday.\nFather,' said the son to this,I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.'\nThe father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?'\n`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed.\nI can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father,but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.'\nAnd so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls.\nThe boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.\nDear son,' said the father,I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?'\nThe son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humour me, dear father.'\nThe carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again.\nThe next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday.\nDearest father,' the son started,I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.'\nOne of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory.\nThe next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home.\nThe following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left.\nThe following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong.\n`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.'\nIt was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country.\nThe next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there.\nFather,' the son said,You've made me very happy yet again.'\nThat night, the son spent on board the tanker.\nThe next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy.\nA few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital.\nHis father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?'\nWeakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.'\nThe father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.'\n`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.'\nThe father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk.\n`Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.'\nThe son nodded weakly.\nThe next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room.\n`Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,' the father requested.\nThe son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter.\n`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.\n`I- I-'\nThen he died.",

Finally the father breaks the silence.\n\n\"You know my daughter, she loves to screw.\"  \nThe boy couldn't believe his ears. \"Come again sir?\"  \n\"Yeah, she loves to screw. She tells me all the time. You two should do that tonight. It's her favorite!\"  \n\"Are you sure you're okay with that?\"  \n\"Sure! She can screw all night long, that girl.\"  \n\nThe boy, now excited, waited anxiously until his girlfriend was ready and took her to the dance with this new information at hand. The father even gives him a little wink as the couple leave the house. The boy couldn't be happier.\n\nA few hours later however, the daughter comes barreling home with tears streaming her face. The boy is running behind her with a visible red mark of a hand across his face. They get to the father and the daughter screams:\n\n\"It's called the TWIST dad! The fucking TWIST!\"",

        "body": "Yes. By some strange medical... Let's not call it a miracle... occurrence... Tommy Jenkins was born only a head.\n\nHis parents, Gregory and Judy, loved Tommy with all their hearts, and quickly adjusted their own lives to make sure that Tommy could have as close to a normal life as possible.\n\nAs soon as Tommy was old enough to ask questions, Judy brought him to museums, art films, and lectures, hoping to develop the only \"muscle\" Tommy possessed: his brain. By the time Tommy was three, he had a intellect that far surpassed the other children in his play group.\n\nOn Sundays, Gregory would sit with his boy and watch football on television. Tommy loved watching the athletics of Bob Griese and the Miami Dolphins. He and his father bonded over guessing Don't Shula's next move and marveling over the amazing season their favorite team was having.\n\nAt night, Tommy would roll around in his bed dreaming that he was a Super Bowl-winning quarterback, hoisted on the shoulders of his teammates. His mother and father would be in the stands, and the pride he would witness in Gregory's eyes, oh! It would make Tommy smile until morning.\n\nIt came time for Tommy to go to school, and Judy was tortured by what sending her boy, with his condition, would mean to him - what it would mean for their family. She loved him so much, and she wanted no harm to come to him, physically or psychologically. Gregory assured her it would be alright.\n\nHis first few weeks were tough. Of course, the other children didn't know what to make of a boy with no body, so they avoided him at first. Once he started speaking up in class, his preternatural intellect began to show. He baffled his teachers, who didn't quite know what to do with him, and he threatened the young boys in his class, who responded by being bullies of sorts.\n\nAt this time, his parents began having intense arguments about two things. The first was that Judy wanted to take Tommy out of school and home-school him, but Gregory felt that his son was resourceful enough to figure out a way to get through this hard part in his young life. He felt that it would further build his son's already strong character. The second thing that drove a wedge between this previously-unflappable couple was that Tommy's doctor announced that Tommy was eligible to be the first full-body transplant recipient the world has ever seen. Judy was against the operation because she felt that part of what made Tommy such a remarkable boy was that he WAS different than the other kids. She wanted to continue to celebrate that. Gregory knew how badly his boy wanted to be able to play football, and he fought vehemently to try to make Judy understand. Neither adult would budge.\n\nShortly after his parents received the news of Tommy's eligibility for surgery, Tommy had a wonderful breakthrough with his classmates. One afternoon, while his class was outside for recess, Tommy was watching the boys play a game of pickup football. He made a remark of how the boy playing quarterback should hand off to his running back in that particular situation, and they'd be sure the touchdown. It worked, and the boy, amazed at Tommy's knowledge of football tactics, asked him how he knew that. Tommy replied, \"That's what Shula would do.\" The boys in the class were flabbergasted by Tommy knowledge of the NFL and spent the rest of the recess period trying to stump him. They asked him player stats, scores, any trivia they could think of. He answered every question correctly.\n\nAt dinner that night, Gregory and Judy had never seen their son so happy. He was as animated as a little boy head could be, recounting the events of that afternoon's recess in beautiful, minute detail. His parents knew what they had to do. They told him about the surgery, to which he immediately accepted. The joy he felt that night going to bed has yet to be surpassed by any six-year old boy since.\n\nThe surgery was dangerous, but Tommy pulled through. Gregory and Judy were with him through every second of his stay in the hospital, whispering encouragement while he was in recovery, then shouting it to him while he struggled to learn how his new body works while in recovery. Judy relished holding her son's hand (HOLDING HIS HAND!!!) in his brief moments of doubt. The parents relationship was now as strong as it had ever been, now that they were sure they had made the right decision with Tommy.\n\nWhen Tommy finally came home from the hospital, school had ended. It was a beautiful June day. Tommy could feel the sun on his face and also over his brand-new limbs as he stepped out of the car in front of his house. All of his friends from school were there waiting for him, and he smiled as wide as could be when he saw them. They were so excited for him, and they invited him to the park across the street to play his very first game of football with them. He could even be quarterback, just like his idol, Bob Griese. He looked at Gregory and Judy, and they, of course, nodded their approval.\n\nSo, Tommy, his friends, and his parents crossed the street to watch what they knew would be the first of many football games that Tommy would play.\n\nOn the first play, Tommy threw the football off the head of one of his linemen. Nobody said a word. They all knew how hard Tommy worked to be able to have this moment. Tommy looked around for a moment, then said, \"Well, I guess I have to get the hang of my new arms.\" Everybody laughed and laughed. They teams of boys set up for the next play. Tommy called Hike, and still not quite understanding how to control his new limbs, hurled the football far over his teammates heads. The ball bounced three times and came to rest in the middle of the street. A slight flash of frustration appeared on little Tommy's countenance, but it quickly turned to a wide smile. \"I'll get it!\" He called, a started running to get the football. He stopped in the street and bent over to pick up the football, and was immediately struck by a mail truck, whose brakes were two months overdue for inspection.\n\nThe park erupted in the devastated keening of his friends and parents. Gregory stood like a statue, immobilized by grief. Judy took off in a blind bolt across the freshly-cut grass of the park, into the street, where she collapsed upon her son's lifeless body.\n\n\"Why?!?!\" Judy screamed at the sky. \"My boy! My beautiful boy!\" She continued, her face contorted in loss and grief. \"I knew it!!! I just knew it deep down inside my gut! You should have quit while you were ahead!\"\n\nEdit: breaks/ brakes",

        "body": "at Bobs local Gas Station. On the cage there is a large sign stating, \"DO NOT TOUCH UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.\"\nBob always found it to be rather peculiar that there was a Gorilla left in a cage at his local Gas Station, but hey ho.\nFor months he went about his commute to work, each day stopping at the Gas Station to top up. Each day his curiosity grew and grew. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Bob arrived at the Gas Station to top up and continue his usual mundane journey to work. He was a successful business man you see, pretty good at his job too. \n\nOne cold December morning, Bob, couldn't take it anymore. Instead of taking his Visa debit card from the reader and getting straight back into his car, he turned around. He turned around and caught the eyes of the large, hairy, dangerous- looking, and extremely angry beast. \nWith extreme caution, Bob, began to walk toward the Gorilla. Each step watched on by the angry mammal. \nBob stood no more than a foot away from the cage. He could feel the warm breath of the Gorilla on his face. \n\n\"I have waited too long for this,\" Bob uttered to himself. \n\nThe Gorilla, at this point had clasped the metal bars that separate them both. \nBob raised his clenched hand, barely an inch between the Gorillas hand and his. The sign seemed bolder than ever before, but Bob had had enough. He lifted his index finger and poked the Gorillas Right hand clasped on the bars.\n\nThe beast erupted. Bob fell to the floor and began to drag himself back to the car as the Gorilla began to tear the cage apart. There was a shower of debris falling around Bob as the Gorilla aggressively become more and more enraged as the cage began to disintegrate. \nBob stumbled to his feet and headed straight for his car, opened the door, locked it and started the engine. The wheels screeched and the beast yelled. It was free. Bob began to accelerate with the beast hot on his trail. Never before has anyone set eyes upon something so enraged and angry. The blood had drained from poor Bobs face and a heavy feeling of nausea set in as he sped away from the Gorilla.\n\nSlowly, the enraged beast became a spec in the rear view mirror. A sigh of relief was issued and the blood returned to Bobs face. Finally, it was over. He did it! He went against the signs instruction after so many months and he finally did it! \n\nBack to his commute, the memory of the Gorilla still fresh in his mind, but no longer of concern. Slowly the car halted as Bob abides to the traffic lights. \nBob reached into his pocket and pulled out a pack of Marlboro cigarettes and lit one. Window down, arm out into the bitter cold and the cigarette in hand. Bob turned his head to the vehicle also halted next to his. Fear struck the eyes of Bob. His hands went limp as the cigarette fell landing on the asphalt. The blood had left his face once again as he realised that the Gorilla was sat in the car right next to him. \n\nThere it was, those large hands that clasped the cage now clasped the wheel of the car it was in. The beast had its gaze directed at Bob. It was soul tearing. Bob could feel his eyes burning from the intensity and anger from the Gorillas gaze. \n\nThe wheels screeched. This time not four, but eight wheels as the two began to accelerate. Bob began to ram the side of the Gorillas vehicle to try for an escape as did the Gorilla to Bob for another purpose. Still Bob could feel the burning gaze of the extremely infuriated Gorilla. The lanes began to merge and ahead was a large Truck heading straight down the opposite lane. Bob and the Gorilla began to accelerate for the dominance of the lane. Bob forced his foot deep into his accelerator, forcing his eyes shut and edging ever so slightly past the Gorillas car. \nA large blow from the truck horn then suddenly, CRASH. Bobs eyes began to open. He, had won the lane. The pesky, angry Gorilla was gone, maybe even dead! Finally Bob relaxed again and pulled up to work. \n\nAfter a quick discussion with his Boss as to why he was late, he headed to his office. He sat down and once again, breathed a sigh of relief. Four wheels for four walls. He pushed back into his chair and raised his feet onto his desk.\n\"What a day!\" He exclaimed as he laughed to himself, realising it was barely 10am.\n\nA few hours pass by and Bob gets a call from management to go down to one of the conference rooms to discuss business. He tells them that he'll be down in 5 minutes. Bob gets out of his chair and leaves his office through the door that overlooks all the cubicles on his floor. He takes a quick look around and begins to feel that burn again. That burn he felt a few hours ago at the traffic lights. He scans the top of the cubicles once again, only this time meeting the eyes of a smartly dressed, large, pissed off Gorilla. \n\nThe Gorilla screams a loud and mighty roar and begins to tear down all the cubicles separating him from Bob. Quickly, Bob heads for the elevator and smacks at the button witnessing the destruction left by the Gorilla in a cloud of paper and computer keyboards.\n\nDING!\n\nThe elevator door opens and Bob clambers inside once again frantically hitting the button to close the door. Each and every hit of the button the Gorilla locks in. \nThe doors begin to close, it felt like a lifetime, but eventually they seal. \n\nA sigh of relief, all to familiar today. \n\nBANG\n\n\"THE GODDAMN GORILLA IS ON THE BLOODY ROOF OF THIS ELEVATOR!\"\n\nQuick to think, life or death, Bob clicks the highest floor he can go to, the roof, in hope the elevator crushes the Gorilla. The elevator begins to rise with the Gorilla pounding down with its fists. \n\nDING!\n\nBob runs out onto the roof, the highest floor. Outside and cold with no escape but to jump. All he can do now is hope his plan worked. \nThen one last punch. \n\nBob sees the Gorillas' fist punch through the elevator, covered in blood and metal. Bob falls to his knees with tears in his eyes.\n\"This is it...\" he thought as the Gorilla eventually got out. The Gorilla panting heavily, each breath exaggerated with anger began to walk towards the wailing, crying businessman. Step by step, beg by beg.\n\n\"Please... Please don't kill me, Gorilla!\"\nThe beasts eyes, blood red, forcing into the begging mans eyes and with that, the beast lifted its hands into the air. Clenched and ready to strike. \n\"Please... I'm sorry.\" \nAs quickly as the man begged, the Gorillas right hand began to fall with such speed and force. The man froze, clenching every muscle in his body, ready to be killed, only to open one eye to notice that the Gorillas hand was poised above his shoulder. As his did at the Gas station, the Gorilla extended its index finger and poked hard into the Bobs shoulder. With one last look into the Mans eyes, the Gorilla opened its mouth. The world had froze for Bob. This was it... \n\n\"You're it.\" \n\nAnd off the Gorilla ran. ",

The monks responded saying they couldn't tell him. They could only tell other monks. The hunter then decides to become a monk and after some training and ceremonies he is finally let in. He then asks the monks again and they say they still can't tell him. He has to find out by himself. they then point him in a specific direction and tell him to walk that way and come back when he figures it out.\n\nSo the hunter walked and he walked and he walked and he walked and he walked and he walked and he walked and he walked and he walked and he walked and he walked and he walked and he walked and he walked and he walked and he walked and he walked and he walked until he found a giant metal door.

The wind was gusting, and he was being pelted with bullets of rain. He\nsaw a castle nearby, and knocked on the giant wooden door. He was let in, and met with the king of the castle. He intrigued the king with\nstories of his adventures, and the king made the adventurer feel at home. \"You must be hungry during your journey. I can offer you anything\nyou want from our kitchen. If you can think of anything you would like to eat, my men will make it,\" the king told him. \"There is one thing,\"\nreplied the adventurer, \"I want a pickled onion.\" The king obliged, and the adventurer was given his pickled  onion. The king had also offered\na warm bed for the night, which the adventurer graciously accepted. \n\nThat night, while laying in bed, the king thought to himself, \"That man could have had anything he wanted to eat, yet he chose to have a\npickled onion. How strange. Perhaps I will ask him in the morning why he chose it.\" And he drifted off to sleep. The next morning, when the\nking went to ask the adventurer about his choice in food, he had already left.\n\nA year later, on another stormy night, with winds that bent the thickest of trees, and blinding rain, the adventurer wandered. He could not go\non, and happened to stumble upon the same castle from a year before. He was let in, and greeted by the king once again. \"You must tell me of\nyour adventures from the past year! But first, is there anything you would like to eat from my kitchen? My men can make you anything you want.\nTruly, anything,\" The king insisted. \"There is one thing that I would like,\" replied the adventurer, \"I want a pickled onion.\" Once again, the\nadventurer got what he asked for, and was also given a warm bed for the night.\n\nOnce again, the king thought to himself, \"I offered that man anything, yet once again, he wanted a pickled onion. I will have to ask him first\nthing in the morning why he would want that over anything else.\" After his slumber, the king rose and immediately went to ask the adventurer\nthis burning question. Once again, the adventurer had already gone, and the king was left puzzled.\n\nAnother year passed, and the adventurer found himself in yet another awful storm with bellowing winds and pouring rain. He happened to find himself at the same castle he had taken refuge at 2 times before. He was let in once again, and the king excitedly welcomed him.\n\"It's good to see you again! We must catch up on what has happened since the last time you visited! But first, my men can make you absolutely\nanything you would like from the kitchen.\" Unsurprisingly, the adventurer responded, \"There is one thing that I would like. I want a pickled\nonion.\" The king was ready for that answer, and had one ready for his yearly visitor. \"Before I give you this, I must ask one thing. Every time\nyou come here, I offer you anything you want from my kitchen. Why do you always choose a pickled onion?\" The adventurer replied, \"I will tell\nyou, but you must keep it a secret.\" And the king did.",

He hears the shorter midget call out, \"One, two - hiiiiiiiiighYAH!\", and then he hears the hooker say, \"Oooooh...\" Again, \"One, two - hiiiiiiiiiiighYAH!\", and then the hooker says, \"Ooooooh...\"\n\nThe next morning at breakfast, the shorter midget asks the taller one how his night went, and he says, \"Oh I had too much to drink and couldn't get it up.

And the sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS).\" \n\nAbraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums. And the drums rang out and were an immediate success. Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever moving from his tent. \n\nBut this success did arouse envy. A man named Maccabia did secrete himself inside Abraham's drum and was accused of insider trading. And the young man did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Siderites, or NERDS for short. \n\nAnd lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums that no one noticed that the real riches were going to the drum maker, one Brother William of Gates, who bought up every drum company in the land. And indeed did insist on making drums that would work only with Brother Gates' drumheads and drumsticks. \n\nAnd Dot did say, \"Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others.\" \n\nAnd as Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or as it came to be known \"eBay\" he said, \"We need a name that reflects what we are.\" \n\nAnd Dot replied, \"Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators.\" \n\n\"YAHOO,\" said Abraham. \n\nAnd that is how it all began.

Instead of giving the answer, the teacher split the class into two groups, male and female, and asked them to decide for themselves whether ''computer'' should be a masculine or a feminine noun. Each group was asked to give four reasons for its recommendation. \n\nThe men's group decided that ''computer'' should definitely be of the feminine gender (''la computadora''), because: \n\n1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic.\n2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.\n3. Even the smallest mistakes are stored in long term memory for possible later retrieval.\n4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it. \n\nThe women's group, however, concluded that computers should be Masculine ('el computador''), because: \n\n1. In order to do anything with them, you have to turn them on.\n2. They have a lot of data but still can't think for themselves.\n3. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time they ARE the problem.\n4.

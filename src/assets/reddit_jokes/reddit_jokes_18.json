She hid it up in the attic.'\nSally said, \"Don't listen to him, he's getting senile.'\n\n\nThe agents turn to Andy and began to question him. One says: 'Tell us the story from the beginning' Andy said, 'Well, when Sally and I were walking home from school yesterday . . ..'

He swings on with her to another vine and another, taking her deep into the jungle, far from the trail.\n\nAfter what seems like hours he drops her into a sort nest, high up in a tree, where he brutally has his way with her. Afterwards, he leaves her for the night. Because she is so high up and so shocked she cannot make it down for the tree. \n\nThe gorilla returns the next day with an armload of bananas and melons and other fruits. He then assaults her again, and leaves. This goes on for a number of days.\n\nFinally, one morning, she spots the safari driver and guide searching for her. They find her and manage to get her down. They bundle her out of the jungle and take her to a hospital in a nearby city.\n\nAfter a few days in the hospital and a few weeks of rest at a hotel, she flies back to NYC.\n\nEventually, one Sunday, she meets her friends for brunch. They are all very excited to hear about her trip to Africa. She tells them the whole story, including her abduction by the gorilla. Afterwards, one of her friends says, \"Oh honey! It must have been TERRIBLE for you!\"\n\nShe responds, \"You have no idea... It's been two months now. He doesn't call! He doesn't write!\"",

When the question was asked, the Chinese man thought for a while, then said \"Eleven Thousand.\"\n\n\"Eleven Thousand?!?\" the interviewer asked, surprised. \"Why so much?\"\n\nThe Chinese man leant in close, and whispered:\n\n\"Five thousand for you, five thousand for me, and one thousand to send the Indian into space.\"",

He goes several more blocks and, at another crosswalk, looks behind himself again. This time there are about 30 cats sitting there looking at him. The man starts to get a little nervous and picks up his pace when the light changes.\n\nBy the time the man reaches the pier at the end of the street, he has now been running for several blocks. He was running because every time he turned around, there were more and more cats behind him. He looked like the pied piper. When he got to the end of the pier, he turned around once more and saw at least 10,000 cats sitting there looking at him. There were so many cats that there was no way to get off the pier without going through them and he knew there was no way he was going to do that. In a panic, he turned toward the water and heaved the statue as far as he could. Amazingly, all of the cats ran right past him and jumped in the water after the statue and drowned.\n\nThe man, still shaking from his ordeal, immediately started running back to the shop. As he burst through the door, the shop owner saw him and said \"I told you that you would be back for the story.\" The man replied \"The hell with the story, do you have a statue of a lawyer!\"",

He went to the middle of the town square. As soon as a sizeable crowd had gathered around him, he commanded his mule to show his ability. The mule opened his mouth and let forth a brilliant blue flame. The villagers were shocked at first, but then some of the skeptics chimed in.

Now, I don't just want your mule-dragon to boil them, I want him to melt them into a pool of bean soup!\"\n\nNow, none of the villagers were very smart, so they thought that this was a great idea. Jet obliged. He took his mule to this villager's house. Sure enough, a pot of dry and rock hard beans sat on the counter. Jet commanded his mule to scorch them with all he could muster. The mule let loose an incredible flame, the hottest every made on the earth, but after five minutes of intense hear, the beans didn't change one bit. They stayed just as they were before, dry and hard. Jet was astounded. The villagers all laughed at him for his fake fire-breathing mule.

He orders a beer, and when the bartender places it in his hand says \"Goodness, this is a lot of beer!\" The bartender says, \"Everything's bigger in Texas.\" \n\nAfter a few drinks, he asks the bartender where the bathroom is. \"Down the hall, first door on the left.\" As he is making his way there, he mistakenly takes the second door on the left, which leads to the hotel pool.

He found a dozen lawyers in the main lobby and told them that they were a jury. The lawyers thought this would be a novel experience and so followed the judge back to the courtroom.\n\nThe trial was over in about 10 minutes and it was very clear that the defendant was guilty.

After nearly three hours, the judge was totally out of patience and sent the bailiff into the jury room to see what was holding up the verdict.\n\nWhen the bailiff returned, the judge said, \"Well have they got a verdict yet?\"\nThe bailiff shook his head and said, \"Verdict?

I took a seat and just as he was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. He made me promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned and went to answer the call. The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my husband was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a garbage dump! I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable! Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my husband returned, apologizing for taking so long. He asked me if I had peaked through the blindfold, and I assured him I had not.

So the assistant pastor went down to the shelter with soup and bread. After feeding the people he gave a sermon. Most of the people at the shelter took their food and left, but one woman stayed and listened the entire time. The assistant pastor asked \"What's your name, my dear?\" \"Tootie Greene,\" she replied, \"thank you for the food, but I'm afraid I can't be helped by your words.\" \"Why is that, Tootie?\" \"Well, you see, I got caught up in all kinds of drugs for years. I lost my family over my addictions, sold everything I had, I even sold my body when I was desperate enough.\" The assistant pastor saw that this woman meant well. \"All can be forgiven, my child. Why don't you come to church this Sunday?\" Tootie agreed to come to church that Sunday.\n\nThe assistant pastor went back to the church and told the pastor of his work. \"There's this woman, Tootie Greene, who I met and will be coming to church this Sunday. I must warn you, pastor, she comes from a rough background of drugs and prostitution.\" The pastor acknowledged the fact and prepared for Sunday.\n\nSunday morning comes and the pastor and assistant pastor are standing in the front of the church as the congregation gathers. Suddenly, a woman wearing a short, low-cut dress, high heels, and globs of makeup walks down the aisle and sits front and center, right in front of the pastors. When she sits down she doesn't cross her legs, and spreads them enough that the pastors can see she isn't wearing any underwear. The main pastor turns to the assistant pastor and says, \"Is that Tootie Greene?\" to which the assistant pastor replies \"No sir, I think that's just the way the stained glass is shining on it.\"",

Pete is sitting behind the bar, feeding drinks to one of his daily regulars, when a fresh face walks in.  \n  \nPete had never seen the guy before, but he looked pretty shaken--like he needed a stiff drink.  \n  \nThe man sat down next to Pete's regular customer at the bar, and he saw the regular say to the newcomer, \"Hey, what's wrong?\"  \n  \n\"It's my wife! She cheated on me!\" The man sobs, \"I'm not a drinker, but I'll be damned if I don't down a whole *bottle* of whiskey with you guys tonight.\"  \n  \nPete watches as the look on his regular's face softens. He says, \"Hey, you know what? You don't want to be like us. Alcohol isn't the answer to your problems. What you need is a good cheering up!\"  \n  \nThe newcomer says, \"I don't know mister, I just want to let go and get drunk for once.\"  \n  \nTo that, Pete's regular replies, \"No. No no no, no. I have something that will cheer you up. I promise. You see, there's a window on the top floor of this building with magical properties.\"  \n  \n\"Bull shit,\" the newcomer says.  \n  \nPete is sipping on a seltzer water, listening on.  \n  \n\"I'm serious. I'll prove it. Once you use this window, you'll never worry about that ol' ball and chain again. You'll be free! Hey man, you got nothing to lose, just follow me real quick and I'll show you.  \n  \n\"Well, alright.\" And they walk upstairs.  \n  \nPete is still sitting, daydreaming, sipping his seltzer--meanwhile, the regular and the newcomer are exchanging words upstairs.  \n  \n\"So, all you gotta do is dive out of this window head first, and you'll be granted the gift of flight. And who needs booze when you can *fly*!\"  \n  \n\"You think I'm an idiot?\" The newcomer continues, \"Buzz off, I'll buy myself a bottle at the gas station and drink at home. I'm sick of everyone, damn it!\"  \n  \n\"Not so fast,\" the regular says. \"Let me show you.\"  \n  \nThe newcomer eyes him, tired, and makes his way towards the stairs when--just then--the regular dives head first out the window. The newcomer shouts, \"NO! WAIT!\" and sprints back towards the window, hoping foolishly that he will be able to save Pete's favorite customer. Then, suddenly...  \n  \nThe newcomer gazes in astonishment as the regular falls within feet of the pavement, then rockets back into the sky and pulls a double loop-de-loop. He is floating in the air when he calls to Pete's newcomer, \"See? What did I tell ya! Come on out and be free my new pal!\"  \n  \nWith a rush of excitement and new-found will to live, the newcomer jumps headlong out of the window...  \n  \nBack behind the bar, Pete hears the newcomer's faint scream, then a loud *THUD* outside the front door. Then, his regular comes through the door, straightening his tie and chuckling.  \n  \nPete says, \"Superman, you're an asshole.\"",

The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people. The second kingdom is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power, too. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.\n\nThe kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it\u2019s a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of their finest knights, clad in the best armor and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 of their knights, with fine leather armor and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire.\n\nThe night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and make merry, partying into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren\u2019t as well off, but have their own supply of grog and also drink late into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and slings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight.\n\nThe next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hung over and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old and weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night, but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.\n\n..and it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",

The years pass and 90 grows older, having two children of her own. One day, these two children find a stray dog, and take it home. Knowing that their mother would not approve of them owning a dog, they named the dog \"This\" so she wouldn't know. For example, they would say \"Let's take This outside.\" So 90 would be none the wiser. One day, while the children were playing, they forgot about the dog, and This was run over by a car. (Once again, mexico, crazy shit happens) The children mourned, but no one else had even known the dog had existed. And so...\n\nOnly 90's kids will remember This.\n",

The trouble came when the Captain's talking parrot, after watching the same show time and time again, started to figure the tricks out and then proceed to ruin the shows by shouting out loud things like: - There's a mirror on the side of that box! He's hiding the card up his sleeve!  and so on. The illusionist was outraged but could not do anything to the Capitan's beloved pet.One unfortunate night the ship sunk. All that was left was a lifeboat with the parrot on one end, and the illusionist, on the other end, giving the bird occasional spiteful looks. After two days of drifting, during which the parrot wouldn't take his suspecting look off the angry but exhausted man, the bird finally exclaimed: OK, OK, I GIVE UP !!! WHERE IS THE SHIP ???!!!",

The inevitable happens and when he reached the ghats his Car breaks down - he's stranded miles from nowhere. Having no choice he started walking on the side of the road, hoping to get a lift to the nearest town. It was dark and raining. And pretty soon he got wet and was shivering. The night rolled on and no car passed by, the rain was so heavy he hardly saw a few feet ahead of him.\n\nSuddenly he saw a car coming towards him. It slowed and then stops next to him - without thinking the guy opened the door and jumps in. Seated in the back, he leaned forward to thank the person who had saved him. He realizes there is nobody behind the wheel!!!\n\nEven though there's no one in the front seat and no sound of any engine, the car starts moving slowly. The guy looks at the road ahead and sees a curve coming. Scared almost to death he starts to pray, begging the Lord for his life. He hasn't come out of shock, when just before he hits the curve, a hand appears through the window and moves the wheel! The car makes the curve safely and continues on the road to the next bend. The guy, now paralyzed in terror, watches how the hand appears every time they are before a curve and moves the steering wheel just enough to get the car around each bend.\n\nFinally, the guy sees lights ahead. Gathering his courage he wrenches open the door of the silent, slowly moving car, scrambles out and runs as hard as he can towards the lights. It's a small town.\n\nHe stumbles into a dhaba (a typical highway restaurant in India), and asks for a drink, and breaks down. Then he starts talking about the horrible experience he's just been through.\n\nThere is dead silence in the dhaba when he stops talking...\n\n...and that's when Santa and Banta Singh walk into the dhaba. Santa points and says \"Look Banta - that's the weird guy who got into our car when we were pushing it.",

After a few steps they pause and one sister says \"I feel like we've done wrong, let's at least leave a sign so the poor lad knows we were here.\" They agree this is a good idea and return to the man.

In fact, all the waiters and waitresses have a spoon in their apron pockets. After a few minutes, the waiter returns with his drink and is about to take his order when the man interrupts,\n\n\"What's with the spoons you guys carry around in your aprons?\"\n\nThe waiter replies, \n\n\"Well you see, our restaurant is one of the most efficient restaurants in the state. Statistically, you are ten times more likely to drop your spoon than any other utensil. By carrying one in our apron, we save over 4 hours a week of going to the back for a replacement.\"\n\nThe man, satisfied with the answer, orders a soup and a salad. The waiter returns in no time at all with his soup and salad. As the waiter reaches over to place the food, the man notices something very peculiar. The waiter has a string coming out of his fly. Distracted by this, the man reaches for his spoon only to push it off the table. Statistics prove to be true.\n\nLike a gunslinger, the waiter draws the spare spoon from his hip and gives it to the man. Before he knows it, the waiter is gone.\n\nHalfway through his soup the man gets the waiter's attention after several failed attempts. Discreetly, the man beckons the waiter to come in closer.  The man discreetly alerts the waiter that there is a string stuck in his fly. The waiter then explains,\n\n\"Well you see, I have it there intentionally. Us guys, we attach the strings to our... You know... So that when we use the bathroom we can just simply give it a pull and avoid getting our hands dirty. We have saved over 10 hours a week of unnecessary hand washing!\"\n\nThe man at first satisfied with the answer, puzzlingly asks,\n\n\"Okay so I understand how you get it out, but how do you get it back in?\"\n\n\"I don't know about the other waiters.

This evidently pissed the driver off enough, that he hung out his window and flipped the woman off.\n\n \"Man, that guy is stupid\" I thought to myself I ALWAYS smile wave in a sheepish manner whenever a female does anything to me in traffic and here's why:\n\n I drive 38 miles each way every day to work, that's 76 miles. Of these, 16 each way, is bumper-to-bumper, most of the bumper-to-bumper is on 8 lane highway. So if you just look at the 7 lanes I am not in, that means I pass something like a new car every 40 feet per lane. That's 7 cars every 40 feet for 32 miles. That works out to be 982 cars every mile, or 31,424 cars. Even though the rest of the 34 miles is not bumper to bumper.\n\n I figure I pass at least another 4000 cars. That brings the number to something like 36,000 cars I pass every day.\n\n Statistically half of these are driven by females, that's 18,000.\n\n In any given group of females 1 in 28 are having the worst day of their period. That's 642.\n\n According to Cosmopolitan, 70% describe their love life as dissatisfying or unrewarding, that's 449, according to the National Institutes of Health, 22% of all females have seriously considered suicide or homicide, that's 98, and 34% describe men as their biggest problem, that's 33.\n\n According to the National Rifle Association 5% of all females carry weapons and this number is increasing.\n\n That means that EVERY SINGLE DAY, I drive past at least one female that, has a lousy love life, thinks men are her biggest problem, has seriously considered suicide or homicide, is having the worst day of her period and is ARMED!\n\nNo matter what she does in traffic, I wouldn't DREAM of flipping her off.\n\n",

So he offered him freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult question. Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer; if, after a year, he still had no answer, he would be put to death.\n\nThe question was: What do women really want?\n\nSuch a question would perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and to young Arthur, it seemed an impossible query. Well, since it was better than death, the accepted the monarch's proposition to have an answer by year's end.\n\nHe returned to his kingdom and began to poll everybody: the princess, the prostitutes, the priests, the wise men, the court jester. In all, he spoke with everyone, but no one could give him a satisfactory answer. What most people did tell him was to consult the old witch, as only she would know the answer. The price would be high, since the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged.\n\nThe last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no alternative but to talk to the witch. She agreed to answer his question, but he'd have to accept her price first: The old witch wanted to marry Gawain, the most noble of the Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend! Young Arthur was horrified: she was hunchbacked and awfully hideous, had only one tooth, smelled like sewage water, often made obscene noises...etc ....etc. He\n\nhad never run across such a repugnant creature. He refused to force his friend to marry her and have to endure such a burden.\n\nGawain, upon learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur. He told him that nothing was too big a sacrifice compared to Arthur's life and the preservation of the Round Table. Hence, their wedding was proclaimed, and the witch answered Arthur's question: What a woman really wants is to be able to be in charge of her own life.\n\nEveryone instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and that Arthur's life would be spared.\n\nAnd so it went. The neighboring monarch spared Arthur's life and granted him total freedom. What a wedding Gawain and the witch had! Arthur was torn between relief and anguish. Gawain was proper as always, gentle and courteous. The old witch put her worst manners on display, and generally made everyone very uncomfortable. The wedding night approached: Gawain, steeling himself for an horrific night, entered the bedroom. \n\nWhat a sight awaited! The most beautiful woman he'd ever seen lay before him! Gawain was astounded and asked what had happened. The beauty replied that since he had been so kind to her (when she'd been a witch), half the time she would be her horrible, deformed self, and the other half, she would be her beautiful maiden self. Which would he want her to be during the day, and which during the night?\n\nWhat a cruel question! Gawain began to think of his predicament: During the day, a beautiful woman to show off to his friends, but at night, in the privacy of his home, an old spooky witch? Or would he prefer having by day a hideous witch, but by night a beautiful woman to enjoy many intimate moments?\n\nWhat would you do? What Gawain chose follows below, but don't read until you've made your own choice.\n\nNoble Gawain replied that he would let her choose for herself.\n\nUpon hearing this, she announced that she would be beautiful all the time, because he had respected her and had let her be in charge of her own life.\n\nWhat is the moral of this story? The moral is that it doesn't matter if your woman is pretty or ugly, underneath it all, she's still a witch---and don't you forget it.\n\n",

The coward now has come so far now that he cannot return back so he thought it is better to move forward. Both walk for minutes and suddenly big snakes start crawling. \"Snakes! I'm most scared of snakes\" said the coward. Again, the guide tries to comfort the coward and says \"Don't worry, a bit ahead there are ghost of dead ones. They will kill the snakes.\" The coward asks \" What if the ghosts don't kill the snakes?\". Then, the guide says \"I don't know. I was eaten by snakes a while ago. So..\"   \n ",

He said, \"I would like to have one too!\" Then I said, \"But she is a dog!\" He said he didn't care what she looked like. I said, \"You don't understand... I have had Sex since I was nine years old.\" He replied, \"You must have been quite a strong boy.\"\n\nWhen I decided to get married, I told the minister that I would like to have Sex at the wedding. He told me to wait until after the wedding was over. I said, \"But Sex has played a big part in my life and my whole world revolves around Sex.\" He said he didn't want to hear about my personal life and would not marry us in his church. I told him everyone would enjoy having Sex at the wedding. The next day we were married at the Justice of the Peace. My family is barred from the church from then on.\n\nWhen my wife and I went on our honeymoon, I took the dog with me. When we checked into the motel, I told the clerk that I wanted a room for me and my wife and a special room for Sex. He said that every room in the motel is a place for sex. I said, \"You don't understand. ... Sex keeps me awake at night.\" The clerk said, \"Me too!\"\n\nOne day I entered Sex in a contest. But before the competition began, the dog ran away. Another contestant asked me why I was just looking around. I told him that I was going to have Sex in the contest. He said that I should have sold my own tickets. \"You don't understand,\" I said, \"I hoped to have Sex on TV.\" He called me a show off.\n\nWhen my wife and I separated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. I said, \"Your Honor, I had Sex before I was married but Sex left me after I was married.\" The Judge said, \"Me too!\"\n\nLast night Sex ran off again. I spent hours looking all over for her.

He had scouted all the colleges and even the Canadian and European Leagues, but he couldn't find a ringer who could ensure a Super Bowl win. \n\nThen one night while watching CNN he saw a war-zone scene in the West Bank. In one corner of the background, he spotted a young Israeli soldier with a truly incredible arm. He threw a hand-grenade straight into a 15th story window 100 yards away. KABOOM! He threw another hand-grenade 75 yards away, right into a chimney. KA-BLOOEY! Then he threw another at a passing car going 90 mph. BULLS-EYE! \nI've got to get this guy!\" Coach said to himself. \"He has the perfect Arm!\" \n\nSo, he brings him to the States and teaches him the great game of football. And the Ravens go on to win the Super Bowl. The young man is hailed as the great hero of football, and when the coach asks him what he wants, all the young man wants is to call his Mother. \n\n\"Mom,\" he says into the phone, \"I just won the Super Bowl!\" \"I don't want to talk to you, the old woman says.\" You are not my son!\" \n\n\"I don't think you understand, Mother,\" the young man pleads. \"I've won the greatest sporting event in the world. I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans.\" \n\n\"No! Let me tell you!\" his mother retorts. \"At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us. The neighborhood is a pile of rubble. Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives last week, and I have to keep your sister in the house so she doesn't get raped!\" The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says, \"I will never forgive you for making us move to Baltimore!!!!",

The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. \n\nHe got down on one knee and inspected the elephant's foot and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his hunting knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot. The elephant turned to face the man, and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day. \n\nTwenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man. \n\nRemembering the encounter in 1986, Peter couldn't help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peters legs and slammed his stupid ass against the railing, killing him instantly. \n\nProbably wasn't the same elephant.\n",

We went outside; cleaned up the stairs and driveway, then had a snowball fight (I won). When snow plow passed by we had to re-clean the gate. What a great country. I love Canada.  \nDecember 12,  \nTonight, snow again. Again snow plow passed by and buried gate. Here is so beautiful.  \nDecember 19,  \nTonight, snow again. I could not get the car out to go to work. Here is really wonderful, just a little tired of shoveling. Again f**** snow plow.  \nDecember 22,  \nThis white shit was falling the whole last night.

Mother f***** why don\u2019t they sprinkle more salt on the road so it dissolves faster.  \nDecember 27,  \nTonight, snow again. I have not been out for three days except when I clean the snow after the snow plow passes. I cannot go anywhere, the car got stuck in the mountains, the snow is in front of the gate and it's cold. They say that tonight will get another 30 cm of that shit.  \nDecember 28,  \nThe weather prognosis was bad. It fell half a meter. At this rate it will not melt until summer. The snow plow is stuck and that asshole came to me to ask for a shovel. I told him that I already broke six shovels cleaning that shit from the doorsteps as he tossed it, and I almost broke the shovel on his head.  \nJanuary 4,  \nI am finally out of the house.

A while later the teacher asked April, \"Who is our Lord and Saviour,\" But, April didn't even stir from her slumber. Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again.  \"JESUS CHRIST!\" shouted April and the teacher said, \"very good,\" and April fell back to sleep. Then the teacher asked April a third question.  \"What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?\"  And again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin.  This time April jumped up and shouted, \"IF YOU STICK THAT F*****G THING IN ME ONE MORE TIME, I'LL BREAK IT IN HALF AND STICK IT UP YOUR ARSE!\"\n",

He had just recently watched Rescue Me and new exactly what to do.\n\nKid: \" Well it's a One Alarm fire.\"\n\nThe Operator calms down. She begins to put in the call to the Fire Department.\n\nOperator: \"OK Sweetie, the firefighters will be there soon, just stay away.\"\n\nKid: \"Ok, but now it's a 2 alarm fire.\"\n\nThe Operator freezes. She changes the description of the fire and sends in another fire team.\n\nOperator: \"Alright Sweetie, get inside away from the fire now. Can you do that?\"\n\nKid: \" Yes I can, but now it's a 3 alarm fire!\"\n\nThe Operator panics. She begins to call in the nearest counties department. She screams into the phone. She drops the phone and runs into the bathroom to try and calm down.\n\nThe Fire department arrives in a rush. They look for the dark clouds of the fire. They spot the smoke, but look for me, as the only thing they can see is a small car fire. They search the area looking for any sign of a large fire. They find nothing.\n\nHow could this possibly be a 3 alarm fire they ask?\n\nThey attempt to listen to see if they might hear any screams. The only thing they can hear are 3 car alarms.\n\n",

It catches his attention, so he calls the bartender over and says, \"Hey pal, what up with that jug?\"\n\nThe bartender smiles and says, \"Oh that? That's a prize. There's a horse out back behind the bar. You put 20 bucks into the jar. If you can make the horse laugh, you win the entire contents of the jar.\"\n\nEasy enough, the man says to himself. He takes a 20 out of his wallet, stuffs it into the jar, and heads towards the back door. As he is walking, the bartender calls out, \"Good luck pal. That horse hasn't laughed since he's been here.\" The man shrugs and keeps on walking. The bartender is looking out of the back window as the man leans into the horse and whispers something in the horse's ear. The horse starts laughing uncontrollably. The man smiles, walks back in, finishes his drink, takes the jar of money, and leaves. On his way out, he winks at the bartender.\n\nA few months later, the same man walks into the same bar. He sees another jar full of 20s. He pulls another 20 out and says to the bartender, \"Hey! Do I have to make him laugh again?\" The bartender looks at him questionably and says, \"No. Now you have to make him cry.\" The man smiles, stuffs his 20 into the jar and heads out back. The bartender is looking, again, through the back window. This time, the man didn't whisper anything. He looked at the horse and then looked down. The horse looked at the man, and then looked down as well. Without another moment passing, the horse is a blubbering teary mess, weeping beyond belief. The man walks back into the bar, grabs the jar, winks at the bartender, and heads out.\n\nThe bartender is irate. \"Hold up,\" he yells, \"First, you made the horse laugh when no one else could. Then, you made him cry when no one else could! You have to tell me what you said!\"\n\nThe man stops, and turns around to the bartender, \"Well, first, I had to make him laugh so I told him my dick was bigger then his, and he laughed.

So, much to my mother's dismay, I booked myself a flight and took off alone to meet my culinary destiny.\n\nWhen I arrived in Bruges, I found my way to my hostel, where I met a lovely Norwegian girl who introduced herself as Sieglinde who seemed to share my interest in food, because she kept asking me what my wienerschnitzel was like. She became very excited when I told her it was among the best you could find in the States, but then seemed confused when I told her I prepared it with cajun seasoning, ground pepper, and garlic, and shortly thereafter she politely excused herself. Maybe I should have left the garlic out of it, on reflection, seeing as how she wasn't Italian. Probably just didn't have a taste for the stuff.\n\nAnyway, the next morning I arose early and made my way to Le Nie, where I found myself greeted by a portly, jovial man in a vest, who introduced himself as Rassior don Guerres, the restaurant's maitre d'. I told him my name and said the chef was expecting me, and he smiled and indicated that I proceed to the kitchen, which I did.\n\nI greeted the chef and shook his hand, we discussed the specifics of my apprenticeship, and he introduced me to the other apprentice he had taken on, a beautiful young Argentinian girl who wasted no time once the chef had left earshot in asking me about my burrito. I raised an eyebrow at her and asked her which one she meant, because I can make many different varieties of burritos, and would indeed be willing to do so for a hot tamale like her. She looked at me in befuddlement and then became very interested in her phone. I think I slipped up by forgetting that tamales are not Argentinian and they don't have them in Belgium anyway.\n\nAnyway, we got over our rocky start and quickly became good friends, working under the guidance of Chef Shilo Bouffe (he explained that his father had been French, while his mother was Hebrew), who spent the first few weeks introducing us to the delicate art of making frittes.\n\nHe was very insistent that I needed to include a lot of mayonnaise on my fritte, or else it would not marinate properly and that Belgian quality so inherent to the item would be lost. I took careful heed and always made sure my frittes were covered in a thick layer of delicious mayonnaise.\n\nThis served me well in my first assessment, but it seemed that my Argentinian friend was not so cognizant, or perhaps encountered a language barrier. When her assessment arrived, her fritte didn't have nearly enough mayonnaise on it, and Shilo flipped his lid.\n\n\"What do you call this?\" he barked at her. \"It's all wrong, it's missing all of its character!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she said, tearfully. \"What did I forget?\"\n\n\"Ayy!\" he said, angrily. \"Le mayo!\"\n\n^^^I ^^^am ^^^so ^^^sorry",

No hogs to slop, feed to pitch, mash to mix, wood to split, fire to lay. Practically nothing. Men got to shave but it is not so bad, there's warm water. \n\nBreakfast is strong on trimmings like fruit juice, cereal, eggs, bacon,etc.,but kind of weak on chops, potatoes, ham, steak, fried eggplant, pie and other regular food. But tell Walt and Elmer you can always sit by the two city boys that live on coffee. Their food plus yours holds you till noon when you get fed again. It's no wonder these city boys can't walk much. \n\nWe go on \"route\" marches, which the Platoon Sergeant says are long walks to harden us. If he thinks so, it is not my place to tell him different. A \"route march\" is about as far as to our mailbox at home. Then the city guys get sore feet and we all ride back in trucks. The country is nice, but awful flat. \n\nThe Sergeant is like a schoolteacher. He nags some. The Capt. is like the school board. Majors and Colonels just ride around and frown. They don't bother you none. This next will kill Walt and Elmer with laughing. I keep getting medals for shooting. I don't know why. The bulls-eye is near as big as a chipmunk head and don't move. And it ain't shooting at you, like the Higgett boys at home. All you got to do is lie there all comfortable and hit it. You don't even load your own cartridges. They come in boxes. \n\nThen we have what they call hand-to-hand combat training. You get to wrestle with them city boys. I have to be real careful though, they break real easy. It ain't like fighting with that ole bull at home. I'm about the best they got in this except for that Tug Jordan from over in Silver Lake. He joined up the same time as me. But I'm only 5'6\" and 130 pounds and he's 6'8\" and weighs near 300 pounds dry. \n\n\nBe sure to tell Walt and Elmer to hurry and join before other fellers get onto this setup and come stampeding in. \n\nYour loving daughter, Gail \n\n",

Discussion ensues and finally the couples decide to swap partners for the night and experience one another. Maureen and the male Martian go off to a bedroom where the Martian strips. He's got only a teeny, weeny member about half an inch long and just a quarter inch thick. I don't think this is going to work,\" says Maureen. \"Why?\" he asks, \"What's the matter?\" \"Well,\" she replies, \"It's just not long enough to reach me!\" \"No problem,\" he says, and proceeds to slap his forehead with his palm. With each slap of his forehead,  his member grows until it's quite impressively long. \"Well,\" she says, \"That's quite impressive, but it's still pretty narrow....\" \"No problem,\" he says, and starts pulling his ears. With each pull,his member grows wider and wider until  the entire measurement is extremely exciting to the woman. \"Wow!\" she exclaims, as they fell into bed and made mad, passionate love. The next day the couples rejoin their normal partners and go their separate ways. As they walk along, Mike asks \"Well, was it any good?\" \"I hate to say it,\" says Maureen, \"but it was pretty wonderful. How about you?\" \"It was horrible,\" he replies, All I got was a headache.

        "body": "I went grocery shopping recently while not being altogether sure that said course of action was a wise one. You see, the previous evening I had prepared and consumed a massive quantity of my patented 'Killer Chili'. Tasty stuff, albeit hot to the point of being painful, which comes with a written guarantee from me that if you eat the next day both of your butt cheeks WILL fall off.\n\n Here's the thing. I had awakened that morning, and even after two cups of coffee (and all of you know what I mean) nothing happened. No 'Watson's Movement 2'. Despite habanera peppers swimming their way through my intestinal tract, I appeared to be unable to create the usual morning symphony referred to by my next door neighbors as thunder and lightning.\n\n Knowing that a time of reckoning had to come, yet not sure of when, I bravely set off for the market; a local Wal-Mart grocery store that I often haunt in search of tasty tidbits.\n\n Upon entering the store at first all seemed normal. I selected a cart and began pushing it about dropping items in for purchase. It wasn't until I was at the opposite end of the store from the restrooms that the pain hit me. Oh, don't look at me like you don't know what I'm talking about. I'm referring to that 'Uh oh, gotta go' pain that always seems to hit us at the wrong time. The thing is, this pain was different.\n\n The habaneras in the chili from the night before were staging a revolt. In a mad rush for freedom they bullied their way through the small intestines, forcing their way into the large intestines, and before I could take one step in the direction of the restrooms which would bring sweet relief, it happened. The peppers fired a warning shot.\n\n There I stood, alone in the spice and baking aisle, suddenly enveloped in a noxious cloud the likes of which has never before been recorded. I was afraid to move for fear that more of this vile odor might escape me. Slowly, oh so slowly, the pressure seemed to leave the lower part of my body, and I began to move up the aisle and out of it, just as an elderly woman turned into it.\n\n I don't know what made me do it, but I stopped to see what her reaction would be to the malodorous effluvium that refused to dissipate, as she walked into it unsuspecting. Have you ever been torn in two different directions emotionally? Here's what I mean, and I'm sure some of you at least will be able to relate.\n\n I could've warned that poor woman but didn't. I simply watched as she walked into an invisible, and apparently indestructible, wall of odor so terrible that all she could do before gathering her senses and running, was to stand there blinking and waving her arms about her head as though trying to ward off angry bees. This, of course, made me feel terrible, but then made me laugh. Big Mistake.\n\n Here's the thing. When you laugh, it's hard to keep things 'clamped down', if you know what I mean. With each new guffaw an explosive issue burst forth from my nether region. Some were so loud and echoing that I was later told a few folks in other aisles had ducked, fearing that someone was robbing the store and firing off a shotgun.\n\n Suddenly things were no longer funny. IT was coming, and I raced off through the store towards the restrooms, laying down a cloud the whole way, praying that I'd make it before the grand mal assplosion took place.\n\n Luck was on my side. Just in the nick of time I got to the john, began the inevitable 'Oh my God', floating above the toilet seat because my butt is burning SO BAD, purging. One poor fellow walked in while I was in the middle of what is the true meaning of 'Shock and Awe'. He made a gagging sound, and disgustedly said, ' Oh my Lord', then quickly left.\n\n Once finished I left the restroom, reacquired my partially filled cart intending to carry on with my shopping when a store employee approached me and said, 'Sir, you might want to step outside for a few minutes. It appears some prankster set off a stink bomb in the store. The manager is going to run the vent fans on high for a minute or two which ought to take care of the problem.'\n\n That of course set me off again, causing residual gases to escape me. The employee took one sniff, jumped back pulling his shirt up to cover his nose and, pointing at me in an accusing manner shouted, 'IT'S YOU!', then ran off returning moments later with the manager. I was unceremoniously escorted from the premises and asked none too kindly not to return.\n\n Home again without having shopped, I realized that there was nothing to eat but leftover chili, so I consumed two more bowls. The next day I went to shop at Food Town. I can't say anymore about that because we are in court over the whole matter. They claim they're going to have to repaint the store. ",

There is a lot of screaming and shouting inside, along with breaking furniture and shattering crockery. Worst off all, it seems to be coming from two very distinctly different voices. \n\n\nConcerned, Rabbit looks to those around him and asks, \u201cWill anybody go inside and see what all that noise is about?\u201d Tigger immediately throws up a paw and bounds through the door before another word is said. When he comes out, he\u2019s very, very pale. Rabbit asks him what he saw. He won\u2019t answer. Instead, he sits on a log and stares ahead, eyes focused somewhere miles away.\n\n\nRabbit asks again if anyone is willing to see what\u2019s going on in there, as the shouting still hasn\u2019t stopped yet. If anything, it\u2019s gotten even louder. Nervously, Piglet offers up a hand and creeps through the door. When he comes back, he\u2019s also gone very pale and sits down beside Tigger before breaking out into inconsolable tears. All that can be made out through his sobbing is the words \u201cChristopher Robin\u201d. Rabbit, sweating bullets, asks if anyone else would like to try. The screaming in the house is building to a very definite crescendo now. With a sigh, Eeyore stands up and shuffles morosely inside. \n\n\nA few seconds later, the screaming has stopped. The silence is almost deafening. Rabbit is about to ask again if anyone will look inside, when the door opens and Eeyore walks out, none the worse for wear except for a stench wafting off him that Rabbit cannot place. Eeyore walks over to the log and sits on it, nibbling on a stalk of grass as he chuckles softly to himself. \n\n\nRabbit, extremely disturbed, sidles as close as the horrible odor wafting off Eeyore will allow and asks, \u201cIs everyone alright? What was that about?\u201d\n\n\nEeyore chuckles again, chews the blade of grass thoughtfully a couple moments longer, then says, \u201cYeah, everyone\u2019s fine.\u201d He glances at his two neighbors, still emotionally shattered, and snorts. \u201cDon\u2019t see what all the fuss was about.

They heard a huge voice booming out of no where, \"THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THE ICE.\"  They're a little discomfited, but seeing no one around, they set up and start drilling.  Again, the voice, \"THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THE ICE.\"  This time they can't take it any more, and one of them screams \"WHO WAS THAT?\"  The booming voice replies, \"THIS IS THE MANAGEMENT OF CHAPARRAL ICE RINKS, AND THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THE ICE.\"\n\nSince ice fishing wasn't working out, they went hunting, and promptly got lost.  One of them says, \"WAIT, I heard that if you fire a shot off into the air, someone will hear and come find you.\"  So they tried that.  And tried it again later.  Eventually the other one says, \"I'm not sure about this.  I'm running out of arrows.\"\n\nEventually, one of the aggies got the idea that he could just use a map and a compass to find their way out.  His friend says, \"Wait, you've had that the whole time?\"  So he sat down on the ground and studied the map for a solid 15 minutes, studied the compass and then studied  the map some more.  Finally, he jumped up and shouted, \"GOT IT!\"  His friend said, \"GREAT!  Where are we?\"  He said, \"See that tall tree sticking up from the top of that hill?\"  His friend said, \"I sure do!\"  And he replied, \"We're at the top of it!\"\n\nFortunately, our two Aggies eventually stumbled across some tracks, and since they were getting awful hungry, they followed them hoping to find some food.  Sadly, the train killed them.\n\n---\n\"Aggies\" in this context are the intelligent, educated people of Texas A&M University.

I felt frustrated so i recall going inside where grandma tried to cheer me up,As grand mas do.\nShe made a fresh tray of cookies and MAN, they were delicious. \nJust as they came out of the oven Grand pa came waltzing in from the lawn. \n\"Wow\", he exclaimed to me \" did grand ma make you those cookies?\"\n\"she sure did\" i said proudly.\n\"Well do you think you grand pa could have one?\" he asked confidently.\nI said, \"well grand pa, you seem old enough but can your pee pee touch your butt?\" \n\"im 72, of course it can little buddy\" he said with a chuckle.\n\"good, then go fuck yourself because these are my cookies bitch\"!",

He drove the old mule into the shade, sat down on a stump, and began to eat his lunch. Immediately, his wife began haranguing him again.

Killed her dead on the spot.\nAt the funeral several days later, the minister noticed something rather odd. When a woman mourner would approach the old farmer, he would listen for a minute, then nod his head in agreement; but when a man mourner approached him, he would listen for a minute, then shake his head in disagreement. This was so consistent, the minister decided to ask the old farmer about it.\nSo after the funeral, the minister spoke to the old farmer, and asked him why he nodded his head and agreed with the women, but always shook his head and disagreed with all the men. The old farmer said: \"Well, the women would come up and say something about how nice my wife looked, or how pretty her dress was, so I'd nod my head in agreement.\"\n\"And what about the men?\" the minister asked. \"They wanted to know if the mule was for sale.\"",

The lawyer noticed them in time to run for cover. His friend, however, was not so lucky. The male bear reached him and swallowed him whole. \n\nSeeing this, the lawyer ran to his Mercedes and sped for the nearest town to get the local sheriff. The sheriff grabbed a high-powered rifle and they raced back to the berry patch. Luckily, the bears were still there. \n\n\"He's in THAT one!\" cried the lawyer, pointing at the bear that had consumed his friend. \"Quick -- shoot it. Maybe we can still save my friend!\" \n\nThe sheriff looked at the bears, leveled his gun, took careful aim, and shot the female. His aim was true, and the female bear collapsed to the ground. The startled male fled into the woods. \n\n\"Why did you do that?\" demanded the lawyer, \"I said he was in the other bear!\" \n\n\"Exactly,\" replied the sheriff. \"Would you believe a lawyer who told you that the Czech was in the male?\n",

As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: \"Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle.\"\n\nIn a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end.

The second day, he does the same thing. This goes on all semester, until he gets his first report card. All A+ grades, even in math!\nThe parents are delighted, but curious. They ask their son, \"What did this school do differently, that finally helped you learn math?\"\n\"Well,\" the son replied, \"I walked in the first day and saw that a hindu guy nailed to the plus sign, and I knew these people meant business!\"",

        "body": "Three friends grew up together in Seattle their names were Mike, Steve, and Davonte. As children the boys had an odd friend in the homeless gentleman that lived in there neighborhood. They used to tell their parents they were going to an arcade, and head down to the park instead. There they would give thean some change and he would tell them stories about \"The cave of dreams\" and it's endless treasure.\n\n   When it came time for the boys to venture out into the world they made one last trip to the park to see their old friend. There they discovered his body laying peacefully in the grass. His spirit having left in his sleep. Next to his body was an old decrepit piece of parchment Steve picked it up for examination. It was a map which revealed that the fabled cave of dreams was in right there in Seattle hidden in plain sight. The three wanting to honor their departed friend (and more than a little curious about the treasure) decided to enter the cave.\n\n   After making the trek, they dove into a lake bags in tow with which to carry their riches. The enter the cave they had to dive into a lake and swim down a passage in it'so bed. On the other end of the passage they emerged to a dark damp underground cave with three paths. Mike took the path on the left Steve took the middle path and Davonte took the path on the right.\n\n   As Mike walked down his path he noticed standing water getting progressively deeper the further he walked and he was amazed by how long the path was he had been walking for nearly half an hour and decided to take a break when he leaned up against the wall and realized there was water running down the wall the entire length of the path. He thought this was odd but continued walking thoughts of endless wealth pushing him forward. When he finally got to the end of the path the water was up to his neck. There was a door and on the door was a sign, it read \"Beyond this door lies a vast treasure but any who enter will meet a horrible demise\". Never the overly cautious type Mike opened the door and found a room the size of a theater filled with more treasure than you could imagine gold, jewels, ancient artifacts the whole shabang. The water rushed through the doorway but seemed to drain somehow into the floor if the treasure room. Mike stuffed his bag and pocket with as much treasure as he could carry and discovered an exit at the back of the room.\n\n   Steve who took the middle path walked down the path and as he got further down he noticed it getting hotter and hotter. Before too long he had to rest and he went to lean up against the wall but immediately yanked his hand back for the wall was hot like a pan just off the stove. By the time he got to the end of the path it was so hot he could hardly breath. There was an identical door to the one Mike came across but Steve too ignored the cryptic message and entered the next room. Relief washed over him as the cool air from the treasure room overpowered the heat. He gathered as much treasure as he could and exited through the back.\n\n   Now all that remained was Davonte he noticed that the floor to his path was slippery and he felt strange occasional tremors in the ground but thought nothing of it and continued down the path. Like his friendson Davonte eventually had to rest and went to lean against the wall the wall too was slippery and he realized the tremors he had been experiencing were caused by the surrounding corridor pulsating like it was a living thing. Davonte was scared but the promise of treasure kept him going until he too came to an identical door with the same sign. He passed through it cautiously on the other side was a similar treasure to what his friends found and after gathering all he could he exited through the back, there he found his friends waiting they told each other all about their adventures on the way back into town.\n\n   As the years went by the friends branched off and began to live their own lives. Exactly five years later they were all quite successful the treasure was worth more than the had ever imagined each piece being nearly priceless. Mike was out on his yacht with his third supermodel wife when he went inside to use the rest room. After doing his business he turned n the faucet to was his hands but the moment his skin made contact with the water he evaporated, vanished in thin air. It was assumed his wife pushed him over the edge in hopes of obtaining his wealth, and though saddened by news of their friends demise Steve an Davonte failed to make the connection between it and the cave of dreams.\n\n   Another five years pass and Steve is close to bankruptcy. He had managed to squander almost all of his wealth living a lifestyle that an emperor could only describe as lavish and overly self-indulgent. Depressed he had turned to drugs and spiraled downwards to more and more dangerous substances. He ran a spoonful of heroin over a flame so that he could inject it into his arm. For just a moment the flame came in contact with his skin and when it did he evaporated into thin air. A search team was formed but Steve was of course never found. Everyone assumed a drug deal had gone bad and that Steve was at the bottom of the ocean somewhere, everyone except Davonte.\n\n   While his friends wasted their money partying, Davonte was building an empire. He made the connection that both of his friend died on the same day and then that it was the day they visited the cave. He didn't know what it was but he knew that there was some force at work, and that the sign on the door had been true, most importantly though he knew he had five years and he wasn't going down without a fight.\n\n   Using his vast wealth he began construction on a fortress strong enough to withstand any attack and had his living quarters placed in the center with layers of protection on all sides. He bought out private military corporations and built a private army that rivaled many countries in strength. When the day finally arrived he sat nervously in his room his entire army spread throughout. With orders to report any strange activity. Sure enough a strange geometrical shape appeared on the radar traveling towards the fortress at incredible speeds. When it came in contact with the outer wall it broke through without taking a scratch. It slowed down significantly and started creeping through the fortress Davontes soldiers showered it with ammunition an explosives but nothing seemed to affect it it broke through wall after wall until it came to the innermost layer where Steve waited  with his 10 best men. The object was dark brown and floated through the air directly toward Davonte unaffected by the soldiers efforts to stop it. Davonte was terrified he ran into the bathroom and slammed the door but of course the object busted right through. Davonte could now clearly see the object was a box or a coffin to be exact if he hadnt been so scared he may have laughed, his own coff in was coming to kI'll hin. He knew then that it was over but still he weakly struggled against it. He ripped the curtain rod off the shower and threw it at the coffin. He started yelling at it and throwing anything he could at it a scented candle, tylenol, soap, shampoo. When it was only feet away and still creeping forward he grabbed the last thing near him a pack of Vick's Cold and Flu and threw it. The coffin stopped. Davonte let out a nervous laugh, he'd done it he'd cheated the prophecy and survived. He built a family and lived a long joy filled life never once taking any of it for granted, knowing how lucky he was to be alive.\n\nThat may seem like the moral of the story, love life you never know when it'll end, but it isn't. The actual moral of the story is that VICK'S. WILL. STOP. YOUR. COFFIN.",

As he did so he noticed another note on it that read *\"Chinese Torture Number 2: Rock tied to left testicle.\"* In a panic he glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut.

About a half hour later, the man approaches the women and says, 'I like to buy two drink more for you ladies.'\n\nThe women both reply, 'It won't do you any good.' The foreign man says, 'Me not understand. What you mean 'won't do me any good'?' The first woman says, 'We're lesbians.' To which the foreign man asks, 'Lesbians? What is a lesbians?' To which the second woman replies, 'Lesbians! we like to lick pussy.'\n\nThe foreign man yells, 'Bartender, three beers for us lesbians.'",

One to eat it, and two to watch for traffic.\n\nTwo Aggies went ice fishing, but it was kind of a bust.  Spent all weekend just clearing enough ice to get the boat in the water.\n\nSomeone was kind enough to explain to them how you ice fish.  So they went to a new spot (too ashamed to go to the old one.)  They took out their drill to cut through the ice.  They heard a huge voice booming out of no where, \"THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THE ICE.\"  They're a little discomfited, but seeing no one around, they set up and start drilling.  Again, the voice, \"THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THE ICE.\"  This time they can't take it any more, and one of them screams \"WHO WAS THAT?\"  The booming voice replies, \"THIS IS THE MANAGEMENT OF CHAPARRAL ICE RINKS, AND THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THE ICE.\"\n\nSince ice fishing wasn't working out, they went hunting, and promptly got lost.  One of them says, \"WAIT, I heard that if you fire a shot off into the air, someone will hear and come find you.\"  So they tried that.  And tried it again later.  Eventually the other one says, \"I'm not sure about this.  I'm running out of arrows.\"\n\nEventually, one of the aggies got the idea that he could just use a map and a compass to find their way out.  His friend says, \"Wait, you've had that the whole time?\"  So he sat down on the ground and studied the map for a solid 15 minutes, studied the compass and then studied  the map some more.  Finally, he jumped up and shouted, \"GOT IT!\"  His friend said, \"GREAT!  Where are we?\"  He said, \"See that tall tree sticking up from the top of that hill?\"  His friend said, \"I sure do!\"  And he replied, \"We're at the top of it!\"\n\nFortunately, our two Aggies eventually stumbled across some tracks, and since they were getting awful hungry, they followed them hoping to find some food.  Sadly, the train killed them.\n",

And Satan said, \"You want chocolate with that?\" And Man said \"Yes!\" and Woman said, \"and as long as you're at it, ad some sprinkles!\" And they gained 10 pounds and Satan smiled. \n\nAnd God created the healthful yogurt that Woman might keep the figure that Man found so fair. And Satan brought forth white flour from the wheat, and sugar from the cane and combined them. And woman went from size 6 to size 14.\n\nSo God said, \"Try my fresh green salad.\" And Satan presented Thousand-Island Dressing, buttery croutons, and garlic toast on the side. And Man and Woman unfastened their belts following the repast.\n\nGod then said, \"I have sent you heart healthy vegetables and olive oil in which to cook them. And Satan brought forth deep fried fish and chicken-fried steak so big it needed its own platter. And Man gained more weight and his cholesterol went through the roof.\n\nGod then created a light, fluffy white cake, named it \"Angel Food Cake,\" and said, \"It is good.\" Satan then created chocolate cake and named it \"Devil's Food.\"\n\nGod then brought forth running shoes so that His children might lose those extra pounds. And Satan gave cable TV with a remote control so Man would not have to toil changing the channels. And Man and Woman laughed and cried before flickering blue light and gained pounds.\n\nGod then gave lean beef so that Man might consume fewer calories and still satisfy his appetite. And Satan created McDonald's and its 99-cent double cheeseburger. Then said, \"You want fries with that?\" And Man replied \"Yes!\" and Satan said, \"It is good.\" And Man went into cardiac arrest.\n\nGod sighed and created quadruple bypass surgery.\n\nThen Satan created HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations).\n\nThought for the day...\n\nThere is more money being spent on breast implants and Viagra today than on Alzheimer's research.

Just then the Leprechaun stirred and then sat up. \"Weel ya got me!\" slurred the Leprechaun. Colm, not knowing what to do or say just stared blankly, mouth agape. \"I see  tha cat has got your tongue.\" said the Leprechaun smiling. \"You foyn sir are due three wishes.\" This was more than poor Colm could take. So he ran (golf clubs in tow) for the club house. \n\nThe perplexed Leprechaun decided that rules were rules and that he would grant the three wishes in the golfer's stead. The three wishes he granted were. 1) The golfer would always have great rounds of golf. 2) The golfer would never want for money. 3)  From here on out, the golfer would have the best sex of his life.\n\nOne year later Colm was golfing the same course and on the third hole, at the same bunker, the Leprechaun materialized. The Leprechaun asked a startled Colm how his year had been. \"This year has been amazing\" said Colm. \"I've golfed twice a week and birdied every hole!\" He continued, \"Amazingly, every time I went to the pub for a pint a new 20 pound note was in my wallet. And, I had great sex once  a month.\" The confused Leprechaun asked, \"sex only once per month?\" Colm replied, \"yeah, but  that's not too bad for priest with a small parrish.\"\n\n...I heard that last night at the course.

One day, I just work up all the confidence I can and I ask her out as I'm taking out some money.\nShe said yes! So we set up a time around the weekend for me to come over and pick her up. She gives me her number, I get her address, and I skip home (not literally, but you know) as happy as can be. So it's the weekend, and I drive up to her house in my little beat up honda.\nI knock on her door and her dad answers. A split second of \"oh shit\" comes over me, but he just gives me this heartwarming smile and invites me into this house. I instantly feel at ease and we go sit down in the living room. Her dad is all happy like \"i'm so glad you're taking my daughter out\" and \"i really really appreciate it\" and all this crazyness. So i'm starting to think to myself \"uh oh what have i gotten myself into\"\nSo her dad reaches into his pocket and pulls out a set of car keys. He says \"I want you to take my car.\" I said \"No thats okay I have my car\"\nHe's all like \"no no no\" practically forcing the keys into my hand. Still keeping his big smile on his face. No sooner does he give me the keys than do I hear from up the stairs \"BZZZZZZZZZZ\"\nNo shit, she's in a wheelchair! A split second of shallow human being comes over me, but I think about it and say to myself \" I can do this! She's awesome and has a great personality, fuck it!\"\nWe go outside, and I realize why her dad wanted me to take his truck. It was all rigged up with the belts and harnesses and the door that came all the way out for the wheelchair. So I took his truck, and we head to the movies. Best part? The handicap spot!\nSo we're in the theater, and no sooner does the movie start, than she starts putting her hands on my junk! She's a freak! That's totally cool with me! We start making out almost during the whole movie.\nMy parents are out of town that weekend, so I ask her if she wants to come back to my place. She says Yes so we get back in her dads truck and we're on the way to my house.\nWe arrive at my house, I have stairs, so I have to carry her inside. Thankfully my room is on the first floor.

By choosing white you get a \u201clikely to be well received by strangers\u201d bonus; random encounters will have a 25% greater chance of yielding favorable results (unless you're in bizarro world, aka gangland, where all stats have the opposite effect and are twice as powerful).\n\nThe only time I doubt the power of whiteness  to work in my favor is when I abruptly have to hide outside at night. My skin is one shade off from reflective; I was never very good at manhunt. But I'm an adult now and I need no longer evade members of my peer group pursuing me on foot. At this age and skin color, the authority in my world is mostly stationary. It's like vegetation that  you walk around. Police officers are poison ivy. White people have to grab them with their bare hands before there's any lasting repercussion. \n\nThe one thing white people have to fear from cops is the taser, but what actually scares them isn't being tasered; it\u2019s watching a viral video of yourself being tasered (convulsing and diarrhea-ing as you clutch your shoplifted Keurig). \n\nWhite people aren't afraid of getting shot by cops because we know cops would rather not shoot us. Every time a cop has shot a white person it's because he accidentally drew his gun instead of his taser. Granted, cops did intentionally use guns on white people before the invention of tasers, but only while wishing that something like tasers existed, primarily because shooting white people carries things like consequences (good to have around when you'd rather not get murdered).\n",

This is not a case of twisting, but of the refined manner of presentation by witty minds. A good case for reference.\n\nOne evening, after attending the theatre, two gentlemen were walking down the avenue when they observed a rather well dressed and attractive young lady walking ahead of them. One of them turned to the other and remarked, \"I'd give $250 to spend the night with that woman.\"\n\nMuch to their surprise, the young lady overheard their remark, turned around, and replied, \"I'll take you up on that offer.\"\n\nShe had a neat appearance and a pleasant voice, so after bidding his companion good night, the man accompanied the young lady to her apartment. The following morning, as he prepared to leave, the man gave her $125.\n\nShe demanded the rest of the money, stating, \"If you don't give me the other $125 I'll sue you for it.\"\n\nHe laughed, saying \"I'd like to see you get it on these grounds.\"\n\nWithin a few days, he was surprised when he received a summons ordering his presence in court as a defendant in a lawsuit. He hurried to his lawyer and explained the details of the case. His lawyer said, \"She can't possibly get a judgment against you on such grounds, but it will be interesting to see how her case will be presented.\"\n\nAfter the usual preliminaries, the lady's Lawyer addressed the court as follows:\n\"Your Honour, my client, this lady, is the owner of a piece of property, a garden spot, surrounded by a profuse growth of shrubbery, which property she agreed to rent to the defendant for a specified length of time for the sum of $250. The defendant took possession of the property, used it extensively for the purposes for which it was rented, but upon evacuating the premises, he paid only $125, one-half of the amount agreed upon. The rent was not excessive, since it is restricted property, and we ask judgment be granted against the defendant to assure payment of the balance.\"\n\nThe defendant's Lawyer was not only surprised but also impressed AND amused by the way his opponent had presented the case. Naturally, his defence was somewhat different from the way he had originally planned to present it. He rose to the occasion!\n\n'Your Honour,\" he said, \"my client agrees that the lady has a fine piece of property, that he did rent such property for a time, and a degree of pleasure was derived from the transaction. However, my client found a well on the property around which he placed his own stones, sunk a shaft, and erected a pump, all labor performed personally by him. We claim these improvements to the property were sufficient to offset the unpaid amount, and that the plaintiff was adequately compensated for the rental of said property. We, therefore, ask that judgment not be granted.\"\n\nThe young lady's lawyer answered, \"Your Honour, my client agrees that the defendant did find a well on her property. However, had the defendant not known that the well existed, he would never have rented the property. Also, upon evacuating the premises, the defendant removed the stones, pulled out the shaft, and took the pump with him. In doing so, he not only dragged the equipment through the shrubbery, but left the hole much larger than it was prior to his occupancy, making the property much less desirable to others. We, therefore, ask that judgment be granted.\"\n\nIn the Judge's decision, he provided for two options, \"Pay the balance $125 to the plaintiff, or have the equipment detached from its current location and provided to the plaintiff for damages.\"\n\nThe defendant wrote out a cheque immediately.",

Their kind isn't supposed to be allowed in...\"\n\nHis musings were cut off by one of the girls, who said, \"Hi, I hear you're new here. We try to give everyone a nice welcome, so you get all six of us. You want to go upstairs?\"\n\n\"Why?\" the Republican asked. \"Is O'Reilly playing on a TV there?\"\n\nThe girl giggled, then said, \"No, we were going to play.\"\n\n\"Bingo?\" the Republican inquired, excited. \"Great, I'm a master at G52!\"\n\n\"No,\" the girl responded, giggling again. \"we had something better in mind. Actually, you can have me first, all three ways.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" the Republican responded, confused, \"so we'll do regular Bingo, then corners, and postage stamp?\"\n\nThe girl, now very amused, contined, \"Actually, we can...\" then leaned over and whispered in his ear.\n\nThe Republican yelped, and then ran into the bathroom, where he locked the door and crouched down by the toilet, in tears.\n\nAfter an hour, he managed to crawl up, where he saw some dispensers on the wall.\n\n\"Why, these are those sin balloons,\" he noted, before picking up a bottle next to the sink and wondering, \"and what is this odd, gooey substance?\"\n\nEventually, the night passed, and he heard a knocking on the door.\n\"Are you okay in there?\" called Peter. \"Because it's time for you to make your decision...\"\n\nThe Republican senator cautiously opened the door, and peered around to make sure the girls were gone.\n\n\"You've experienced a day in Heaven and a day in Hell,\" Peter noted. \"So where would you like to spend eternity?\"\n\n\"I can't believe I'm saying this after all I'd heard on Earth,\" the Republican replied, \"but I much preferred the other place... you know, H-E-double hockey sticks. I'd like to go there.\"\n\n\"Sure thing, Republican,\" Peter responds while reaching for a lever, \"go to Hell.\"\n\nBefore he knows it, the Republican senator is back on the escalator, heading down.\n\n\"Fine and dandy,\" notes the Republican as the double doors open.\n\nHe walks out and finds himself in a barren land, covered with garbage and with flames occasionally bursting from the ground.\n\nHis friends are in rags, picking up endless streams of trash and getting poked with pitchforks, as they move along a floor of hot coals.\n\nThe devil appears and the senator approaches him.\n\n\"I don't get it,\" cries the Republican. \"Yesterday I played golf and drank champagne. My friends had fancy clothing and the land was picturesque. \n\nThis place looks painful, and everyone looks miserable. \nWhat happened?\" \n.\n.\n.\nGrinning, the devil replies, \"Yesterday we were campaigning. Today you voted.\"",

And then, naturally, there were the volunteers.  \n\n\nMany of the volunteers were quite popular with the scientists, but chief amongst them was Benny.  Benny was the picture of human health, over 6 feet tall and in great shape due to the rigorous exercise regimen set for the subjects.  As expected, Benny becomes the first human to be cloned en masse, owing to his impressive physical abilities.  \n\n\nThe cloning process goes beautifully, with the facility now churning out dozens of new Bennies.  However, there was one oddity that was observed.  Every cloned Benny had experienced a pronounced growth in body hair, enough to make each Benny appear more like Bigfoot than Adonis.  \n\n\n Curious, the scientists decided to take a random Benny from the barch of clones and shave all of his hair off.  They dosed the Benny and put him under, restraining him and systematically shaving off the body hair that covered every inch of skin.  Before long, they had completed their work, and sat back to watch in amazement the physical perfection that the Benny had hidden beneath so much hair.  \n\n\nAt that moment, the heart monitor starts to beep frantically, eventually emitting a continual tone as the Benny's heart stopped.  Somehow, shaving a Benny resulted in his death.  Devastated, the scientists  solemnly bring the Benny to the crematorium on-site.  There is a quick service, a moment of silence, and a goodbye to the unfortunate Benny.  His body is then burned, leaving behind only some ash, given back to the scientists in an urn.  This happens a few more times, each experiement ending in failure, with no further understanding of the relationship between the Bennies and their hair.  Soon, unable to take the grief, the scientists decide to halt the research into the Bennies' hair.  \n\n\n\nEventually, the director of the facility comes by the lab, and asks the chief scientist whether they would be continuing with the research into the cause of the overgrown body hair on the Bennies.  The scientist, outraged and in mourning, grasps a jar full of a Benny's ashes and answered,      \n\n\n\n\"No sir, I believe at this point it is clear that a Benny shaved is a Benny urned.\"  ",

He'd lived his life in the \"right way,\" whatever that means.  He went to school, never did drugs, never drank underage, always went to church, went on to a good college, and eventually to a great job at a great company.  \n\nHowever, throughout all of his life he had never found \"the one.\"  Always, there was a part of him that felt...empty.  \n\nOne day, he decides - once and for all - to go out into the world and find somebody that could fulfill his life, mending the void inside him.  As luck would have it, during a business trip to Beijing, he meets an absolutely gorgeous woman named Mei Chin.  She was stunningly beautiful, with a brilliant mind to match.  They hit it off immediately, and after months of perfect romance, he pops the question.  She says yes, of course.  \n\nThe wedding goes fabulously, and around the same time, John gets to meet all of Mei's family.  He especially got along with her brother, Wu Xiang Chin.  Unfortunately, he never did get very good at Chinese, and after repeated difficulty pronouncing Wu Xiang's name, they agree to simply refer to his brother-in-law as Chin, or sometimes \"Skinny Chin,\" as he was so thin that his own family frequently called him \"Skinny.\"  \n\nAfter the honeymoon, he settles down with Mei in the little village she grew up in, with all of her extended family nearby.  Life is simply beautiful.  He and Mei tended to their little farm, raising chickens and growing vegetables, selling what they did not need to provide the extra income for what luxuries they could afford.  They were not wealthy by any means, but it was a happy life.  \n\nUntil...one fateful day.  A group of bandits that had wreaked havoc in the surrounding communities had finally descended on the little village, intent on pillaging what they could to feed their growing numbers.  Before long, the bandits arrive at John and Mei's little farm, and demand that they hand over the chickens.  Now, while the chickens didn't provide much income, their eggs and occasional meat provided essential nourishment for him and Mei.  Set upon on all sides with scimitars and spears, John cowered, unable to risk Mei's life, nor his own, as precious as the chickens were.  \n\nSuddenly, there is a yelp from behind the group of bandits.  Chin crashes through the mass of men, planting his feet firmly in front of the chicken coop, with arms stretched, clearly defying the bandits and protecting the livelihood of Mei and her husband.  Chin glowers at the bandits as they begin to circle him, brandishing their weapons.  Witnessing his brother-in-law's spirit, John finally finds his courage and rises, standing next to his kin in solidarity.  \n\nImmediately, the bandit's leader growls, \"Get out of the way, or we'll cut him down, and you'll be next.\"\n\nJohn stared at the leader right in the eyes, and whispered,    \n          \n  \n  \n\"Not by the hair on my skinny Chin kin.\"  ",

This consisted of specific dances and celebrations, body paint, and the most noticeable and apparent: the use of glass buildings and structures. The people who lived in the village believed in complete and utter honesty. Therefore, telling a lie was punishable by death, and nothing could be hidden from anyone. Everything was out in the open just as it had been for centuries. \n        Their leaders had been the best of the society, the most honest and able to lead. So, when one leader died, there were 7 days and 7 nights of grieving, and then 7 days and 7 nights of celebration for the new leader, who would be selected by the elder council over the time period. And so after a week of eating, drinking, and dancing, the new leader was announced. A young man named Joseph, who was young but very effective and of course honest, was to be the new ruler. As the village celebrated, Joseph was officially crowned. \n        Another part of the culture of the strange village was the elaborate, beautiful thrones that were created specially for each new ruler. Craftsmen spent hours upon hours crafting them from stone, precious gems, and of course, mainly glass. Joseph was created his throne within the next few days after his crowning and it was given to him. He loved it, just as all the rulers before him had loved theirs. Everything was well in the village for the next months. Joseph was a fantastic leader (as expected) and the village was successful and efficient. However, the peace was shattered one day by the most heinous crime committed in the village. \n        As the people awoke one Monday, word spread like wildfire that Joseph's throne had been stolen. The people were appalled, and Joseph was infuriated. In the many centuries the village had thrived, this crime was the worst. Such an honest society of people had never seen such a evil deed, especially including something as important as the throne. Joseph ordered a search of everyone for the next 7 days and 7 nights, but it was clear that it would not be found considering nobody saw the throne in anyone's glass house. \n        The craftsmen quickly created a new and arguably better throne for Joseph, and slowly the town calmed down and went back to normal, despite the air of suspicion and distrust between the villagers. These feelings intensified in to chaos when the second throne was found stolen as well. As anarchy ensued, Joseph did his best to keep order while also finding his beloved thrones. Another search was ordered,  and the guards of the city worked tirelessly to find the missing thrones. At the end of the 3rd day of searching, a guard named Gary was walking home to his glass home when he passed Joseph's old home he resided in before he became leader. As he walked past it, he noticed a small path that lead through some tall grass in the backyard. Suspicion amplified due to the unrest throughout the village, he decide to investigate. \n        Gary followed the path for a while before he reached the end, which held a small glass house, one he didn't know about. Through the glass he saw the two stolen thrones, both perfectly intact. He rushed to report his findings to the remaining search force, and as the investigation unraveled, it was found that Joseph himself was responsible for the theft of his own thrones. His obsession with the beautiful thrones had come to a point where he smuggled them in to his childhood home just so he could have more and more. A trial was held, and Joseph was unanimously sentenced to death as the town began to recover from the shock of such an event.\n\nThe moral of the story?\n\nThose in glass houses shall not stow thrones.

Most puzzling.\" So the magistrate kept listening; \"There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...\" Suddenly, the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, \"My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about.

When asked why he had not used this time to go over his work and eliminate some of its obvious defects, he became righteously offended that this would have intruded into his day off. In recognition of his talents, and in an effort to foster their development, God was given an indefinite extension for the assignment before grading. In this time he has made little to no effort to improve upon his original work, and appears to have lost all interest. God's holier-than-thou attitude has risen to such arrogance that he seems to believe that he is just owed worship, and need make no effort at all.

We didn't need their money to help us with the marriage, my wife is very well off, and I'm not doing too bad myself. The first few weeks of marriage were amazing. We treasured every moment of it. But then on the sixteenth of June, everything turned bad. My wife found a lump on the underside of her breast. We immediately went to the doctors, and they said they caught it too late and it had spread to her brain. We were devastated. We cried for what seemed like hours. My beautiful wife lost all her hair and was being bombarded by radiation and chemo. I stayed with her at the hospital for 80% of the day. My office paid me while I was gone, God bless them. I assumed hers did too she got a letter from them and said they were. She didn't want me to worry... Then she started getting real bad. That cough. It was heartbreaking. The doctor said she only had about a week left to live. I cried my fucking eyes out. For that week I spent every second with her. On the night of July 2nd she passed. I cried so fucking much. I lifted her up and found that letter. The letter that said her work would pay her during sick leave. I opened it up. Then my heart broke even more. We would not have the money to pay for our bills. She hadn't been getting paid sick leave. On the letter it read 3 words: Victoria, you're fired.",

When the clerk replied, \"Yes,\" the cop asked why he didn't help out. \"I thought fifteen was enough,\" came the reply.             \n             \nWhat do you call 50 pakis at the bottom of the ocean?             \nA good start.             \n             \n             \nQ : What do you call a Paki on the moon?...                        \n       \nA : Problem...       \n              \nQ : What do you call 10 Pakis on the moon?...          \n              \nA : Problem...             \n              \nQ : What do you call 100 Pakis on the moon?...         \n           \nA : Problem...               \n                \nQ :What do you call all the Pakis on the moon?...                            \n             \nA : ................

A rescue officer came down the ladder and pleaded with the man, \"Grab my hand and I will pull you up!\" But the man STILL refused, folding his arms tightly to his body. \u201cNo thank you! God will save me!\u201d\n\nShortly after, the house broke up and the floodwaters swept the man away and he drowned.\n\nWhen in Heaven, the man stood before God and asked, \u201cI put all of my faith in You. Why didn\u2019t You come and save me?\u201d\n\nAnd God said, \u201cSon, I sent you a warning. I sent you a car. I sent you a canoe. I sent you a motorboat. I sent you a helicopter.

Caught by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged in 1889.' \n \n So Judy recently e-mailed Congressman Harry Reid for information about their great-great uncle. \n Harry Reid:\n\n  Believe it or not, Harry Reid's staff sent back the following biographical sketch for her genealogy research:\n \n \"Remus Reid was a famous cowboy in the Montana Territory . His business empire grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets and intimate dealings with the Montana railroad. Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years of his life to government service, finally taking leave to resume his dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective Agency. In 1889, Remus passed away during an important civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which he was standing collapsed.\" \n \nNOW THAT's how it's done, Folks!

        "body": "that sparked my interest. The occasion was our 15th anniversary and I was looking for a little something extra for my wife Julie. What I came across was a 100,000-volt, pocket/purse- sized tazer. The effects of the tazer were supposed to be short lived, with no long-term adverse affect on your assailant, allowing her adequate time to retreat to safety?? \n\nWAY TOO COOL! Long story short, I bought the device and brought it home.. I loaded two AAA batteries in the darn thing and pushed the button. Nothing! I was disappointed. I learned, however, that if I pushed the button and pressed it against a metal surface at the same time; I'd get the blue arc of electricity darting back and forth between the prongs. \n\nAWESOME!!! \n\nUnfortunately, I have yet to explain to Julie what that burn spot is on the face of her microwave. \n\nOkay, so I was home alone with this new toy, thinking to myself that it couldn't be all that bad with only two triple-A batteries, right? There I sat in my recliner, my cat Gracie looking on intently (trusting little soul) while I was reading the directions and thinking that I really needed to try this thing out on a flesh & blood moving target. I must admit I thought about zapping Gracie (for a fraction of a second) and thought better of it. She is such a sweet cat. But, if I was going to give this thing to my wife to protect herself against a mugger, I did want some assurance that it would work as advertised. Am I wrong? \n\nSo, there I sat in a pair of shorts and a tank top with my reading glasses perched delicately on the bridge of my nose, directions in one hand, and tazer in another. The directions said that a one-second burst would shock and disorient your assailant; a two-second burst was supposed to cause muscle spasms and a major loss of bodily control; a three-second burst would purportedly make your assailant flop on the ground like a fish out of water. Any burst longer than three seconds would be wasting the batteries. \n\nAll the while I'm looking at this little device measuring about 5\" long, less than 3/4 inch in circumference; pretty cute really and (loaded with two itsy, bitsy triple-A batteries) thinking to myself, 'no possible way!' What happened next is almost beyond description, but I'll do my best! \n\nI'm sitting there alone, Gracie looking on with her head cocked to one side as to say, 'don't do it dipshit,' reasoning that a one second burst from such a tiny little ole thing couldn't hurt all that bad. I decided to give myself a one second burst just for heck of it. I touched the prongs to my naked thigh, pushed the button, and . . \n\nHOLY MOTHER OF GOD . . WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION . . . WHAT THE HELL!!! \n\nI'm pretty sure Jessie Ventura ran in through the side door, picked me up in the recliner, then body slammed us both on the carpet, over and over and over again. I vaguely recall waking up on my side in the fetal position, with tears in my eyes, body soaking wet, both nipples on fire, testicles nowhere to be found, with my left arm tucked under my body in the oddest position, and tingling in my legs? The cat was making meowing sounds I had never heard before, clinging to a picture frame hanging above the fireplace, obviously in an attempt to avoid getting slammed by my body flopping all over the living room. \n\nNote: If you ever feel compelled to 'mug' yourself with a tazer, one note of caution: there is no such thing as a one second burst when you zap yourself! You will not let go of that thing until it is dislodged from your hand by a violent thrashing about on the floor.. A three second burst would be considered conservative? \n\nIT HURT LIKE HELL!!! \n\nA minute or so later (I can't be sure, as time was a relative thing at that point), I collected my wits (what little I had left), sat up and surveyed the landscape. My bent reading glasses were on the mantel of the fireplace. The recliner was upside down and about 8 feet or so from where it originally was. My triceps, right thigh and both nipples were still twitching. My face felt like it had been shot up with Novocain, and my bottom lip weighed 88 lbs. I had no control over the drooling. \n\nApparently I pooped on myself, but was too numb to know for sure and my sense of smell was gone. I saw a faint smoke cloud above my head, which I believe came from my hair. I'm still looking for my nuts and I'm offering a significant reward for their safe return! \n\nP.S. My wife, can't stop laughing about my experience, loved the gift, and now regularly threatens me with it! \n",

As the bartender brings his beer, the man asks him, \"What's with the guy with the big orange head?\"\n\nThe bartender chuckles. \"Yeah,\" he says, \"That's a helluva story, alright. Why don't you go buy him a drink, and maybe he'll tell you about it.\"\n\nSo the man walks over to the guy with the orange head, introduces himself, and offers to buy him a beer. The guy with the orange head says, \"Let me guess. You want to hear about the head?\"\n\nThe first guy says, \"Well, yeah. If you don't mind.\"\n\nThe man with the orange head says, \"Alright. Lord knows I've run it over in my mind a million times, anyway. So, it's like this: One day, I was walking along a beach, when I stubbed my toe on something. I looked down, and there, sticking out of the sand, was an antique lamp. So I picked it up and brushed away some of the sand, when a big cloud of blue smoke erupted from it. When the smoke cleared, a genie was standing there. And this genie said to me, 'Thank you for freeing me from my 5,000-year confinement. For doing this, I will grant you two wishes.'\n\n\"So, I think, wow, okay. And I do what many people would. For my first wish, I wish to be fantastically wealthy. So the genie snaps his fingers, and suddenly I'm covered in jewels. Hundreds of necklaces, three rings per finger, a crown on my head, and a chest full of gold next to me besides all that.\"\n\nAt this point in the story, the first man is in amazement. He just can't believe what he's hearing. Eager to hear the rest, he says, \"So what was your second wish?\"\n\nThe man with the orange head slowly takes a sip of his beer. He puts it down, and says, \"You know. This may be where I went wrong... I wished for a big orange head.\"",

The doctor thought for a moment and said \"Hmm, tricky situation. But I have a solution to the problem if young sir would permit.\" The husband being very concerned agreed that the doctor could use whatever method to get the bee out of his wife's vagina. The doctor said \"OK, what I'm gonna do is rub some honey over the top of my penis and insert it into your wife's vagina. When I feel the bee getting closer to the tip of my penis I shall withdraw it and the bee should hopefully follow my penis out of your wife's vagina. The husband nodded and gave his approval. The young lady said \"Yes, Yes, whatever, just get on with it.\" So the doctor, after covering the tip of his penis with honey, inserted it into the young lady's vagina. After a few gentle strokes, the doctor said, \"I don't think the bee has noticed the honey yet. Perhaps I should go a bit deeper.\" So the doctor went deeper and deeper. After a while the doctor began shafting the young lady very hard indeed. The young lady began to quiver with excitement. She began to moan and groan aloud. The doctor, concentrating very hard, looked like he was enjoying himself, he then put his hands on the young lady's breasts and started making loud noises. The husband at this point suddenly became very annoyed and shouted, \"Now wait a minute! What the Hell do you think you're doing?\" The doctor, still concentrating, replied, \"Change of plan.

In fact, because her English wasn't so great she barely knew what the term \"seagull\" meant, though she understood \"go shoot\" just fine. So she packed her guns and flew to America, where she figured she'd find a seagull one day or another.\n\nWell, she spends a good few weeks in America getting settled, seeing the sights, things like that. One day she ends up on the beach, just because you know, people go to the beach. She spends a great day on the beach, swimming, tanning, playing some volleyball with strangers, etc. After the sun sets, she's packing up and having some trouble with her umbrella. A man walks up to her and likes what he sees, starts talking her up, helping her out.\n\nThe two really hit it off well, even with the language barrier, and it's clear there's some mutual chemistry going on. Finally, the man asks her: \"So what brings you to the States?\"\n\n\"Eet eez for 'unting seagulls,\" she replies in her thick French accent. \"But I 'ave not found any.\"\n\n\"Well, bad luck with that!\" says the man. \"There were seagulls all over the beach earlier today but they're all gone now.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" murmurs the French woman, crestfallen. \"Zat eez unfortunate. I can't belief I 'ad such an opportunity and meessed eet.\"\n\n\"Yeah well, easy come easy go, right?\" the man laughs. The woman isn't familiar with this English turn of phrase but laughs with him anyways.\n\n\"Say uh,\" the man begins again, looking around furtively. \"Sorry if this sounds forward but do you want to, maybe, go get some dinner or something?\"\n\nThe woman gives him a coy grin. \"I would love to,\" she says.\n\nSo the two go and have a great night out on the town. The man treats her to a surf and turf over wine, and later they hit the clubs and dance until past midnight. One thing sort of leads to another as they tend to do at clubs and it ends up back in the man's hotel room with the French woman and one of the man's friends, all drunk.\n\nSorry. This isn't part of the story; I'm just apologizing in advance.\n\nAnyway, the three of them eschew the foreplay and start going at it. I'll spare the details here but it would've been clear to anyone watching that the French chick really knew what she was doing and knew how to work two guys. The first man doesn't last more than half an hour before he's out, but the man's friend keeps going on and on for hours. Finally, he can't hold it in anymore and just explodes everywhere, all over her face, her chest, and her legs.\n\n\"Wow,\" she purrs. \"Do you see zat?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah I do,\" the man's friend says with a grin. He leans back and admires his handiwork as the woman abruptly reaches into her bag, pulls a pistol, and shoots him twice in the chest and once in the head.\n\n\"Oh my god!\" screams the other man. \"What the fuck did you do that for!?\"\n\nThe woman looks back at him in confusion. \"I am 'unting seagulls, you know zees, oui?\" \n\nThe man sputters in disbelief. \"Wh-you can't possibly have thought that he was a seagull!\"\n\n\"But eet eez as you said - 'e see cum, 'e seagull!\"",

Exasperated with trying and failing to find a prince, the princess said to her father, \"If no man I can bring home will satisfy you, then find a man for me!\" The king was delighted! This was all he had ever wanted. And so, the king issued a royal decree: \n\n\"To all eligible bachelors of the realm: I invite you to the castle on the first day of the next month in a challenge to fight for my daughter, the princess. The champion shall be granted the opportunity to court her, and if she so decides, marry her.\"\n\nLo and behold, at the first of the month, thousands of men were lined up at the castle gates. The king invites the men into his gymnasium, where they see the largest swimming pool they have ever witnessed. The king instructs the men to line up on the edge of the pool. \"Men, the first of you to cross this vast pool and climb out on my side shall be the champion and will be allowed to court my daughter.\" Instantly, all the men inch closer to the edge, ready to dive in and swim faster than they ever have before. \"But wait,\" says the king, motioning to his servants. The servants then dump hundreds of sharks, piranhas, snapping turtles, and jelly fish into the pool. As if on cue, every single man takes two steps back. No man would ever dare brave these waters, which is exactly the king's intentions. No man is good enough for his daughter. A smug grin begins to spread across the king's face, when a loud splash breaks the silence. Everyone in the room gasps immediately as a single man swims frantically across the pool. The king had never seen anyone move with such speed! \n\nWhen the man finally crosses to the king's side of the pool, he climbs out, bloody and with large bite marks covering his body. The king is struck with disbelief, \"My boy, what you have just done is the bravest thing I have ever seen. Not only will I allow you to court my daughter, but I will grant you one wish, so long as it is within my power.\"\nBent over from exhaustion, the man pants, \"Thank you, your majesty. I know what I would like.\"\n\"Are you sure? You've just had a very traumatic experience! You should rest for a few days, think about it, and then come back to me and I will make it so.\"\nThe man insists, \"No, sir, I know exactly what I want.\"\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\"Yes, I am very sure.\"\n\"Well, then what do you want?\"\n\"The name of the asshole that pushed me.\"",

I don't even think I can do this but I bet you  $1500 that I can put a shot glass at one end of your bar and then stand on the other end and piss and make every last drop into that shot glass.\" the bartender looks at the man suspiciously but decides to take the bet thinking that it's impossible.  So the guy puts the shot glass on one end and gets up on the other end of the bar. He unzips and pisses all over the bar.  The piss didn't even make it anywhere near the shot glass.

I just hate this god-forsaken Chinese name and I want to get rid of it forever.\" He seemed pretty adamant about it, so I decided the best decision would be to take him. We walked out to my car, and right as I put the keys in the ignition Ling came running and tapped on the car door like a madman. I rolled it down and she started freaking out about how Ving's name had been passed down through generations and generations, but Ving didn't care. He just wanted to go down to the Courthouse and get it over with. Ling figured that coming with would be the best idea, so if anything else came up that she would be needed for, she would be there for Ving. Honestly, I felt stuck in the middle of a family feud, so I just took her along.\n\nWhen we got to the Courthouse, Ving confidently walked up to the front desk and asked the receptionist if he could change his name. She gave him a little packet of paper and told him to sit down. Ling and I waited patiently while Ving filled out his info. I was watching him fill it out and I noticed he really did want to change his name to Lee. Before he finished, though, he started tearing up. He told me he couldn't change his name. He asked the lady at the front that he couldn't do it, and she told him he would need twenty dollars to cancel the request. Ling was so relieved and happy that he changed his mind, she dug through her purse, found the money, and started to hand it to the receptionist.\n\nIt was at this moment that the most stereotypical Asian man burst through the doors. He was wearing a Hawaiian shirt, a visor, American flag shorts, flip flops, everything. This little guy was decked out.\n\nWhen Ving and his old man saw each other, they both started bawling, and embraced each other. Out of his tears, Ving said\n\n\"Dad, I love my name. I want to be Ving forever, and I'm going to name my kids Ving, and they're going to name their kids Ving, and-\"\n\nAnd the old man said \"Dont, stop. Be Lee, Ving! Hold onto that fee, Ling.\"\n",

She appeared to be close to his age and he was ecstatic. Throughout the meal she is gave him a seductive look and touched his leg under the table.\n\nAfter dinner Jimmy goes to bed. He could not contain himself, he tried so hard not to go to her room. He finally caved and went into her room and they made passionate love all night. In the early morning, Jimmy went back to his room, exhausted but satisfied.\n\nWhen Jimmy woke in the morning he had a boulder on his chest. He noticed a sign on the ceiling that said, Chinese torture number one: boulder on chest.\n\nJimmy thought, \"Ha! Gonna have to do better than that!\" And throws the boulder out the window.\n\nThen jimmy notices a sign on the window that says, Chinese torture number 2: right testicle tied to boulder.\n\n To avoid castration, Jimmy jumps out the window. \n\nAs Jimmy is plummeting from the second story he sees a sign on the lawn that says, Chinese torture number three: left testicle tied to bedpost.\n\nTL:DR: don't sleep with the Chinese man's daughter, you'll lose your left nut",

Upon coming back home, the merchant sees the baby, who is obviously too young to be his own. He asks his wife: \"My dear wife, please tell me whose son is this ?\n\n-Dear husband, last winter, during a snowy day, as I was wandering, sad and crying because you were absent, I looked up in the sky in prayer for your safe return, and I accidentally ate a snowflake.

I will raise this child as my own, as we are blessed by Him !\"\n\nThe merchant does not say any more word, although he is suspicious, and carries on with his life, often leaving for 1 or 2 years travelling in the East. When the boy reaches the age of 15, the merchant decides to take him with him for a business travel to teach him the job. The wife begs him to be careful, tells him she will pray for their success and well-being, and asks him to bring her son back home safe. The man travels to Genoa, where he meets a friend who takes him to Alexandria. There, he quickly sells the boy on the slave market, continues his business in the Middle-East, and heads back home. As he enters, his wife sees that he is alone, panics and asks him :\n\n\"Husband, where is my son ? what happened to him ?!\n\n-He melted.\"\n\nPS : paraphrase of a 800 years old joke from an old-french Fabliau\n\nsource : http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k209379m/f184.image",

At least that is what German teachers say in their first class. They start learning: der, die, das, des, dem, den and the rest just comes naturally. It\u2019s amazingly easy! If this doesn\u2019t convince you, let\u2019s learn German with an example.\n\nFirst of all, take a book in German. It\u2019s a splendid leather-covered book published in Dortmund. It is about the customs and habits of the Hottentots (which in German is Hottentotten).\n\nThe book teaches that the opossums (Beutelratten) are captured and put in cages (Kotter) with wooden slats (Lattengitter) to protect them from the elements. Those cages, in German, are called \u201ccages with wooden slats\u201d (Lattengitterkotter) and, when they have inside a opossum, we call all the group as \u201ccage with wooden slats with an opossum\u201d (Beutelrattenlattengitterkotter).\n\nOne day, the Hottentots arrested a murderer (Attent\u00e4ter), accused of having killed the Hottentot (Hottentotter) mother (Mutter) (a Hottentottermutter) of a boy who stuttered and was also a bit slow (Stottertrottel). That woman, in German, is called Hottentottenstottertrottelmutter and, her murderer, we call easily Hottentottenstottertrottelmutterattent\u00e4ter.\n\nIn the book, the Hottentots caught him and, without having where to put him, they used a opossum cage (Beutelrattenlattengitterkotter). But, incidentally, the prisoner escaped. After they began the search, quickly came up a Hottentot warrior screaming:\n\n> \"We caught the murderer (Attent\u00e4ter)!\"\n\n> \"What?,\" asked the chief.\n\n> \"Lattengitterkotterbeutelrattenattent\u00e4ter\" answered the warrior.\n\n> \"Who? The murderer that was in the cage of opossums with wooden slats?\" the chief of the Hottentots asked.\n\n> \"Yes,\" answers the native with great difficulty. \"Hottentottenstottertrottelmutteratent\u00e4ter (murderer of the Hottentot mother who had a slow and stuttering child).\"\n\n> \"Ah,\" the chief says, \"you could have said from the start that you had caught the Hottentottenstottertrottelmutterbeutelrattenlattengitterkotterattent\u00e4ter!\"\n\nAs it can be noticed, German is very easy.

The next morning, the man woke up, and found that his whole floor was completely covered in one hundred dollar bills. The man, realizing that the wishes were no scam, ran downstairs in anticipation, and was promptly greeted by twenty absolutely stunning models, all gathered in his living room. The man was filled with so much delight, that he spun around in enjoyment; basking in the spectacular wonder that was filling his life. As the man went to greet the models, he was grabbed violently from behind by the two Genie's. They dragged him outside to the biggest tree they could find, tied a noose around his neck, and hung him right then and there. When his legs stopped kicking, the Genie's walked away somewhat perplexed. Finally, one Genie turns to the other and says;\n\"Ok, so I get the whole 'floor-covered-in-one-hundred-dollar-bills' thing, and the twenty models wish...

They decide to go to the local orphanage to acquire one their fine, young people. \"What is the timeline you are working with?\" says the man in charge. \"We would love to adopt as soon as possible. We just want to put all of our love into this one little ball of sunshine!\" says Mary. \"I usually don't do this, but we have a special case. You two seem to be the best for the job,and we can give him to you as soon as today\" says the man. \"We are up for anything. We have the means, and the love to give the boy a good home. What, though, is wrong with him?\" says John. The man replied, \"Well...It's...Um....Well it's better that I show you.\" The three approach an opened, size 10 shoe box facing away from them, toward a window. \"Frank...some people are here to see you!\" says the man. A small voice comes from the shoe box, \"REALLY!? Show them to me!\" The man picks up the shoe box, and the couple is surprised to see a young boy with no legs, arms, or torso. Frank was just a head. \"How would you like a warm home and two loving parents?\" Says John. A single tear rolls down Frank's face. \"Do you know how long I've waited for this?\" says the head. The rest of the day was spent in pure bliss for the young couple who gained a 1/6 of a son, and for the young cranium who gained two whole parents! The boy soon begins being homeschooled by Mary, who is too protective to send Frank to public school. Frank lives a life of seclusion. He finishes high school at an early age. He graduates college, and begins work at google. He invents the Google glass at age 20. His parents are exponentially proud, but feel he has missed out on a normal life. Frank's 21st birthday rolls around. His usual birthdays went like any normal day only Mary would bake him a cake, and John would give him a new pair of ear-muffs. This year, however, was different. John says to Frank, \"You're 21 today son, I'm going to take you out for your first beer.\" Frank replies, \"Yayyyyyy, I love you Dad!\" The two walk into the bar \"Bar Tender, give me and my son one of your best beers\" The father poors the beer into Frank's mouth...*poof* as if by magic, a torso appears, and its attached to Frank! \"Oh my Fuck.\" they all say in unison. \"Give my son another beer\" says John. John poors the beer *zap* legs appear on Frank's body. The father poors another beer into his now leggy son. *snap* Arms appear on the somehow, fully clothed, 21 year old, Frank! \"BAR TENDER MY SON IS A FULL HUMAN BEING! GIVE US ONE MORE BEER TO CELEBRATE!\" says John. \"CHEERS\" they all say, the glasses clink as they all take a sip. *CRASH* a single solitary glass shatters as if it fell right out the air. \"Oh my God, my son...he has disappeared...right before my eyes\" says John. The Bar Tender replies, \"I guess he should have stopped while he was aHead.\"",

How good are you doing laundry?\" The dog says \"I can't do laundry what do you think I am? I'm only a dog\" so the man takes the dog back to his friend and tells him \"This dog is good at dishes but he's useless for anything else. What else do you have?\" His friends thinks for a second and says \"ok I've got the perfect thing for you. Take this parrot. He can do whatever you want.\" So the man takes the parrot home and asks him to do the dishes. The parrot gets to work and does an even better job than the dog. He even dries them and puts them away. The man is applauds the parrot and asks about the laundry. The parrot starts laundry with no trouble at all. The man says \"wow you're amazing! How are you at vacuuming?\" The parrot replies \"I can't vacuum what do you think I am? I'm only a parrot.\" So the man takes the parrot back to his friend and tells him his problem.

He takes the milipede home and explains his chores. The milipede gets to work. He washes the dishes perfectly. Dries them, puts them away, and even organizes the cabinets. He does laundry with no hassle at all. Folds them and neatly puts them in the man's dresser. He even irons the man's dress shirts. He vacuums the entire house, mops the floor, and dusts everything. The man is astonished. He says \"wow you're amazing! Here's my grocery list. Are you capable of getting everything?\" The milipede says yes and walks out the door. The man waits for the milipede to return. He watches the clock as minutes turn to hours. After waiting for what seemed like forever the man gets worried that something happened to the milipede. He goes to look for him and walks out the door to find the milipede still right outside. He angrily says \"what are you doing!? I've been waiting and waiting on you. Why are you still here!?\" The milipede looks up and says \"well sir, I'm still tying my shoes!\"",

Else, they will be killed and, after preparation with the best seasonings available, eaten.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe king explains that they will be allowed into the forest with two tribespeople.

He's proud that he found his items so quickly, and he dumps ten apples on the ground in front of the king. \"I'm ready for the second part,\" he says.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe king explains the second part. When each man comes back with his fruits or vegetables, he is to shove all ten up his ass. The kicker: They are to do this without any face, grimace of pain, or reaction.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nHorrified, Man #1 successfully takes in one whole apple. He almost finishes the second one, but then he winces from the pain. He's killed instantly by a tribe member, and dragged away.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSome time passes.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nNow, Man #2 is on his way back. He stands before the king, and presents his find: Raspberries.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe king smiles and explains that he is to insert the raspberries into his ass without any face, grimace, etc. The man, slightly used to this kind of foreplay, obliges. He gets to the ninth raspberry, but then starts laughing uncontrollably. He's of course killed and dragged away.\n_____________________________\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThese first two men, they meet in heaven.

He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked 'Is the coming winter going to be cold?'\n\n'It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,' the weather man responded.\n\nSo the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood. A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. 'Is it going to be a very cold winter?'\n\n'Yes,' the man at National Weather Service again replied, 'It's definitely going to be a very cold winter.'\n\nThe Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.\n\nTwo weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again.\n\n'Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?'

But I have a solution to the problem if young sir would permit.\" The husband being very concerned agreed that the doctor could use whatever method to get the bee out of his wife's vagina. The doctor said \"OK, what I'm gonna do is rub some honey over the top of my penis and insert it into your wife's vagina. When I feel the bee getting closer to the tip of my penis I shall withdraw it and the bee should hopefully follow my penis out of your wife's vagina. The husband nodded and gave his approval. The young lady said \"Yes, Yes, whatever, just get on with it.\"\n\n\nSo the doctor, after covering the tip of his penis with honey, inserted it into the young lady's vagina. After a few gentle strokes, the doctor said, \"I don't think the bee has noticed the honey yet. Perhaps I should go a bit deeper.\" So the doctor went deeper and deeper. After a while the doctor began shafting the young lady very hard indeed.\n\n\nThe young lady began to quiver with excitement. She began to moan and groan aloud.\n\n\nThe doctor, concentrating very hard, looked like he was enjoying himself, he then put his hands on the young lady's breasts and started making loud noises.\n\n\nThe husband at this point suddenly became very annoyed and shouted, \"Now wait a minute!

Now, luckily Farmer Jones came along on his old John Deere, and Jim explained what had happened.  Of course they both realized it was way too late to get him help that evening, so Farmer Jones took him on home.\n\nWhen they got there, Jim saw it was nothing but a tiny one room shack, without even a decent barn, and he got to thinking he might just have been better staying in the car.  But Farmer Jones assured Jim that they had a big ol' bed for just him and his young wife, and they wouldn't mind lending him some space with them.  Just as Jim got to thinking it over, out walked Mrs. Jones, and damn if she wasn't the prettiest little thing Jim had ever cast his eyes upon.  Of course Jim knew better than to try anything with the farmer's wife, seeing as Farmer Jones was a big ol' boy and all, but that wouldn't stop him from thinking about it anyway.\n\nWell as they were dozing off, Jim on one side of the farmer, and the missus on the other, over the farmer's snoring Jim heard Mrs Jones calling his name.\n\n\"Hey Jim, how about you come over here and make sweet love to me?\" Jim was shocked, of course, not believing what he was hearing.  But she told him she was very serious, and that she knew once her husband started snoring, well nothing was going to wake him.  And when he still wasn't sure, she told him to just reach down between his cheeks and pluck out a hair.  After a few more denials, Jim finally gets up the nerve and reaches down.  <BOINK!> the hair came free, and Farmer Jones never even flinched!  \n\nNot believing his luck, Jim immediately hopped over and gave that young woman all he could, then settled back on his own side again.\n\nBut, sure enough, not much later he is once again woken by the farmer's wife begging him to give her another round.  But, believing there was no way the farmer could keep sleeping, he wouldn't give in until she had him pluck another hair from his ass.  And sure enough, <BOINK!> not even a change to his snoring.  So, Jim jumped over again and gave her an even wilder ride this time, before once again settling back on his own side.\n\nBut again, just as he was dozing off, he heard the farmer's wife calling for more!  This time it took no argument at all ... He just reached down and grabbed another hair from the farmer's ass.  <BOINK!>\n\nBut this time, before he could breathe a sigh of relieve, Farmer Jones sits straight up and grabs Jim by the throat.\n\n\"Look,\" he says in his deep voice, \"if you want to fuck my wife, that is between you and her!

He finds a cab, jumps in and tells the driver to hit it, right to St. Helens Hospital, where his wife was delivering their first baby.  \nArriving at the hospital, he runs to the front desk, gets his directions and jumps up the stairs to the maternity ward. Right as he is coming out of the stairwell, he sees a nurse coming out of the delivery room at the end of the corridor, with a tiny bundle in her arms.  \nAs he is immediately sure this must be his baby, he starts beaming and swiftly walking towards the nurse. Noticing him, she also puts on a radiant smile and casually breaks one of the baby's tiny arms.  \nRick stops mortified, not able to say anything, when the nurse again smiles her fantastic smile and starts twisting the small leg peeking out of the bundle. She continues to take the baby's head, acting as if she wanted to break the little's neck. Rick, coming back to his senses, starts running and screaming, only to see the nurse snap the thin neck while winking and smiling.  \n\"Oh my god, what on earth are you doing to my baby?!\", he screams in horror, ready to attack her, before she stops him with a contagious little laughter: \"April fool!\", she says, \"It was already dead.\"",

However, as the Mufti spoke no Italian and the Pope spoke no Arabic, they agreed that it would be a \"silent\" debate. On the chosen day the Pope and Mufti sat opposite each other. The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. The Mufti looked back and raised one finger. Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Mufti pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. The Mufti pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Mufti was too clever. The Muslims could stay in Italy. \n\nLater the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, \"First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God!  Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He beat me at every move and I could not continue!\" \n\nMeanwhile, the Muslim community gathered to ask the Mufti how he'd won. \"I haven't a clue,\" the Mufti said. \"First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.

St. Peter says, \"Well Forrest, it's certainly good to see you. We have heard a lot about you.  I must inform you that the place is filling up fast, and we've been administering an entrance examination for everyone. The tests are fairly short, but you need to pass before you can get into Heaven.\" Forrest responds \"It shore is good to be here St.Peter. I was looking forward to this. Nobody ever told me about any entrance exam. Sure hope the test ain't too hard: life was a big enough test as it was.\" St. Peter goes on, \"Yes, I know Forrest, but the test I have for you is only three questions.\n\n1.What days of the week begin with the letter T?\n\n\\2. How many seconds are there in a year? \n\n\\3.What is God's first name?\"\n\n Forrest goes away to think the questions over.  He returns the next day and goes up to St. Peter to try to answer the exam questions. St. Peter waves him up and says, \"Now that you have had a chance to think the questions over, tell me your answers.\" \n\nForrest says, \"Well, the first one - how many days of the week begin with the letter \"T\"? Shucks, that one's easy. That'd be Today and Tomorrow.\" The Saint's eyes open wide and he exclaims,  \"Forrest! That's not what I was thinking, but....you do have a point though, and I guess I didn't specify, so I give you credit for that answer. \n\nHow about the next one?\" asks St.Peter. \"How many seconds in a year?\" \"Now that one's harder,\" says Forrest, \"But I thunk and thunk about that and I guess the only answer can be twelve.\" Astounded St. Peter says,\"Twelve!? Twelve!?  Forrest, how in Heaven's name could you come up with twelve seconds in a year?\" Forest says \"Shucks, there's gotta be twelve: January second, February second, March second.....\" \"Hold it,\" interrupts St. Peter. \"I see where you're going with this. And I guess I see your point, though that wasn't quite what I had in mind, but I'll give you credit for that one, too.\"\n\n \"Let's go on with the next and final question. Can you tell me God's first name?\" \n\nForrest replied, \"Andy.\" \n\"OK, OK,\" said a frustrated St.Peter, \"I guess I can understand how you came up with your answers to my first two questions, but just how in the world did you came up with the name Andy as the first name of God?\" \"That was the easiest one of all,\" \n\nForrest replied  \"I learned it from the song..... \n\n\"ANDY WALKS WITH ME, ANDY TALKS WITH ME, ANDY TELLS ME I AM HIS OWN\" \n\n\nSt.Peter opened the gates and said: Run Forest, Run...",

Why are you crying?\" He asks gently.\n\nThe boy wipes away his tears and replies, \"Oh, there's just a lot of things going wrong in my life right now. I'm sorry if I bothered you.\"\n\nMr. Smith takes note of the boy's politeness, \"Is there anything I can do to help? Why don't you tell me what's going on...\"\n\nWith that the boy breaks down and sobs. \n\nHe starts going on and on about his troubles. \n\nHis mother is dying of cancer and can't work. \n\nThey can't afford the medicine to manage her symptoms. \n\nThey haven't eaten in days. \n\nNot even an hour ago the boy had been caught dumpster diving behind a restaurant for food and was caned by the owner. \n\nHe tried to go home to his mother but when he got there he saw an eviction notice on the door and he just couldn't bring himself to go inside and give her the news. \n\nEverything was just falling apart and he couldn't take it.\n\n \"So I came here and just cried,\" he finished.\n\nMr. Smith was shocked. \n\nOf all the people he could have encountered he encountered this boy. \n\nHe could solve this boy's problems with a single check. \n\nBut Mr. Smith was a firm believer in earning what you got no matter what it was. \n\nAs the boy continued to cry, Mr. Smith looked out to the water...\n\n\"Son,\" Mr. Smith began, \"What's your name?\"\n\n\"My name is Johnny.\" The boy said.\n\n\"Johnny, you see that ship out there,\" he said gesturing to a ship about a mile out from the dock, \"I'll make you a deal. If you can swim out to that ship, climb up the mast and wave to me I will write you a check for one million dollars.\"\n\nJohnny was awestruck. \"You really mean it?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\" Mr. Smith confirmed.\n\nJohnny dove into the water without a word and swam like a madman. \n\nMr. Smith watched with a smile on his face but his smile faded when Johnny turned around and came back. \n\nWhen Johnny reached the dock he explained he got too tired too quickly and knew he wouldn't make it.\n\n\"Well that's ok, Johnny. Tomorrow let's meet here, same time, and you can try again.\"\n\nThe next day they met and Johnny tried but once again he got fatigued and had to turn back. \n\nMr. Smith asked him if he'd eaten anything and Johnny told him he hadn't. \n\nWith that, Mr. Smith gave him some money for a small meal and told him tomorrow was his last day in town so if he was going to succeed it had to be then.\n\nThe next day Mr. Smith arrived and Johnny was waiting at the dock with a smile on his face. \"You all fed and ready?\" Mr. Smith asked.\n\n\"Yes, Sir\" said Johnny. \n\nAnd Johnny dove into the water. \n\nThis time he was swimming a bit slower. \n\nHe seemed to be pacing himself.\nMr. Smith watched Johnny get further and further and his smile grew and grew. \n\nWhat a perfect end to a perfect trip. \n\nHe was going to make a difference in this boy's life.\n\nJohnny made it to the ship. \n\nMr. Smith watched him climb up the mast. \n\nJohnny held on with one hand and reached the other out and started to wave victoriously but suddenly he lost his grip! \n\nJohnny slipped and fell from the top of the mast all the way down to the ship below with a loud thud that echoed in the distance...\n\nBut Johnny was ok, know why?\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nHe was used to hardships...",

I had gone to catch a train, This was April 1976, in Cambridge, U.K. \nI was about twenty minutes early. \nI'd got the time of the train wrong. I suppose it is at least equally possible,\"\nhe added after a moment's reflection, \n\"that British Rail had got the time of the train wrong. Hadn't occurred to me before.\"\n             \"Get on with it.\" Fenchurch laughed. \n\"So I bought a newspaper, to do the crossword, and went to the buffet to get a cup of coffee.\"\n \t\"You do the crossword?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \t\"Which one?\"\n \"The Guardian usually.\"\n \t\"I think it tries to be too cute. I prefer The Times.  Did you solve it?\" \n\"What?\" \n\t\"The crossword in The Guardian.\"\n \"I haven't had a chance to look at it yet,\" said Arthur. \"I'm still trying to buy the coffee.\"\n \t\"All right then. Buy the coffee.\" \n\"I'm buying it. I am also,\" said Arthur, \"buying some biscuits.\" \n\t\"What sort?\" \n\"Rich Tea.\" \n\t\"Good choice.\"\n \"I like them.\" Laden with all these new possessions, I go and sit at a table. And don't ask me what the table was like because this was some time ago and I can't remember. It was probably round.\" \n\t\"All right.\"\n \"So let me give you the layout. Me sitting at the table, on my left, the newspaper, on my right, the cup of coffee, in the middle of the table, the packet of biscuits.\" \n\t\"I see it perfectly.\"\n \"What you don't see,\" said Arthur, \"because I haven't mentioned him yet, is the guy sitting at the table already. He is sitting there opposite me.\" \n\t\"What's he like?\"\n \"Perfectly ordinary. Briefcase. Business suit. He didn't look,\" said Arthur, \"as if he was about to do anything weird.\" \n\t\"Ah. I know the type. What did he do?\"\n \"He did this. He leaned across the table, picked up the packet of biscuits, tore it open, took one out, and . . .\"\n \t\"What?\" \n\"Ate it.\"\n \t\"What?\"\n \"He ate it.\"\n \tFenchurch looked at him in astonishment. \"What on earth did you do?\" \n\"Well, in the circumstances I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do. I was compelled,\" said Arthur, \"to ignore it.\"\n \t\"What? Why?\"\n \"Well, it's not the sort of thing you're trained for, is it? I searched my soul, and discovered that there was nothing anywhere in my upbringing, experience, or even primal instincts to tell me how to react to someone who has quite simply, calmly, sitting right there in front of me, stolen one of my biscuits.\"\n\t\"Well, you could . . .\" Fenchurch thought about it. \n\t\"I must say I'm not sure what I would have done either. So what happened?\"\n\"I stared furiously at the crossword,\" said Arthur, \"couldn't do a single clue, took a sip of coffee, it was too hot to drink, so there was nothing for it. I braced myself. I took a biscuit, trying very hard not to notice,\"\nhe added, \"that the packet was already mysteriously open. . . .\"\n\t \"But you're fighting back, taking a tough line.\"\n\"After my fashion, yes. I ate the biscuit. I ate it very deliberately and visibly, so that he would have no doubt as to what it was I was doing. When I eat a biscuit,\" said Arthur, \n\"it stays eaten.\"\n\t\"So what did he do?\"\n\"Took another one. Honestly,\" insisted Arthur, \"this is exactly what happened. He took another biscuit, he ate it. Clear as daylight. Certain as we are sitting on the ground.\"\n \tFenchurch stirred uncomfortably. \n\"And the problem was,\" said Arthur, \"that having not said anything the first time, it was somehow even more difficult to broach the subject the second time around. What do you say? 'Excuse me ...I couldn't help noticing, er . . .' \nDoesn't work. No, I ignored it with, if anything, even more vigor than previously.\"\n  \t\"My man .. .\" \n\"Stared at the crossword again, still couldn't budge a bit of it, so showing some of the spirit that Henry V did on St. Crispin's Day . .\" \n \t \"What?\" \n\"I went into the breach again. I took,\" said Arthur, \"an-other biscuit. And for an instant our eyes met.\"\n \t \"Like this?\" \n\"Yes, well, no, not quite like that. But they met. Just for an instant. And we both looked away. But I am here to tell you,\" said Arthur, \n\"that there was a little electricity in the air. There was a little tension building up over the table. At about this time.\"\n\t \"I can imagine.\"\u201d\n\"We went through the whole packet like this. Him, me, him, me . . .\"\n  \t\"The whole packet?\" \n\"Well, it was only eight biscuits, but it seemed like a lifetime of biscuits we were getting through at this point. Gladiators could hardly have had a tougher time.\"\n   \t\"Gladiators,\" said Fenchurch,\n\t \"would have had to do it in the sun. More physically gruelling.\" \n\"There is that. So. When the empty packet was lying dead between us the man at last got up, having done his worst, and left. I heaved a sigh of relief, of course. \n\"As it happened, my train was announced a moment or two later, so I finished my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper . . .\" \n   \t\"Yes?\" \n\"Were my biscuits.\" \n   \t\"What?\" said Fenchurch. \"What?\"\n\"True.\"\n \t  \"No!\"\nThe thing I like particularly about this story is the sensation that somewhere in England there has been wandering around for the last quarter-century a perfectly ordinary guy who\u2019s had the same exact story, only he doesn\u2019t have the punch line.\n",

The car ride home, the parrot had been quiet and an uneasy tension was building.  Throughout the first night, my parrot remained quiet, but the next morning, I awoke to a machine-gun sequence of swear words, rude insults, and some of the dirtiest jokes I had ever heard.  I was shocked, to say the least.  In an attempt to correct the parrot's behavior, I would read aloud children's books, play Bach and Beethoven over the speakers, and did everything I could to set a calm and relaxing atmosphere.  But it was to no avail.  The parrot remained relentlessly crass, rude, and now, it had even begun talking back and mocking me with every action I took, calling me names.  It was pushing my buttons.  Finally, I was at my last straw, and I began screaming back, trading swear words and scathing insults with this ungrateful excuse of a pet.  But in a sudden moment of clarity, I realized the ridiculousness of this situation and, immediately grabbing the bird by its neck,  placed it in the freezer, with the intent of killing it once and for all.  The parrot kicked and screamed for a good while before the kitchen grew eerily silent.  I slowly opened the freezer to check on my victim, when the parrot flies out calmly, landing on the counter.  The parrot looked up at me and said, \"I truly apologize for my behavior.  I realize now I may have been rude and insulting to you, and I will correct my attitude and my behavior from now on.\"  I was shocked.  Before I could even respond, the bird asked, \"So what did the chicken do?\"",

Her soul arrived at the Pearly Gates, where St.Peter welcomed her. \u201cBefore you get settled in\u201d he said, \u201cWe have a little problem\u2026you see, we\u2019ve never had a HR manager make it this far before and we\u2019re not really sure what to do with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I see,\u201d said the woman, \u201ccan\u2019t you just let me in?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d like to,\u201d said St Peter, \u201cBut I have higher orders. We\u2019re instructed to let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you\u2019d like to go for all eternity.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, I think I\u2019d prefer heaven\u201d, said the woman. \u201cSorry, we have rules\u2026\u201d at which St. Peter put the HR manager into the downward bound elevator.\n\n\nAs the doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times.\n\nThey played a perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed a superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had a wonderful night telling jokes and dancing.\n\nBefore she knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to spend a day in heaven,\u201d he said.\n\nSo she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day\u2019s end St. Peter returned. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve spent a day in hell and you\u2019ve spent a day in heaven\u201d. \u201cYou must choose between the two.\u201d\n\nThe woman thought for a second and replied: \u201cWell, heaven is certainly lovely, but I actually had a better time in hell. I choose Hell.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d stuttered the HR manager, \u201cThe other day I was here, and there was a golf course, and a country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had a wonderful happy time. Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.\u201d\n\nThe Devil simply looked at her and smiled, \u201cYesterday we were recruiting you, today you\u2019re staff.\u201d",

So I was like 100% sure my wife was cheating on me while I was at work.  So I decided to go home for lunch, which I never do, and sure as shit there she is naked in bed.  She had clearly been busy getting fucked, so I began searching for the guy.  I cant find him anywhere though, and we live on the tenth story so the only way in or out was through our front door.  I knew he had to be somewhere in the apartment, and I finally found him hanging from my balcony; naked!  I didn't even give him a chance to speak, I stomped on his hands till he fell.  Can you believe this asshole survived!  The bushes broke his fall.  So I push my refrigerator onto the balcony, and flip it over the edge.  As it was going over the power cord caught my foot and pulled me with it.  I hit the pavement,  and now I'm here.\"\n\n\"Oh my, that is horrible.  Please come in.\"\n\nJust then, a second man arrives.\n\n\"To pass, you must tell me about your death.\"\n\n\"Well, I lived in an eleventh story apartment.  I loved the view from my balcony, and I would often workout in the nude there.  I tripped over one of my weights and was flung over the railing, though I managed to grab hold of the balcony below.  Then the guy who lives there comes out just screaming at me, something about fucking his wife whom I've never even met.  Before I can explain, he stomps on my hands until I fall.  Somehow the bushes broke my fall, but then this asshole literally throws his refrigerator off the balcony at me.  At least I got to see that it pulled him over with it, hope he missed the bushes.  Anyways the fridge landed on me and now here I am.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, I see.  Well that is just awful.  Welcome.\"\n\nThe third arrival is now walking up to the gate.\n\n\"To pass, you must tell me about your death.\"\n\n\"Hahaha.. okay.  So get this, I'm hiding in this refrigerator...\"\n",

He think, 'if that fly drops about 6 inches, the fish will jump up, and that bear will go after the fish, and ill shoot that bear for a nice trophy.'\n\nRight behind the hunter is a mouse. Realizing what is happening,  he eagerly awaits.  'If that fly drops 6 inches, the fish will jump out of water, the bear will go after the fish, the hunter will go for the bear,  and leave his cheese sandwich unattended for me to eat some lunch.'\n\nBehind the mouse lays a cat. He understands the situation.  He says, ' if that fly drops about 6 inches, the fish will jump after it, the bear will go for the fish, the hunter will shoot the bear, the mouse will eat the cheese sandwhich,  and while he is distracted, I'll catch him and have some lunch.'\n\nAs they all wait with anticipation,  a sudden movement happens. The fly drops 6 inches! The fish jumps after the fly. The bear nabs the fish. The hunter drops his cheese sandwich and readies his rifle. The mouse runs for the cheese. The cat pounces toward the mouse, but slips and ends up drenched in the river. \n\nThe moral of this story? Anytime a fly drops about 6 inches, there is bound to be a wet pussy.",

Next he calls over Safron: You have been a very naughty hippy, Safron. Taking drugs, sleeping with everyone, and worst of all you thoought peace and love was a load of shite....and he ushers her off to the highway to hell. Poor Moonchild sits on his cloud miserable and alone, and can't believe he'll spend eternity without his true love. One day Jesus is walking past his cloud and see's how truly sad Moonchild is. 'If you're a good hippy angel after a year and a day I will allow you to go down to hell to visit Safron...but be careful now; hell is a terrible place!' Overjoyed Moonchild spends everyday practising the harp, polishing his cloud and focusing on his flying lessons. A year soon passes and Jesus leads him to the big escalator down to hell. 'Take care Moonchild and remember you only have 24 hours'. As the escalator takes him down to the firey pits Moonchild scans the faces of the tormented until he see Safron waiting for him with a big smile on her face. The two lovers are happily reunited and Safron shows he lover around Hell. Casino's, nightclubs, free alcohol and drugs, free girls, no STD's, no hangovers, and endless money....Moonchild can't believe it. This is Hell? Safron even has her own strip club and the pair spend a wild night coked up and loved up - no shame, no guilt, no consequences. As dawn breaks Safron walks Moonchild back to the escalator and bids him a teary farewell and they promise to meet in a year and a day. When Moonchild gets back to heaven Jesus is there to meet him: How was it my son, was it difficult to witness such evil? Oh Yes, Jesus sir, such a bad, bad place. So aweful, says Moonchild hiding his smile. Well, says Jesus, off you go to harp lessons and say a hail Mary as you go......oh and by the way: Where is your harp? Moonchild suddenly realises the last time he saw it it was flattened under 6 dirty, fire-breathing whores last night. Ah well, says, Moonchild 'I left my harp in Safran's Disco'..........................\n\nGet it? I left my heart in San Francisco...no? Ok, I'll apologise now and get my coat.   ",

Instead there was an adverse reaction that creates a sort of exponential comedic product \n\nSimply combine \"that's what she said\" jokes with \"yo momma\" jokes and suddenly you have \"that's what your mom said\" as a quick response to any sort of statements possible \n\nWhat you will find is people are caught completely off guard and the usual shields in place for yo momma jokes we all acquire naturally at a young age in he public school systems somehow sont respond in time and so people get angry before they realize it, I fact this joke isn't even that funny just powerful.

If anyone of you can ask me a question which I don't know or cannot answer, then you're worthy enough to go to Heaven; if not, then you'll come with me to Hell.\"\n\nThe philosopher then stepped up, \"OK, give me the most comprehensive report on Socrates' teachings.\" With a snap of his finger, a stack of paper appeared next to the Devil. The philosopher read it and concluded it was correct. \"Then, go to Hell!\" With another snap of his finger, the philosopher disappeared.\n\nThe mathematician then asked, \"Give me the most complicated formula ever theorized!\" With a snap of his finger, another stack of paper appeared next to the Devil. The mathematician read it and reluctantly agreed it was correct. \"Then, go to Hell!\" With another snap of his finger, the mathematician disappeared too.\n\nThe idiot then stepped forward and said, \"Bring me a chair!\" The Devil brought forward a chair. \"Drill 7 holes on the seat.\" The Devil did just that. The idiot then sat on the chair and let out a very loud fart. Standing up, he asked, \"Which hole did my fart come out from?\" The Devil inspected the seat and said,\"The third hole from the right.\" \"Wrong,\" said the idiot, \"it's from my asshole.\" And the idiot went to heaven.",

It can walk, eat, sleep, read and so on, but for some reason the German child never speaks. The concerned parents take it to the doctor, who reassures them that as the German child is perfectly developed in all other areas, there is nothing to worry about and that he is sure the speech faculty will eventually blossom. Years pass. The German child enters its teens, and still it is not speaking, though in all other respects it is fully functional. The German child's mother is especially distressed by this, but attempts to conceal her sadness. One day she makes the German child, who is now 17 years old and still silent, a bowl of tomato soup, and takes it through to him in the parlour where he is listening to a wind-up gramophone record player. Soon, the German child appears in the kitchen and suddenly declares, \"Mother. This soup is a little tepid.\" The German child's mother is astonished. \"All these years,\" she exclaims, \"we assumed you could not speak. And yet all along it appears you could. Why? Why did you never say anything before?\" \"Because, mother,\" answers the German child, \"up until now, everything has been satisfactory.\"",

He slapped his ticket down on the counter and said, \"I HAVE to be on this flight and it has to be first class.\"\nThe agent replied, \"I'm sorry, sir. I'll be happy to try to help you, but I've got to help these folks first, and I'm sure we'll be able to work something out.\"\nThe passenger was unimpressed.

If anyone can help him find his identity, please come to the gate.\"\nWith the folks behind him in line laughing hysterically, the man glared at the United agent, gritted his teeth and swore, \"F**k you.\" Without flinching, she smiled and said, \"I'm sorry, sir, but you'll have to stand in line for that, too.\"\nThe man retreated as the people in the terminal applauded loudly.

As you'd expect from an amateur golfer, the ball slices hard right and off the fairway, breaking a window in a nearby house. Slightly embarrassed, the man says to his wife, \"Well I feel bad. We'd better go knock on their door and offer to pay to replace the window.\" So, they put their game on hold and walk over to the house.\n\nThe man knocks on the door and waits a few seconds before hearing a male voice simply say, \"Enter!\" The couple walks in to a large, well-decorated house and stop in the entryway. They still don't see anyone or hear anyone speak, so the man says loudly, \"Uhh... Hello?\" The same voice is then heard from another room within the house saying, \"Take a right, and then a left, and then another right. There, you'll find me.\"\n\nSure enough, the husband and wife follow the man's directions and find the source of the voice. There in the middle of a large area rug within a beautiful living room sits a man. He is cross-legged on the floor wearing nothing but linen pants and a large turban. As they approach the man, the couple notices the golf ball had not only broken a picture window, but had then hit a decorative vase, which lie broken on the floor.\n\n\"My wife and I just came by so I could apologize for breaking your window and offer to pay to have it replaced,\" the man says, but is cut off. As the odd-looking man raises his hand and bows his head, he says, \"Do not fret. I am a genie, and I have been trapped inside this vase for 5,000 years. I am very grateful for having been released, so I will now grant you three wishes.\"\n\nExcitedly, the couple looked at one another and the man quickly piped up, \"I could used about 20 million bucks!\" to which the genie replied, \"It is done. Take this slip of paper. On it is written your new account number.\"\n\nThen, the woman says, \"I've always wanted a chateau on river in Paris!\" So the genie replied, \"It is done. Take this slip of paper. On it is written the address to your new home.\"\n\nNow, the two decided they should really think about their third wish. They began whispering off to the side about what they want it to be. Meanwhile, the genie asks, \"May I interject? I have been trapped inside that vase without the company of a woman for 5,000 years. I've already granted you $20 million and a beautiful home in Paris. Would you possibly be open to allowing me 30 minutes in the bedroom with your lovely wife?\" \n\nThe couple talks about it briefly, and eventually the man says, \"Well I'm getting a ton of money out of the deal, and my wife is getting her dream home, so we've decided that would be okay.\"\n\nSo, the genie and the woman go into the other room and come out 30 minutes later. As the genie finds his place on the floor once again, the couple promptly returns to discussing their third wish. After another short period, the genie chimes in once again, saying, \"Excuse me, if I may interrupt just one more time. How old are you sir?\" The man, slightly confused, replies, \"That's a weird question for a time like this, but I'm 29.\" Then the genie turns to the man's wife and asks, \"And you ma'am, how old are you?\" Visibly puzzled, she says, \"That's hardly an appropriate question to ask a lady, but I'm 27.\" \n\nTo this, the genie takes a moment to stand up from his seated position and says, \"Aren't you two a little old to believe in genies??\"",

        "body": "One day 3 farmers are coming back from town when they see a sign for the County Fair coming next month, right below the main advert is another for a Fattest Pig Contest. The farmers have pigs on their farm so they think they should enter. \n\nWhen they get back to the farm the first farmer goes \"Let's get the fattest pig we have\" the second says \"And lets feed him a lot every day till the competition\" the third one goes \"And let's plug him up back there with a cork to keep him from getting any skinnier\".\n\nSo the farmers get a cork, plug their fattest pig up back there and begin feeding him copious amounts of food every day for a month. When it's time for the competition, they load him up into the back of their truck (after much struggle) and drive to the fair grounds. As you might think, their pig is the biggest there by a mile and they win the contest.\n\nWhen they get back to the farm they realize they're kind of stuck with this really gigantic pig with a cork plugging it up and it looks like it's about to burst. They ask themselves who's going to be the one to unplug it. They all look at one another and say at the same \"Not me\". So they come up with the brilliant idea of buying a monkey and teaching it to unplug corks.\n\nSo they return to the fair ground and buy a monkey with some of their winnings from the contest. They start training it to uncork, on command, smaller things like wine bottles first, moving on to larger things like barrels. After a while they feel confident enough in their monkey's ability and take him and the pig outside to a large field.\n\nThey set the monkey next to the pig and first farmer says \"You know what, I'm going to stand 10 feet back for this.\" The second says \"Well I'm going to play it safer and stand 50 feet back.\" The third one goes \"And I'm going to play it even safer and stand 100 feet back.\"\n\nThe moment of truth comes and they give the command to the monkey to unplug the cork from the pig.\n\nThe farmer standing 100 feet back closes his eyes as the command is given. He hears a roaring sound like a waterfall and when he opens his eyes he sees he's standing up to his ankles in pig shit. He runs to the farmer who stood 50 feet back and he's up to his waist in pig shit. After digging him out they run to the farmer who stood only 10 feet back, and he's in pig shit up to his neck but he's laughing hysterically.\n\nHe keeps on laughing as they're digging him out they ask \"How could you be laughing so hard?\" \"Yeah, you're in pig shit up to your neck!\" to which he replies \"Yes, but you should've seen the look on the face of the monkey as he tried to put the cork back *in*!\"",

The man begins to search the dumpsters and look over the fences in the area. He calls out to see if anyone responds, only to notice the funerary box a few feet behind him.\nVisibly perturbed, the man begins to pick up his pace, but the thumping matches the tempo of his feet upon the ground.\nThe man pulls out his phone and opens the camera to look behind him while he walks, to discover that the pine box is \"hopping\" along with him, only a few steps behind. The man turns around and the thumping stops and the pall is stationary. The man opens the lid, but sees nothing.\nFrightened now, believing the crate to be a death omen, the man stumbles backwards and breaks into a run towards his house. The thumping becomes more rapid, and the man screams for help. Rounding the last corner and fumbling with his keys, the man makes it through the door of his house; locking it behind him and pulling out his phone to dial the authorities.\nThe sarcophagus breaks through the door as the man shakily dials the last number. In a panic, the man drops his phone and runs up the stairs, locking himself in the bathroom. The man hears a momentary pause in the thumping while he rifles through the cabinets, searching for anything to defend himself. The thumping grows ever closer, as the man realises there is nothing but a substantial metal tin of cough drops to defend him.\nThe man braces himself in the tub, as the box bursts through the door, swinging the lid open on its hinges as if to eat the man. He throws the tin into the pine curtain, and all of a sudden, with a sigh of relief;\nThe coffin stops.\n\nTL;DR it's a long build up to a pun",

They produced a piece of extremely thin wire. It was so thin that they could not even measure how thin it actually was. Not only that, but it was also durable. They could not cut or shorten it, no matter how hard they tried.\n\nThe Swiss Government was very proud of what their engineers created, but before they would go on and show off their newest development, they wanted to know how thin it actually was. They would look like fools if they could not even tell how thin their wire was, right? After some discussion, they decided that they had to ask a fellow European country for help.\n\nShould they ask the Germans? They are well known for their great engineering, they sure could help out. But they also liked to brag about that, so if they knew that the Swiss could not even measure it they would surely make fun of them. No, not the Germans. They decided to ask their French neighbours for help.\n\nSo they prepared a package, and added a note. \"Dear French Engineers. We have created a thin, durable wire. We can't cut it, and we can't measure how thin it is. Can you help?\". A week passed, two weeks, a month until they heard back. The French sent back the wire with a note of their own. \"We are very sorry. We tried everything, but we could neither cut it nor measure it.\"\n\nDamn, but it was worth a try. After more discussions, they decided to ask the USA next. After all they sent people to the moon and made many great inventions. They sure will find a way to help them out. They packed it, added the note, and send it over. A week passed, a month, two months until they heard back. Again, the wire was sent back to them with a note. \"We have no idea what to do. We tried everything, but we can't cut it. And our instruments are not precise enough to measure how thin it even is. We have to pass.\"\n\nThere was no other way. Swiss had to ask the Germans. But they hated it that, in the end, they had to admit it to them, of all people, that they could not measure the wire. So, angrily, they threw the wire in the box, didn't even bother to add a note, taped the package and send it to Germany.\n\nTwo days later the wire gets returned. In the box is a note by the Germans. \"We didn't know what you want us to do with it, so we drilled a hole through it and did some pipe threading\".\n\n\n_____________________________________\nThis is a translation of a German joke.

        "body": "A couple cursed with erratic work schedules and a long distance relationship finally found an opportunity to take a vacation together.\n\n\nFor their long desired vacation, they decided to visit the old capital by the coast. It was once the jewel of a sovereign kingdom alone, but due to an increase in overseas tourism, it is now an international culture center ruled by a plethora of performers and artists alike.\n\n\nHowever, the couple had been working for so long that they did not realize travel fares and passage tolls to the old capital had drastically increased. By the time they reached the city, they were already completely out of money. Holding on to hope as dearly as they held each other's hearts, they sat down by a river to think of a plan. Surely a shortage of money would not suffice to spoil their long awaited vacation.\n\n\nWatching passing troupes perform their trade, the wife comments, \"Dear, it seems making money here will be difficult. As our talentless selves, how could we ever hope to compete with the brilliance that we came here to witness?\"\n\n\nThe husband let out a short sigh. Turning his gaze toward an artist painting the river landscape, he ponders, \"Lest we waste our time with trivial tasks for a paltry sum, we'd better think of something. I'm so sorry, I should have better prepared for our precious time together.\"\n\n\n\"Do not fret, dear. None of this is your fault. We're blessed to even have this time together,\" the wife sullenly reassures her love.\n\n\nWith a bolt of inspiration striking him directly, the husband suddenly stands up. He exclaims with thunderous resolve, \"I've got it! I know of the perfect performance that only we can give to rival even the greatest spectacles gathered here today!\"\n\n\nAfter explaining his idea to his wife, she wholeheartedly agrees. Together, they set off to prepare for their act. By the goodwill of other performers, the couple manages to scrape up the necessary props. Now comes nightfall of their first day. Despite the chilling winds and dim light held only by scattered flames, the couple has no problems gathering an audience from the bustling old capital.\n\n\nBlindfolded, the husband greets the audience with a bow. Smiling, the wife curtsies in suit. In the midst of her gesture, the husband strikes an exaggerated pose, pulling a knife in each hand. Initially, this prompts scattered laughter to emerge from the audience. However, their chuckles are cut short when the husband chucks the knives toward his wife. \n\n\n\"Have you gone mad?!\" shouts a man. Indeed, it looked that way to many trained performers. His wife hadn't even finished taking her bow yet, and so starting the performance early is a dangerous feat.\n\n\nDespite the worried jeers, the bombardment carries on. The wife moves not a muscle as her husband performs again with a knife in each hand, then two, then four, and even eight. As the last set of blades whizzed by her gentle smile, she breaks out into a modest dance. The knives did not end here -- starting again with one in each hand, then two, then four, and eight. Through the treacherous rain, the wife manages to twirl and weave through, with nary a scratch.\n\n\nWhether it be by fear, bemusement, or amazement, the audience soon became thoroughly entranced. \n\n\nSignaling the end of her dance with a hard step, the husband throws all of his remaining daggers into the air, arcing towards the love of his life. The couple once again faces the stage and takes a bow, with silence cut only by the thick thud of each landing blade.\n\n\nWith a momentary pause, the audience begins to erupt into an applause. Many with mouth agape, they can't believe what they had just witnessed. \n\n\n\"Wait!\" a shrill voice cries. A young boy at the front points out the actions of the wife. As spectators fall into horror yet again, the wife finishes tying her blindfold, still warm from the efforts of her loved one. The warmth of the band is overshadowed by the searing flames flickering just above her hands. A blazing hand-and-a-half sword unsheathed, a novice stance, and an unarmored husband stand on the stage. \n\n\nA single step from the man signals the beginning of his wife's onslaught. She charges at him, flailing the weapon every which way. The husband fearlessly continues to stand in her way, going so far as to place himself in the trajectory of her swings. The light scent of embers permeate the plaza.\n\n\nAs if by foresight, the woman somehow manages to avoid slaying her husband, beautifully dancing just as she was previously, but now even more dangerously. Now convinced that the husband and wife are no amateurs, the crowd overcomes anxiety and begins to cheer. Flourishing wildly, the flames reach out to savor the flesh of the husband, to no avail.\n\n\nFinally, the wife hurls the sword at her husband to free her hands. With a quick draw of two matchlock pistols, she fires at eye-level. The lead bullets barely fail to graze her husband's ears as he extinguishes the blade. Unscathed, the couple again takes a bow, with the wife facing the wrong direction. Amidst a roar of laughter and cheering, the couple catches their breath. Bathing in coin and praise, they were acknowledged as stars freshly fallen from the night sky.\n\n\nDuring the public banquet, several performers approach the couple to discuss the performance. Just as many were in awe as they were curious. Everyone was shocked when the couple insisted that none of it took much practice.\n\n\n\"How did you two manage to do it?\" inquires a man, blue still smeared across his hands. \"I noticed both of you at the river earlier today. You're both tourists, and neither of you had time to practice your routine, yes? Yet, everything was executed so perfectly. Neither of you are even slightly hurt! Pray tell us, how did you do it?\"\n\n\nThe painter's testimony piques the interest of all nearby. The crowd falls into silence, waiting for the couple's response. With interlocking arms, entwined fingers, and closed eyes, the couple takes a moment to think of an answer. \n\n\nFinally, the wife opens her eyes and takes a breath. With her signature smile, she begins to speak.\n\n\n\"Well, we figured we've been apart from each other for so long, that we would always miss each other.\"",

Sure enough, the day after the lady's sign now read \"7 francs\".\nThis went on for a while, until eventually one of the lady's customers pointed to the sign and said, \"Madame, you cannot keep your prices so low for long. These big companies can use their buying power to sell products cheaper, but a little store like yours can never compete.\"\nIn response, the old lady bent forward conspiratorially and muttered, \"Monsieur, I don't even sell butter.\"",

When you notice\nthis, try not to yell at them. Some are\noversensitive, and there's nothing worse than an\noversensitive woman.\n\nMy name is Ron.\nLet me relate how I handled the situation\nwith my wife. When I retired a few years\nago, it became necessary for Carol Anne to get a\nfull-time job, along with her part-time job,\nboth for extra income and for the health\nbenefits that we needed. Shortly after she\nstarted working, I noticed she was beginning to\nshow her age. I usually get home from the\ngolf club about the same time she gets home from\nwork.\n\nAlthough she knows how hungry I am,\nshe almost always says she has to rest for half\nan hour or so before she starts dinner. I\ndon't yell at her. Instead, I tell her to\ntake her time and just wake me when she gets\ndinner on the table. I generally have\nlunch in the Men's Grill at the club, so eating\nout is not reasonable. I'm ready for some\nhome-cooked grub when I hit that door. She\nused to do the dishes as soon as we finished\neating. But now it's not unusual for them\nto sit on the table for several hours after\ndinner.\n\nI do what I can by diplomatically\nreminding her several times each evening that\nthey won't clean themselves. I know she\nreally appreciates this, as it does seem to\nmotivate her to get them done before she goes to bed.\n\nAnother symptom of aging is\ncomplaining, I think.For example, she will say\nthat it is difficult for her to find time to pay\nthe monthly bills during her lunch hour.\nBut, Boys, we take 'em for better or\nworse, so I just smile and offer encouragement.\nI tell her to stretch it out over two, or\neven three days. That way, she won't have\nto rush so much. I also remind her that\nmissing lunch completely now and then wouldn't\nhurt her any (if you know what I mean). I\nlike to think tact is one of my strong points.\n\nWhen doing simple jobs, she seems\nto think she needs more rest periods. She\nhad to take a break when she was only\nhalf-finished mowing the yard. I try not\nto make a scene. I'm a fair man. I\ntell her to fix herself a nice, big, cold glass\nof freshly squeezed lemonade and just sit for a\nwhile. And, as long as she is making one\nfor herself, she may as well make one for me,\ntoo.\n\nI know that I probably look like a\nsaint in the way I support my wife. I'm\nnot saying that showing this much consideration\nis easy. Many men will find it difficult.\nSome will find it impossible! Nobody knows\nbetter than I do how frustrating women get as\nthey get older. However, Guys, even if you\njust use a little more tact and less criticism\nof your aging wife because of this article, I\nwill consider that writing it was well\nworthwhile. After all, we are put on this\nearth to help each other.\n\n\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE:\nRon\ndied suddenly on January 31 of a perforated\nrectum. The police report says he was\nfound with a Calloway extra-long 50-inch Big\nBertha Driver II golf club jammed up his rear\nend, with barely 5 inches of grip showing, and a\nsledge hammer laying nearby. His wife\nwas arrested and charged with murder.\nThe all-woman jury took only 10 minutes to\nfind her Not Guilty, accepting her defense that\nRon, somehow without looking, accidentally sat\ndown on his golf club.\n",

Understanding how important the relationship with\nthem was, the CEO of the company assembled his top people. They decided to\nhire an external engineering company to solve their empty boxes problem. The\nproject followed the usual process: budget and project sponsor allocated,\nRFP, and third-parties selected.  Six months (and $8 million) later they had\na fantastic solution - on time, on budget, and high quality. Everyone in\nthe project was pleased.\n\nThey solved the problem by using a high-tech precision scale that would\nsound a bell and flash lights whenever a toothpaste box weighed less than it\nshould. The line would stop, someone would walk over, remove the defective\nbox, and then press another button to re-start the line. As a result of the\nnew package monitoring process, no empty boxes were being shipped out of the\nfactory.\n\nWith no more customer complaints, the CEO felt the $8 million was well\nspent. He then reviewed the line statistics report and discovered the number\nof empty boxes picked up by the scale in the first week was consistent with\nprojections, however, the next three weeks were zero! The estimated rate\nshould have been at least a dozen boxes a day. He had the engineers check\nthe equipment, they verified the report as accurate.\n\nPuzzled, the CEO traveled down to the factory, viewed the part of the line\nwhere the precision scale was installed, and observed just ahead of the new\n$8 million dollar solution sat a $20 desk fan blowing the empty boxes off\nthe belt and into a bin. He asked the line supervisor what that was about.\n\n\n\"Oh, that,\" the supervisor replied, \"Bert, the kid from maintenance, put it\nthere because he was tired of walking over, removing the box and re-starting\nthe line every time the bell rang.\"\n",

Relax and enjoy yourself.\"  \n\nThe Sergeant Major just stared at her in his serious manner.  \n\nFinally the young lady said, \"You know, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but when is the last time you had sex?\" \n\nThe Sergeant Major looked at her and replied, \"1955.\"  \n\nShe said, \"Well, there you are.  You really need to chill out and quit taking everything so seriously! I mean, no sex since 1955!

At the last second, the water parts, allowing the ball to roll up on the green.  The old guy takes the tee, and just like his paying partners he too hits the ball in the drink.  His ball, however, slowly sinks to the bottom.  As it is sinking, a passing fish sees the ball and swallows it.  The fish then swims to the surface, where he is spied by a passing eagle.  The eagle grabs the fish and flies off.  As he flies over the green the fish somehow manages to poop the ball out, and it goes in the cup for a hole-in-one.\n\nAt this point, Jesus and Moses turn to the old guy and say \"OK, God; are going to fuck around, or are you going to play golf?\"",

So, on his ninth birthday, Jimmy was ecstatic to hear that his parents were taking him on a safari! \n\nOn the day before he was due to leave, Jimmy had a playdate with his friends. When their parents came to pick them up, Jimmy's mother wanted to boast about her son's hobby.\n\n\"Jimmy,\" she called, \"Come and tell your friend's mother where you're going tomorrow.\"\n\nJimmy came running into the foyer.

As they left, there were murmurs of \"such deplorable behavior\" and \"what awful parenting\". Jimmy's mother and father were dumbfounded. \"How could he do this?\" they asked. \"We've never said such words in our lives!

The mother and father looked at each other, and put their arms around Jimmy's shoulders. \"Listen, son,\" they said. \"Where did you really hear that word?\"\n\n\"From you,\" he said, bewildered.\n\n\"Now, why would we ever say that?\" they insisted, to which their son replied, \"You told it to me on my birthday.\" They sighed. \"Jimmy, look, whether we said it or not, that word is very inappropriate. We love you, and we don't want you getting in trouble.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Jimmy said. The rest of the flight was calm and quiet.\n\nWhen they finally arrived, Jimmy rushed out of the plane. \"Yay!\" he exclaimed rushing toward the safari park, located near the airport.

David asks: \"How much do they cost sir?\" 1 euro the man said. David ran home as fast as he could. When david arrived he saw he only had 50 cents. He went to his mother to ask for money. His mother said: \"If you clean my sewing machine you can have 50 cents. David opened the sewing machine made it clean and put it back together. He ran back to the market with his money. When he came back to the stand he asked how much they cost to be sure. The man replied 1 euro and 50 cents. David was shocked but didn't argue and ran back home. He went to his father to gain 50 cents. His father agreed to give 50 cents if \nhe would wash his car engine. So David agrees and he opened the engine washed it and put all the pieces together. The father gave David his well deserved 50 cents and David ran back to the market stand. David asked the man how much the beautiful pink shoes costs. The man answered: 1 euro and 50 cents please. David bought the shoes full of excitement. David ran back home and walks up stairs. he closes his room door and started pulling of his shoes and socks, while the door rang. He doesn't want anyone to see his new shoes so he put on his old shoes and socks and ran to the door. David opens the door and sees a man with a black suit and a black briefcase. The man said: \"Im so sorry, but your mother has passed away in the hospital. Her sewingmachine electrocuted her. David is a bit sad but in his mind he is all about his new pair of pink shoes. He closes the door and runs back to his room as fast as he can. He started pulling his shoes and socks of again. But the door rang for the second time. David puts his shoes and socks back on and ran downstairs. He opens the door and the same man stand in front of him and he sais: 'Im so sorry, I have never seen this before but also your father as been found dead. His car exploded when he tried to start it.\". David knows he did something wrong but he needs to see his new schoes in action. So he rushes back to his room and when he finally put them on the door rang again. David walks down a bit irritated (with his new beautiful pink shoes on) and opens the door.

However, we found none of these things in your car.\" \n\nThe man replies, \"Yeah, and I bet that liar said I was speeding too!",

Now I want you to go to your room and you are to stay there for TWO HOURS. When you come out, you may play with your train, but I want you to use nice language.\"  Two hours later, the son comes out of the bedroom and resumes playing with his train. Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say, \"All passengers who are disembarking from the train, please remember to take all of your belongings with you. We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon.\"  She hears the little boy continue, \"For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat. Remember, there is no smoking on the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us today.\"  As the mother began to smile, the child added, \"For those of you who are pissed off about the TWO HOUR delay, please see the b*tch in the kitchen.\"",

He wants to make his kingdom into a sovereign nation but unfortunately they do not have the infrastructure, population, or economy to do so. In fact, this small state is only known for a single export. Thanks to their proximity to some of the finest gold and other metals in the world but total lack of an ability to process those metals on a mass scale, they have been left with only one option. You know the saying; when life hands you lemons, make lemonade. Make lemonade they did. This tiny territory is renowned for creating the highest quality watches in the world. No expense is spared and their elite group of craftsmen train for their entire lives from childhood to produce these terrific timepieces. Men of great wealth and taste have been known to trade entire fortunes for just a single one of these watches; that is how valuable they are.\n\nThe king knows this and he knows that only a small portion of his populace can ever hope to become one of the respected elite, let alone hold one of their masterpieces in their own hands. Being a very just and fair man, the king ordered the most senior watchmaker in the land to create something the likes of which had never been seen. A watch of such great craftsmanship so as to be above monetary value. The man labored long and hard for many nights to produce the king's watch. When he at last presented the completed work to his lord - in front of the entire nation, no less - he was met with thunderous applause and a warm embrace. He had done it! The king then made a shocking announcement.\n\n\"This masterpiece belongs to my people!\"\n\nWhen the roaring of the crowd died down he continued.\n\n\"This watch shall be a symbol of my love for all of you. Though I rule over you with supreme authority I do not wish a single one of you to feel that you do not have a voice in the ruling of this nation. From this day on let anyone who doubts my decisions or questions my judgment wear this watch and stand as my equal to voice their concerns. Should even a single one of you think me unfair or wrong in any matter then simply come to my castle and I will present you this token of good faith.\"\n\nThe king made good on his word and from that day on all citizens knew they held the right to challenge their king's rulings. Over time the watch became a symbol of fairness throughout the land. Anyone who wore it could speak plainly to their ruler.\n\nIt was the \"don't believe me just\" watch.",

The bird he passed along the way was the forger's homing vulture, which was en route to the forger's publisher to make a delivery. Unfortunately, the poor bird had to fly down the stairwell to ground level and out the open terrace since the forger's apartment had no windows. She was carrying some rolled up paper on which her owner had written the perfect end to his prized short story, what's delivery was a mission of utmost importance.\n\nYou see, the forger was very proud of this story's ending as it unabashedly mocked the last two novellas in a complete collection written by his far more successful literary rival, Condolyssa Blackburn, who had worked to expose the forger's dishonesty by high-hatting his private dealings in said novellas, of which the forger grew thirsty for revenge. This same short story would later assist the forger in framing her for a homicide.\nSo, the swindler in the stairwell knew of the forger's vulture, but he hated birds and went about swatting and cursing at her for flying around in the building. Though, little did the swindler realize that there was a third crook who had been hiding in the shadows of the stairwell above him. As the swindler rounded the corner and came into view, the young thief named Khan had already lept from the banister one floor up behind the swindler as he planned to knock the swindler down and take his money.\n\nAs was indicative of his inexperience, young Khan did not notice the vulture until after he lept from the banister as he was too busy marking the swindler to notice the large bird flying past him on it's way down. The sight of the dutiful bird had caused the swindler to stop and swat and curse, which completely negated Khan's calculated leap, so as he fell toward where the swindler would have been had it not been for the vulture, he joined the swindler in cursing wildly at the bird because she had single-wingedly ruined his plan.\n\nKhan's midair cursing fit caught the attention of the swindler who sighted him, and since Khan was quite green and merely half his age, the swindler immediately began talking down to him, attempting to illustrate how feeble and worthless his attempt to swindle a swindler. Yet, as the swindler turned to continue his ascent upstairs, his pride had hindered him from noticing that Khan had successfully picked the wallet from his back pocket.\n\nThus, Khan's incredibly embarrassing, albeit successful, incident is now humorously referred to among his fellow con men as the \"greatest con ever botched,\" which is far less mentally demanding than what it was formerly referred to as, which was the *\"condescending conned ascending con dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes ending condescending Khan's descending on dissenting conned ascending con dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes sending condescending Khan descending condescending condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes ending condescending conned ascending con's dissenting on dissenting condor-sending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes sending condescending conned ascending con's dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes on descending condescending Khan's descending\" con.*\n\n\nthis was stolen from /u/shigglesmcwhigley",

Otherwise, you will get thrown straight to Hell.\"\n\nThe first guy starts climbing, and God pulled out one of those Yo Mama jokes. He couldn't hold his laughter and gets thrown all the way down. The second guy starts climbing and God starts off with the same joke. There was no reaction. God cranked up his humour game and by the 3rd joke, the second guy burst out laughing, and gets sent straight down.\n\nThe third guy starts climbing, with a serious face as God throws joke after joke at him. He maintains his serious expression as he heads up the stairs. Finally at the very last step, he burst out laughing. \n\nDown in hell, the first 2 guys asked him, \"You were so close! Why couldn't you hold it in for one more step?\"\n\nThe 3rd guy was puzzled. \"Oh, I finally understood the first joke.\"",

I felt bad for her, really, cause she was carrying all of this heavy stuff on her own. In my head, and I don't know what I was thinking considering I'm like a 6/10 at my best, I decided I'd at least try to give her a hand. I went over to her, said \"Hey, I noticed you don't have any help. You need someone else to move these boxes inside?\"\n\nShe looks me straight in the face with this disgusting glare and says. \"Yeah, I'm good, thanks.\" I'm not sure what I was expecting, but that even shocked me a little bit. Contrary to my own nature, I just told her that if she needed help after all she could just come knock on my door. She went through with the move by herself and I didn't hear from her for a couple days.\n\nThat is until I hear a knock at my door. When I open up to see who it is, sure enough, it's 9/10 girl right there, and apparently she wants to talk to me. She says \"I'm really sorry about how bitchy I was back when you tried to help me. Let me make it up to you and take you out to dinner.\" Woah. After all that, she actually comes to ME for a date. So I counteroffer, tell her that we should also go watch a movie in return for me paying for the dinner, and she goes along with it just fine.\n\nWe got together and things were going GREAT! Maybe we weren't very compatible, cause I'm into anime and video games but while she was into Starbucks and Mean Girls and white girl shit like that. Still, our relationship had this weird formula... It just worked, somehow, and it worked incredibly well.\n\nA month after we started dating, I noticed another moving truck, this time at the house across the street from me. Once again, I noticed a girl moving in. Now, this girl isn't as hot as my girlfriend. If I had to rate her, I'd give her a 7/10. Still, she was on her own, and chivalrous me went to go offer help again.\n\nShe was VERY open to getting help, and instantly handed me a box that was heavy as all hell. I felt like Atlas carrying the Earth, that's how heavy it was. But when I realized the box said \"Video Games\" on it, I knew I was in for some shit. Opened it up, saw a bunch of SERIOUS fucking video games in there, not any stupid 'girl gamer' nonsense. I'm talking NES cartridges, PC games, two entire consoles, controllers. I asked her \"Is this your boyfriend's stuff?\" and just as quickly as she had accepted my help, she told me she didn't have a boyfriend and it was all hers.\n\nAnyway, I helped her moving everything else out of the van and almost immediately after we just hung out at her house. It was fun as hell, man. Hadn't felt that I had a good friend like that for a long time. Couple weeks go by and my girlfriend starts to notice how much me and this new girl have been hanging out. My girlfriend came up to me and said, \"Sorry, I have problems with jealousy and I just don't really want you hanging out with her. You're spending a lot of time with her and I want you to spend more time with me.\"\n\nHearing this from her was UNBELIEVABLE. A girl this fucking beautiful getting jealous over something I did! Either way, I told her that because me and the other girl were so similar that they would definitely like each other. She agrees, although reluctantly, and comes back to me later.\n\nShe says \"Yeah, you can't see her anymore. She told me that if she ever sees me and you together she will fucking murder me and that you belong to her.\" I was in disbelief because it doesn't even match her personality to say something like that, but I insisted that there was no way it was real, and yet she continued to push it, and for some reason she sounded really convincing. \"That's literally what she said, she said she'll fucking kill me!\"\n\n\"I can't imagine it's that serious.\" I said, \"Let me go and talk to her so I can figure this out.\"\n\nI went to the house of the 7/10 girl and knocked on the door. No response. Waited, called her, no answer. Okay, fine. Called my girlfriend to tell her I'll try to get in contact tomorrow, no answer. Go to my girlfriend's house, knock on the door, and again there is no answer. This goes on for a couple weeks with no luck, and I'm left clueless as to what is going on. I file missing persons reports for both of them, neither of them get found.\n\nI'm only left guessing. Did they run away together? Is this some horrible coincidence? I didn't know, and at the time it seemed as if I had no way of knowing.\n\nI give up hoping.\n\nBut one day, I turned on the news and couldn't believe my eyes. I witnessed footage of 7/10 girl getting taken away in handcuffs, soaked completely in blood. She's raging at the cameras, yelling at me about how she's gonna come and kill me next.\n\nAutopsy reports come out, and it becomes apparent that not only did the 7/10 girl murder my girlfriend like she said she would, but that parts of my girlfriend's body were missing. It appears that chunks of flesh from her body were ingested by none other than the killer herself.\n\nI mourned for my beautiful girlfriend for some time, but then I reflected on the footage I watched on the news. I knew that she was coming for me, and I couldn't run for long. I locked myself in my home, covering windows and reinforcing them, putting multiple locks on every entrance I could just to keep her out. I broke down, crying myself to sleep at night, screaming at walls, becoming a paranoid mess as my sanity slipped away, until one day, I realized...\n\nI realized the point of it all. It dawned on me, finally, the purpose of my entire experience, and in my fits of madness and screaming, my moment of sudden realization, I screamed...\n\n\"WHY WAS SIX AFRAID OF SEVEN?\"",

The government is in a panic trying to figure out what to do to decide who the next president will be. Finally, Barack Obama comes up with an idea: a literal presidential race. The three candidates would run a lap around the White House and the person with the best time would become president. Bernie Sanders goes first, but being as old as he is, he takes about 24 minutes. Trump goes next and arrives with a time of 14:26. Hillary Clinton goes last, running as fast as she can, trampling the flowers and shrubs in her way in an effort to beat Trump's time. She finally crosses the finish line at just under ten minutes. \n\n\"Aha!\" She exclaims, \"That must be some kind of record!\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" says Obama, \"Bush did 9:11\"",

At the top there are the king and queen Cheerios, next come the noble Cheerios, then the night Cheerios who are responsible for law enforcement in the land, then come the peasant Cheerios who are somewhat oppressed but work hard and get by, and then there are the gangster Cheerios who break the rules and steal from other hard working Cheerios. Some gangster Cheerios however were born into the gangster Cheerios cast, and want nothing more than to live an honest life, unfortunately, everyone, even the peasant Cheerios look down on them.\nOne day, a young gangster cheerio who wanted to escape his cast, decided he wanted a friend who was not a gangster cheerio to hang out with. So he went to the peasant Cheerios, and knocked on the door. A peasant cheerio answered, and said \"hello gangster cheerio, how can I help you?\" The gangster cheerio responded \"hi peasant cheerio, I was wondering if you wanted to be friends with me\" the peasant cheerio said \"look, I'm sorry gangster cheerio, but if the knight Cheerios found out that I was friends with a gangster cheerio, they would have me locked up.\" The gangster cheerio responds \"that's okay, I understand\" and walks home, a little put out.\n\nThe next day, he wakes up, puts on his brave face, and goes out into the country in search of a knight cheerio. He sees one a little ways off and goes over to talk to him. Excuse me, knight cheerio? I was wondering if you wanted tone friends with me\" he said in a hopeful voice. The knight cheerio turned around, looked him up and down, and, with his nose in the air, said \"Gangster cheerio, I should really arrest you right now, but I'll let you off easy, get out of my line of sight, and I won't have to cuff you.\" So gangster cheerio walked on home, a little dejected.\n\nThe next day, gangster cheerio decided to venture up to the nobles mansion, he hiked up to the front doors, and looked at how fancy it all was, then he wrong the bell. A nobleman cheerio answered, took one look at the gangster cheerio, and slammed the door in his face. Gangster cheerio went home really depressed that night.\n\nThe next day gangster cheerio was nervous, today was when he would visit the king, and this was his last chance to make a friend. He trekked on up to the royal palace, and knocked on the door. He was shown in and asked to wait in the sitting room. A few moments later, the king cheerio entered the room. \"King cheerio\" said the gangster cheerio \"will you be friends with me?\" \"Of course I'll be friends with you\" responded the king cheerio. The gangster cheerio was elated.\n\"So\" said the king cheerio \"what do you want to do now that we are friends, we could either go to the circus, or go to the fair\"\n\"I would like to go to the circus\" said the gangster cheerio. The king pulls out his iPhone and checks four square.\n\"Well\" he says \"there are a thousand people at the circus, but only dive hundred at the fair\"\nAlright then, let's go to the fair\" says the gangster cheerio\nSo they went to the fair and decide they want to go on a ride, there is a roller coaster and a Ferris wheel.\n\"Do you want to go on the roller coaster, or the Ferris wheel?\" Asks the king\n\"I would like to go on the Ferris wheel\" says the gangster cheerio\nSo the king checks four square\n\"There are four hundred people in line at the Ferris wheel, but only two hundred in line at the roller coaster\" he says\n\"Alright then, let's do the roller coaster\" says the gangster cheerio\nThey ride the roller coaster, get off, and decide they are kind of hungry.

There is root beer and punch available.\n\"Do you want root beer or punch!\" Asks the king\n\"I would like root beer\" says the gangster cheerio\nSo the king pulls out his phone, checks four square and sees that there are five people in line for the root beer,\nBut there's no punch line!",

So you end up putting toilet paper between your ass and your underwear so you don't ruin them with those dreadful skid marks.   \n\nThe Second Wave Shit  This shit happens when you've finished, your pants are up to your knees, and you suddenly realize you have to shit some more.   \n\nThe Brain Hemorrahage Through Your Nose Shit  Also known as \"Pop a Vein in Your Forehead Shit\". You have to strain so much to get it out that you turn purple and practically have a stroke.\n\nThe Corn Shit  No explanation necessary.   \n\nThe Lincoln Log Shit  The kind of shit that's so enormous you're afraid to flush it down without first breaking it up into little pieces with the toilet brush.   \n\nThe Nororius Drinker Shit  The kind of shit you have the morning after a long night of drinking. It's most noticeable trait is the tread mark left on the bottom of the toilet bowl after you flush.   \n\nThe \"Gee, I Really Wish I Could Shit\" Shit  The kind where you want to shit, but even after straining your guts out, all you can do is sit on the toilet, cramped and farting.   \n\nThe Wet Cheeks Shit  Also known as the \"Power Dump\". That's the kind that comes out of your ass so fast that your butt cheeks get splashed with the toilet water.   \n\nThe Liquid Shit  That's the kind where yellowish-brown liquid shoots out of your butt, splashes all over the side of the toilet bowl and, at the same time, chronically burns your tender poop-chute.   \n\nThe Mexican Food Shit  A class all on its own.   \n\nThe Crowd Pleaser  This shit is so intriguing in size and/or appearance that you have to show it to someone before flushing.   \n\nThe Mood Enhancer  This shit occurs after a lengthy period of constipation, thereby allowing you to be your old self again.   \n\nThe Ritual  This shit occurs at the same time each day and is accomplished with the aid of a newspaper.   \n\nThe Guinness Book Of Records Shit  A shit so noteworthy it should be recorded for future generations.   \n\nThe Aftershock Shit  This shit has an odour so powerful than anyone entering the vicinity within the next seven hours is affected.   \n\nThe \"Honeymoon's Over\" Shit  This is any shit created in the presence of another person.   \n\nThe Groaner  A shit so huge it cannot exit without vocal assistance.   \n\nThe Floater  Characterized by its floatability, this shit has been known to resurface after many flushings.   \n\nThe Ranger  A shit which refuses to let go. It is usually necessary to engage in a rocking or bouncing motion, but quite often the only solution is to push it away with a small piece of toilet paper.   \n\nThe Phantom Shit  This appears in the toilet mysteriously and no one will admit to putting it there.   \n\nThe Peek-A-Boo Shit  Now you see it, now you don't. This shit is playing games with you. Requires patience and muscle control.   \n\nThe Bombshell  A shit that comes as a complete surprise at a time that is either inappropriate to shit (i.e. during lovemaking or a root canal) or you are nowhere near shitting facilities.   \n\nThe Snake Charmer  A long skinny shit which has managed to coil itself into a frightening position - usually harmless.   \n\nThe Olympic Shit  This shit occurs exactly one hour prior to the start of any competitive event in which you are entered and bears a close resemblance to the Drinker's Shit.   \n\nThe Back-To-Nature Shit  This shit may be of any variety but is always deposited either in the woods or while hiding behind the passenger side of your car.   \n\nThe Pebbles-From-Heaven Shit  An adorable collection of small turds in a cluster, often a gift from God when you actually can't shit.   \n\nPremeditated Shit  Laxative induced. Doesn't count.   \n\nShitzopherenia  Fear of shitting - can be fatal!   \n\nEnergizer Vs. Duracell Shit  Also known as a \"Still Going\" shit.   \n\nThe Power Dump Shit  The kind that comes out so fast, you barely get your pants down when you're done.   \n\nThe Liquid Plumber Shit  This kind of shit is so big it plugs up the toilet and it overflows all over the floor. (You should have followed the advice from the Lincoln Log Shit.)   \n\nThe Spinal Tap Shit  The kind of shit that hurts so much coming out, you'd swear it's got to be coming out sideways.   \n\nThe \"I Think I'm Giving Birth Through My Asshole\" Shit  Similar to the Lincoln Log and The Spinal Tap Shits. The shape and size of the turd resembles a tall boy beer can. Vacuous air space remains in the rectum for some time afterwards.   \n\nThe Porridge Shit  The type that comes out like toothpaste, and just keeps on coming. You have two choices: a) flush and keep going, or B) risk it piling up to your butt while you sit there helpless.   \n\nThe \"I'm Going To Chew My Food Better\" Shit  When the bag of Doritos you ate last night lacerates the insides of your rectum on the way out in the morning.   \n\nThe \"I Think I'm Turning Into A Bunny\" Shit  When you drop lots of cute, little round ones that look like marbles and make tiny splashing sounds when they hit the water.   \n\nThe \"What The Hell Died In Here?\" Shit  Also sometimes referred to as \"The Toxic Dump\". Of course you don't warn anyone of the poisonous bathroom odor. Instead, you stand innocently near the door and enjoy the show as they run out gagging and gasping for air.   \n\n\nThe \"I Just Know There's A Turd Still Dangling There\" Shit  Where you just sit there patiently and wait for the last cling-on to drop off because if you wipe now, it's going to smear all over the place.",

He was a quiet fellow who loved to walk the beach when he had some time to spare. He was the kind of guy you wouldn't mind having a drink with, but anything more might be tedious. One day, as Benny was walking the beach, he stumbled over a small black jar-shaped object. Benny curiously picked it up and began to brush off the sand.\n\n*Woosh*\n\nBenny winced as sand flew into his eyes, blinding him temporarily. By the time he opened his eyes, a shadow had been cast over him.\n\n**\"I AM KHALROG, GENIE OF THE URN, YOU HAVE AWOKEN ME FROM MY SLUMBER. WHAT IS YOUR ONE TRUE DESIRE?\"** the genie bellowed.\n\nStunned, Benny could hardly believe what he was seeing. Benny thought for a moment as he regained his senses. Then he began to speak, \"Well, I've always wanted a magnificent beard. I've always had a hard time with the ladies and I hear great beards are a wonderful attraction.\"\n\n**\"VERY WELL,\"** replied the genie, **\"YOU MAY HAVE YOUR BEARD. HOWEVER, I MUST WARN YOU THAT THIS BEARD COMES AT A PRICE: YOU MUST NEVER SHAVE IT OFF.\"**\n\nBenny thought for a moment, then agreed to the genie's conditions. A brilliant beard protruded from Benny's chin and grew and grew until finally it reached his belly. This was fantastic! Surely he would be a ladies' man now!\n\nYears passed by as Benny became an icon of beard lovers everywhere. He won contest after contest and seducing women had never been easier. Then one day, he met the woman of his dreams. They went on several dates together before she revealed to him that she would love nothing else than to see him without his beard. Benny loved his beard, but he loved this woman much more. Reluctantly, he agreed to shave it off in the morning.\n\nThe next morning, Benny grabbed his razor and started to shave his beard.\n\n\n*POOF*\n\n\nSuddenly, Benny was teleported into a round, black room!\n\n\"Egad!\" Benny cried. \"Where am I!?\"\n\n**\"YOU HAVE DISOBEYED THE ONE RULE, BENNY,\"** a voice behind him roared.\n\nBenny stammered, \"But I... I... it's only a beard! Why are you doing this to me?\"\n\nThe genie replied, **\"I AM THE GENIE OF THE URN, BENNY. I HAVE RULES. WHEN THOSE RULES ARE BROKEN, YOU MUST BE PUNISHED.\"**\n\n\"So... so... what's my... my punishment then?\" Benny stuttered.\n\n**\"YOU WILL REMAIN HERE IN MY URN FOR ALL ETERNITY AND THE WORLD WILL KNOW YOUR FAULTS.\"** the genie exclaimed.\n\n\nAnd from that day forth, Benny has taught all Bennys everywhere the most important lesson of all:\n\n\n>*A Benny shaved is a Benny urned.*",

Being a helpful guy, John tells him there's a new robot in a store down the road that, if you pour your urine into it and insert a dollar bill, it will diagnose any illness that you may have. Hardly believing what he was told, Bob pees into the cup and goes to the store to check it out for himself. Sure enough, there was this robot all new and shiny. So he inserts a dollar bill, and pours his urine into a special receptacle. The robot starts beeping, and seconds later prints out a piece of paper that reads. \n\n\"You have a simple sprain. Put a cold compress on your arm and avoid heavy lifting, and your arm will get better in a week\" \n\nBob is amazed at how advanced technology has become, and immediately starts thinking about ways to beat the robot. When he gets home, he shares the news with his wife and daughter and asks them to pee into the cup, to which they happily oblige. He then walks over to the kitty litter box, picks up the poop and places it into the cup with the urine. He then mixes the concoction with tap water and for good measure, beats one off right into the cup. The next day he returns to the store, inserts a dollar bill, and pours his entire concoction into the receptacle. After the customary beeps, the robot prints out an even longer piece of paper. It reads: \n\n\" 1.Your tap water has too much iron. Buy a filter. \n\n  2.Your cat has worms. Take it to a vet. \n\n 3.Your daughter shoots up heroin. Take her to rehab ASAP. \n\n 4.Your wife is pregnant, and you're not the father. Get a good lawyer. \n\n 5.And lastly, if you don't stop jerking off, your arm will never get better\"",

He had tractor models, tractor wallpaper, remote control miniature tractors, tractor board games, even some tractor porn(which is not easy to find mind you). The only thing that even came close to his love for tractors, was the love he felt for his wife. His high school sweetheart, who didn't mind his infatuation with tractors one bit. She didn't even mind the role play where she would dress as a tractor, he would dress as a farmer, and he would take her for a \"ride\". Sadly his wife was struck one day, a tractor fell off the back of a transport truck. She didn't die until he was at her side in the hospital. Her dying words \"don't blame the tractor honey\" and with that she headed to the big farm in the sky. Sadly, he did blame the tractor, he hated them now with all his mind, body, and soul. He went home and destroyed ALL his tractor related items, the toys, his wifes tractor suit, and even his collection of tractor porn. He put it all in a pile and burned it in the yard. What ever didn't burn enough to his liking was thrown into a woodchipper. He then went inside, rarely leaving his home, for 8 years. Finally on the 8th anniversary of his darling wifes death he decided it was time to get back out in the dating world, plus the cute cashier at the grocery store had been asking him out for a while now, he called her out to dinner. The restaurant he choose ended up being quite nice, good food, good service, great decor. But there was one problem, it was EXTREMELY smoky. So smoky that his date, being an asthmatic, was having some trouble breathing. After noticing her displeasure, and trouble breathing, he started breathing in. I mean REALLY breathing in. Inhaling with such force that all the smoke quickly left the dining room, and went into his lungs. When the room was void of smoke he stepped outside and released it all into the night. When he rejoined his date she asked \"how on earth did you do that?\" to which he replied, \"I'm an extractor fan.\"",

Later on the farmer pulls his nephew aside and explains\n\n\"James, that was a bull, not a cow and that word, the f-word, isn't anything you should be saying at your age, and it's best to avoid saying it at all if you can. If you see something like that again, say 'surprising' instead, I'll get your meaning\"\n\nThe boy nods and goes on enjoying the countryside and his uncle's farm. Closer to sundown the boy rushes into the living room again and exclaims \"Uncle Johnathan, Uncle Johnathan! There's a bull surprising the cows!\" the farmer nods and replies \"Thank you for telling me Jimmy, but that's a common thing on a  farm\" the boy incredulously asks \"It's common for a bull to fuck a  horse?!\"",

In New York they get on a train bound for the wild west. Once there, they find themselves having the best of times. But soon they're broke. All they had was either gambled, whored or drunk away.\nWith their last, they find themselves sitting at the bar in a saloon drinking.\nPaddy looks to Maddy and says, \"Maddy we're fook'd. We're fookin' broke... What're we gonna do?\"\nTo which Maddy replies, \"I've got no fookin' idea Paddy.\"\nNo sooner has Maddy replied when the swing-doors of the saloon are flung open and a cowboy walks in. He coolly walks up to the bar, takes a head out of the sack he is carrying and places it on the counter. The barman puts the head under the counter, opens the register, takes some money from it, grabs a bottle from the shelf and hands it all to the cowboy.\nPaddy and Maddy see this and curiosity gets the better of them. So Paddy asks the barman, \"What the fook was that all about?\"\n\"My parents were killed by a bunch of indians. So anytime someone brings me an indian's head I give them a hundred bucks and a bottle of Jack's finest.\"\nWith this seeming like the end to their troubles, they storm out and jump on some horses. They travel over hills and through valleys untill they find themselves on a ridge. Down in the valley, they spot a lone shaman by a river. Before Maddy could say anything Paddy is chasing the man down, knife in hand, tackles him from his horse and starts hacking at the poor soul's neck.\nAs all this is happening Maddy spots movement on the ridge, where thousands and thousands of indians come over the ridge, bows and arrows in hand, looking down at the spectacle below.\nMaddy shouts: \"Paddy, are ya seein' this?!\"\nAnd Paddy shouts back, \"Not now Maddy, can't ya see I'm busy?!\"\n\"Paddy, ya gotta look up and see this!\"\n\"Fook off Maddy, I'm busy!\"\n\"For fook sake! Look up man!\"\nPaddy finally looks up, sees the horde and still cutting, shouts to Maddy, \"Ya know what this means?!\"\nTo which Maddy replies, \"Aye... We're gonna be fookin' millionaires!!!\"\n\n\nFirst time I ever wrote this down. Can't remember we're I came apon it. I always tell it after a whole lot of beers. Works best if you tell the whole thing in an Irish accent and mimic some of the actions. Might be a bit long but always gets a good laugh.\n",

Even Ferdinand Feghoot could be outpunned on occasion \u2013 but he always rose to the challenge.\n\nHe conducted a crew of new S.A.R.H. (Society for the Aesthetic Rearrangement of History) recruits \u2013 all from late twentieth-century Terra \u2013 on a training study of Carter\u2019s World, a newly established agricultural colony attempting to support itself by the export of edible nuts. Barely into their second generation, and having yet to show a profit, the colonists were technologically backward. Nevertheless, they showed a surprising ingenuity in the use of their few advantages. It was this resourcefulness that Feghoot was demonstrating to his rookies.\n\n\u201cLook at the perfection with which these streets are graded\u201d, exclaimed one student. \u201cEarth-moving machinery on this scale is strictly high technology stuff. How can they do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cA new alleyway is being constructed, nearby\u201d, said Feghoot. \u201cLet us walk that way while I explain.\u201d As they strolled, he told his students that countless centuries before, the Carter\u2019s World system had been inhabited by a now-vanished race of giants. This very planet had served them for a nursery, and among the many artifacts they had left were thousands of childrens blocks, immense and precision-cut. You simply jack one up onto logs, bring it where you want it, put collapsible jacks underneath, snake out the logs, spread soil more or less evenly beneath, and collapse the jacks.\n\n\u201cI see\u201d, said the student. \u201cIt\u2019s not graded road at all; its a simple hammered-earth base.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Feghoot went on smoothly. \u201cYou just hit the road jack and don\u2019t come back no mo.\u201d\n\nHis students registered dismay and anguish.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that right, old-timer?,\u201d Feghoot demanded of an ancient Carterian standing by the mouth of the newly completed alley they had just reached.\n\n\u201cAhm afraid not, suh\u201d, said the senior citizen, and the students giggled at Feghoots discomfiture. \u201cOh, we used to do it that way, but it was far too much trouble. It\u2019s the soil heah. You see, the very same soil which produced our famous cashews is so high in clay content that a child could roll out a road of it. Then, we simply use a system of lenses to bake it into hardness. Ahve just completed this alley mahself, and ahm just a retired professor of Sports History, much too old and feeble to handle hydraulic jacks.\n\n\u201cSo you see,\u201d he finished, eyes twinkling, \u201cMah hammered alley is really cashews clay.\u201d\n\nHowls of agony rose from the students, but Feghoot never hesitated. \u201cAnd he\u201d, he said, turning to his students, \u201cis clearly the gradist.\u201d",

Walking around the store, he saw all sorts of toys and  gadgets of pleasure. Dildos and vibrators of all shapes and sizes filled the aisles,  almost overwhelming him. \n\nThe store's clerk spotted him and asked if he was looking for anything in particular. \n\n\"Uh, I'm looking for something that can keep my wife happy for two weeks.  You know,  something special\" replied the man. \n\n\"Ah,  I have just the thing. The new Bolto should do just fine.  10 inches of pure power,  it's sure to satisfy any lady\",  said the clerk. \n\n\"Nah,  that's not impressive enough. I need something really unusual to pleasure her.\"\n\n\"How about the Rumble Rod?  My customers tell me stories of them orgasming within seconds of using this product?\"\n\n\"Look, my wife and I have the best sex in the world,  and I need a product that can match that.  Surely you have something?\" said the man. \n\nAfter deliberating for a minute,  the clerk goes into the store room and comes out with an ornate ebony box.  \n\n\"This my friend,  is the Voodoo Dick.\" said the clerk. \n\n\"Okay,  what's so special about it?\" said the man. \n\n\"Allow me to demonstrate. 'Voodoo Dick!  The door!!!'\"\n\nSuddenly,  a massive black wooden phallus shoots out of the box and heads straight for the door,  pummelling it until it's reduced to splinters. \n\n\"And to return it to the box,  you just say 'Voodoo Dick!  The box!!! \"\n\nImmediately,  the Voodoo Dick returns to the box. \n\n\"Wow!\" says the man. \"I gotta get this\". \n\n\"I'm sorry,  but it's not for sale\", replies the clerk. \n\n\"Come on,  I need to have it.  Tell you what,  I'll pay you $50,000 for that.\" \n\n\"Well, I guess I can do that.  It's a deal.\" says the clerk. \n\nThe man,  satisfied with his purchase,  returns home to his wife.  He presents the box to her and tells her how to use it.  \n\n\"You see, all you have to do to use it is to say 'Voodoo Dick', then say the location of where you want it to go. Understand?\"\n\n\"Oh wow\", says the wife.  \"I can't wait to try it.\"\n\nThe next day,  the man leaves for his business trip.  After a hew hours,  the wife starts feeling horny. She decides that it's time to take out the Voodoo Dick. \n\nAfter taking off her underwear,  she says \"Voodoo Dick!  My pussy!!\" \n\nImmediately,  the Voodoo Dick shoots out and starts hammering her pussy.  The lady is in awe,  it's the best sensation she's ever had,  even better than sex with her husband.  She orgasms several times and decides that she's had enough. She tries to pull the Voodoo Dick out but it won't budge. \n\nIn panic,  she takes a pair of pliers and tries grabbing on to it,  but it keeps on hammering her. \n\nApparently,  in his excitement,  her husband had forgotten to tell her how to stop the Voodoo Dick. \n\nBarely able to stand up,  she gets to her car and starts rushing to the hospital.  She blazes down the highway going 50 over the speed limit.  Within minutes, she spots a police car behind her and pulls over. \n\nA policeman steps out and walks to her window. \"Ma'am,  do you know how fast you were going?\" he asks. \n\nThe woman,  barely able to keep her composure struggles to speak \"Y-y-y-yes off-f-fficer.

She would regularly bend down when she was near me, and I always got more than a nice view. It had to be deliberate. Because she never did it when she was near anyone else.\n\nOne day her \u201clittle\u201d sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived, and she whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn\u2019t overcome. She told me that she wanted me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. Well, I was in total shock, and couldn\u2019t say a word.\n\nShe said, \u201cI\u2019m going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me.\u201d\n\nI was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. I stood there for a moment, then turned and made a beeline straight to the front door.\n\nI opened the door, and headed straight towards my car. Lo and behold, my entire future family was standing outside, all clapping!\n\nWith tears in his eyes, my father-in-law hugged me and said, \u201cWe are very happy that you have passed our little test.

Herman and Berman were colts of average work horses and were to work the fields everyday. One day Herman and Berman decide to have a race. Everyday at noon, the lunch bell goes off, so Herman and Berman agree that the bell will signal go. The first horse to circle the farm wins. So, the next day, right before noon, Herman and Berman line up and wait for the lunch bell. Once it goes off, the two young colts dash around the farm as quickly as possible. First Herman has the lead, then it's Berman, then Herman, then Berman and Herman finally wins. \"Darn, I want a rematch tomorrow\" says Berman, to which Herman agrees.\n\nIt is the next day and the horses line up, ready to go. The lunch bell goes off and so do the horses. First Herman has the lead, then it's Berman, then Herman, then Berman and Herman finally wins by a smidgen. This continues to happen every single day. It's always a close race with Herman and Berman boxing it out for first and Herman winning by a smidgen. This becomes a lunch time tradition. It is the highlight of the day to all of the farm animals. The dog, the pigs, the cows, chickens, etc. all love the race, despite the incredibly consistent outcome. \n\nThe farmer soon realizes how incredibly talented the two horses are. He enters them in an actual race and hires rookie jockys. Berman is stokked. \"Today is the day you go down. My jocky is lighter than yours\" says Berman to Herman. \"We'll see about that\" replies Herman. The gun sets the race off. Immediately Herman and Berman smoke the field. The race will clearly be won by either Herman or Berman. They horses get 100m away from the finish in a dead tie. Herman inches ahead. Then comes Berman. Then Herman. Then Berman. Aaand Herman wins.\n\nThis continues for every race of the two horse's careers. The two become famous as an unstoppable duo and never place anything but first or second. \n\nFinally, the two horses retire. They are just too old to race competitively anymore. But they still race around the farm every lunch break to the same result. \n\nHerman and Berman finally have one last race. All the animals gather to watch. The two horses are way too old to race, but they try their hardest. The bell goes off and the two run off. They are significantly slower than their youth days, but they have some zest to them yet. Herman takes a quick lead over Berman, but Berman catches up as the round the barn. Berman takes a slight lead at the halfway point and the Herman nudges ahead soon thereafter. Then it's Berman. Then Herman. And Berman. And Herman. And Berman and Heman and Berman. AAand BERMIN WINS.\n\n\"Ha take that!\" shouts Berman to Herman. \"I won!\". \"No you didn't, I won\" replies Herman. They argue for a little while and then the dog says \"No, Berman definitely won, but only by a little\". At that point, both horses say in unison \"Oh my gosh! A talking dog!\"",

The evening rush hour is from noon to 7:00 pm. Friday's rush hour starts on Thursday morning.\n3. The minimum acceptable speed on I-285 is 80 mph. On I-75 and I-85, your speed is expected to at least match the highway number. Anything less is considered 'Wussy'.\n4. Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere. Atlanta has its own version of traffic rules. For example, Ferraris and Lamborghinis owned by sports stars go first at a four-way stop. Cars/trucks with the loudest muffler go second. The trucks with the biggest tires go third. The HOV lanes are really designed just for the slow Floridians passing through who are used to hogging the left lane everywhere.\n5. If you actually stop at a yellow light or stop sign, you will be rear ended, cussed out, and possibly shot. Unless there is a police car nearby.\n6. Never honk at anyone. Ever. Seriously. It's another offense that can get you shot.\n7. Road construction is permanent and continuous. Detour barrels are moved around for your entertainment pleasure during the middle of the night to make the next day's driving a bit more exciting. Generally, city roads other than the main streets have more potholes and bumps (usually speed bumps) than most dirt roads in the countryside.\n8. Watch carefully for road hazards such as drunks, possums, skunks, dogs, barrels, cones, furniture, cats, mattresses, shredded tires, squirrels, rabbits, and crows.\n9. Be aware that spelling of street names may change from block to block, e.g., Clairmont, Claremont, Clairmonte.\n10. If someone actually has their turn signal on, wave them to the shoulder immediately to let them know it has been \u201caccidentally activated\u201d.\n11. If you are in the left lane and only driving 75 in a 55-65 mph zone, k, e.g., you are considered a road hazard and will be \u201cflipped off\u201d accordingly. If you return the flip, you'll be shot.\n12. For summer driving, it is advisable to wear potholders on your hands.",

It was just a heap of flesh and lard that looked like it had never been washed in the hundred and fifty or so years that it looked like she'd been alive.\n\nShe walked to the bed, grunting something that I took to mean that it was time to get started.\n\nMy penis had shot back into my body like a turtle head, but I knew that my only chance of escaping an eternity of torment was to finish this deed.\n\nSo, I closed my eyes, held my breath, and with intense concentration, I was able to get half an erection, and the she-beast climbed on top.\n\nLet me tell you, even with my eyes closed and breath held, there was no escaping the texture. The thick, pungent, sticky... stuff down there made it difficult to keep from vomiting. But I just went into a zen state, imagined it was just a congealed and rotting cheese sandwich, and after a while, I had the most unwilling orgasm of my life (or afterlife).\n\nThe thing left the room, and the devil walked in, amazed that I was able to complete the task, as many had tried, but none had yet succeeded. But he agreed to keep his end of the bargain, and led me out the door.\n\nAs we were walking toward the exit, we passed another bedroom door, and through it I saw Jim, having sex with Jennifer Lawrence.\n\n\"Whoah, Satan,\" I said, \"What the heck? I had to have sex with that creature, but Jim gets to have sex with Jennifer Lawrence?\"\n\n\"Well, sure,\" said Satan, \"Jennifer Lawrence wants to get out of here, too.\"",

We will grant you three wishes!\" the first genie proclaims.\n\nThe man thinks. \"OK, first I want ten million dollars in my bank account, and I want it legal! No crimes or anything.\"\n\nThe second genie claps his hands. \"IT IS DONE!\" He looks at the man. \"Your second wish?\"\n\n\"I want my garage and driveway to be full of expensive cars. Nothing worth less than $500,000!\" the man says.\n\n\"Done!\" says the first genie, clapping his hands together. \"And for your final wish?\"\n\nThe man turns red. \"Listen, uh...this is going to be a bit embarrassing so can I just whisper it to you?\" he asks the second genie.\n\n\"Of course,\" the second genie replies.\n\nThe man leans over and whispers his final wish to the second genie. The second genie motions for the other genie to follow him and they both walk out of the basement.\n\nA minute later, a group of men in white robes bursts into the basement and grabs the man who had made the wishes. The man struggled against them, but the men tied him up, tied a rope around his neck, and pulled him up by the rafters until he was dead.\n\nAfter a few minutes, two of the robed men remove their hoods and look at each other. It's the two genies. \"I can understand the wish for the money and the wish for luxury cars,\" the second genie said, \"but why the fuck did he want to be hung like a black man?\"",

I was having suspicions that my wife was cheating on me and I decided today would be the day I would catch her. So, I left work a few hours early, took the elevator up to my 5th story apartment and surprised my wife. She was acting really shady but after looking all over my apartment I found no one else there. My nerves were getting to me, so I went out on the balcony for a smoke, and sure as shit, there is this guy hanging from the balcony by his finger tips! Well, I start pounding away at his hands until all his fingers broke and he let go. I thought that was going to be it, but the son of a bitch landed in a bush and lived! So in a fit of rage, I grabbed my refrigerator, and threw it over the edge on top of the guy. Unfortunately, my jacket got snagged on the handle of the fridge and I went over with it. And, well, here I am.\"\n\nThe angel thinks for a second and replies, \"well, we normally frown upon things like murder, but you did find out your wife was unfaithful and that really sucks. You can come on in.\"\n\nThe second man walks up to the angel and says, \"well it all started when I was having a really bad day at work today. When I'm stressed, I like to blow off steam by working out. So I left work early and went home. I took the elevator up to my 6th floor apartment and went out to my balcony where I keep my weights. After lifting for about an hour, I tripped and fell over my railing. I thought I was doomed but I managed to grab onto the balcony below me. I was hanging there for a second, but I couldn't pull myself up because my arms were so smoked from working out. I thought I was saved when this guy came out, but instead of helping me up, he broke all my fingers and I fell! Luckily, I landed in a bush and survived the fall. I thought I was okay, but then out of no where, a fridge comes falling down and lands right on my face! I guess that did me in, 'cause now I'm here.\"\n\nThe angel thinks for a moment and says, \"wow, I can't believe how bad your luck is.

He decided to build his house out of steel beams.\n One day, a big bad wolf came around to the first little pig's house. He was very hungry, so he took a big bite out of the straw house and tore it down with his teeth. The little piggy was forced to flee  to his second brother's house.\n When the wolf arrived at the second little pig's house, he brought a bulldozer with him and started ripping through the house. The pigs were absolutely terrified, and they ran all the way to their big brother's house.\n Before going to the third pig's house, the wolf knew that he needed something big. \n The wolf went to the house of the third pig, and crashed two jets into the house. The third little pig laughed at the wolf, and calmly said to him, \"Silly wolf, jet fuel can't melt steel beams!\"\n",

The once-colorful sign reads \"Psychic readings performed; $20.00 per palm reading, first question answered FREE.\" The man, intrigued, decides that he could skip his usual Starbucks stop in exchange for a new experience, and pulls off to the side of the road.\n\nAs he gets out of his car, he notices a strange look about the house. First off, the house is covered in a bright purple paint which has been badly chipped from many years baking in the sun. Secondly, none of the house's openings are level: windows are cracked and crooked, and the front door is slanted to the left. And, strangely enough, there is no paved pathway to the front door; simply worn grass, then patio, then door.\n\nDespite all of these oddities, the man proceeds to walk from his car, up the oil-stained driveway, across the path of matted-down brown grass, onto the crumbling concrete patio, and knocks on the old oak door with a resounding *thunk* *thunk*\n\nBut before the man could knock a third time, the door swung open, revealing a plump elderly lady dressed in a thick red cloak decorated many translucent pink scarves. The man is taken aback by how quickly she answered the door, especially because of how old and out of shape she apparently was.\n\nThe lady in red introduces herself as the psychic in a flamboyant, yet obviously rehearsed way:\n\n\"I am the psychic of Piccadilly Lane!\"\n\nShe continues, pointing at the man \"You have come to have your future seen, your misfortunes foretold, and your successes predicted!\"\n\nThe man, still a little confused by the woman's quickness at answering the door, is actually impressed by the psychic's act, assuring himself that this was going to be far more entertaining than his planned trip to Starbucks.\n\nThe psychic then proceeds to calmly invite the man into her home, and he follows. Decidedly, the inside of the psychic's home is far stranger than the outside. Bookcases line the walls with literature written in many different languages: Latin, English, Greek, French, and even a few the man was unable to identify. Sitting atop the bookcases are dusty knick-knacks ranging from snow globes and creepy red-fabric dolls to broken crystal balls and a cuckoo clock the man swears is running backwards.\n\nHe follows the lady into a warm and poorly-lit room draped in cotton and lace curtains. In the center is a card table covered with an elaborately-weaved purple and gold tablecloth. On the table is a glowing crystal ball sitting atop a beautifully engraved wooden bowl. The engravings show scenes of both erotic pleasure and horrible torture that the man hopes are symbolic for life rather than his own personal future. He is then directed to one of two deeply tan leather chairs parked on either side of the table. After both the Psychic and the man sat down, she addresses the man:\n\n\"Sir, as you may have read up front, I can see the answer to any question you pose me, and I answer the first question free of charge. So, think deeply about what you wish to ask.\"\n\nThe man, after a few seconds, speaks to the psychic: \"So I can ask you any question and you will answer it?\"\n\n\"Yes, to the best of my ability\"\n\nThe man nods, satisfied, and leaves.",

The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.\n\n\nThe elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.\n\n\nTwenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.\n\n\nRemembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.\n\nProbably wasn't the same fucking elephant.\n",

He bought a farm, and buys a heard of sheep.  Everything is going well, the sheep are properly housed and fed.  The sheep are all grazing and seem fit all season.  But when it came to sheering the sheep something went horribly wrong, the sheep's wool was coming out all tough and stringy.  When the young man tried to sell the wool he was told it was worthless.  A buyer examined the wool and asked;\n\n\"Did you chum the sheep?\"\n\nThe young man had no idea what the buyer meant.  He figured it was just some slang he never heard before for feeding and grazing the sheep.  The buyer said the wool was worthless and he had to throw it away.  To recover some of his loss the young farmer decided to slaughter some of the sheep.  So he took a few sheep to the butcher who said;\n\n\"The meat on these sheep is tough to the bone.  It's worthless.  Did you chum the sheep?\"  \n\nAnd young man had no idea what the butcher meant so he asked what chumming the sheep meant.  \n\n\"To fuck it, of course,\" said the butcher.  \n\nThe young man was shocked and said the butcher was kidding.  The butcher didn't smile at all and was dead serious.  \n\n\"You gotta chum the sheep lad,\" said the butcher, \"If you don't chum the sheep, the sheep get upset and the wool comes out all stringy.  The meat gets too tough to eat.\"\n\nThe young man said even if he could fuck the sheep he couldn't possibly fuck the whole heard.  The butcher said relax, he could hire a professional sheep chummer.  Everyone in the county hired sheep chummers.  So the young farmer asked how much it cost to hire professional sheep chummer.  $20/hour.  That seemed steep to the young farmer, but the butcher said.\n\n\"They're from Wales, lad, that's the most they can afford to pay ye,\" said the butcher.\n\nSo the young farmer calls a sheep chummer who shows up the next day, an old man from Wales.  \n\n\"Aye, I'm here to chum the sheep,\" he said.  \n\nSo the young farmer points out the heard and the old man has at it.  He chummed the whole heard in just over two hours.  All of a sudden the sheep's wool was vastly improved, the butcher said the meat was as tender as he ever saw.  The young farmer as astonished how effective it was and he asked the butcher when did people discover sheep chumming was so effective?  The butcher said it was shortly after people from Wales discovered two brand new uses for sheep.  \n\n\"What was that?\" asked the young farmer.  \n\n\"Wool and meat,\" said the butcher.  \n",

It was a regular party bus, and they were cruising along at a pretty good clip, partying and whooping it up.\n\nUnbeknownst to the driver, another bus was headed towards them at a high rate of speed.  This was a prison bus, full of criminals of the worst sort, who had just overpowered their driver and were headed at top speed away from the Vegas area into the desert.  As you can imagine they weren't driving too carefully, on account of being a bunch of wanted escapees, and as fate would have it they lost control of the bus and jumped the median just as they were passing the sports bus.\n\nIt was a horrible accident.  Both buses exploded, body parts went everywhere.  When the local rural sheriff arrived, he was just overwhelmed at the amount of carnage.  They were still a good hour outside of Vegas, and there was hardly any medical examiner or funeral home around that could possible take care of this giant mess of humanity. \n\nHowever, the sheriff did recall that the nearby town had a semi private medical examiner / funeral director who also ran a junk removal business on the side.  Desperate for a solution, the sheriff gave him a ring.  \n\n\"Hmmm,\" the man said after hearing a description of the scene. \"Well I can possibly bring the junk truck, but here's the deal - when I'm acting a a funeral director, I get paid by the body.  And when I'm doing junk removal, I get paid by the pound.  So it sound like you've just got a mess of body parts out there that will be hard to sort through.  I dunno, I may lose money taking this job.  Let me talk it over with my wife.\"\n\nSo the man turns to his wife, who ran the business, and asked her what she thought - was it worth it to take this job by the pound instead of by the body?\n\n\"Well, honey,\" the wife says, \"we'll figure it out.  By the pound will probably work out fine.  We just have to carefully weigh the pros and cons....\"",

I can't say i was expecting you, so i guess St. Peter made a mistake when he put you on the Hell list. I'll have one of my demons phone him right away. In the mean time, well, there isn't much, but if you want to amuse yourself, i can help you with that.\"\n\nThe engineer thinks for a moment, and then says, \"You know, it is extremely hot down here. I'd love to build a large AC unit. Do you have the materials?\"\n\nSatan says, \"Well, yes, we have all manners of metals due to our location under the Earth's crust. Have at it.\"\n\nThe engineer, after 3 days of heavy work, finishes his Hell-wide AC and turns it on. After 3 hours, the temperature has finally reached a more desirable 78 degrees, and Hell is much less hellish. Satan is highly impressed. \"Nice work, i didn't think this was even possible! Sorry to say, though, St. Peter refuses to admit he messed up. Since you made this AC happen, I'll let you do whatever you want.\"\n\nThe engineer thinks, and says, \"You now it's also really dark and dim with just the lava flows. Have the materials for a lighting system?\" Satan says, \"Of course! God sent some heavenly light once but i never could figure out how it worked. Here's the instructions.\"\n\n2 days later, the heavenly light had been configured to brightly light Hell. Productivity was way up and now Hell was not so bad anymore. Satan tells the engineer, \"I like you, bud! Tell you what, you can live like a king. Got a room in my castle for you. Everything you could ever want is there.\"\n\nAt this point, several angels had reviewed the engineer's life and informed God of St. Peter's mistake. God hastily adds the engineer to the Heaven list. He calls Satan and asks for the engineer.\n\nSatan says, \"No way, man! Hell has never been so nice before him. We have lighting, cooling, and now he's tinkering with machines that haven't worked since your son went to Earth! I'm keeping him.\"\n\nGod immediately responds, \"He is a good man, though! He belongs in Heaven. It is only right! If you will not return him, I'll have to take you to court.\"\n\nSatan laughs, and says, \"Oh, and just where will you find a lawyer?\"",

Obama's aide then said, \"Look, I'll write a check here and now for a donation of $10,000 to your church if you'll just tell the congregation you see Obama as a saint.\" The Cardinal thought about it and said, \"Well, the church can use the money, so I'll work your request into tomorrow's sermon.\"\n \nAs Obama's aide promised, Obama appeared for the Sunday worship and seated himself prominently at the forward left side of the center aisle. As promised, at the start of his sermon, the Cardinal pointed out that Obama was present. The Cardinal went on to explain to the congregation, \"While President Obama\u2019s presence is probably an honor to some, the man is not numbered among my personal favorite personages. Some of his views are contrary to tenets of the Church, and he tends to flip-flop on many other issues. Barack Obama is a petty, self-absorbed hypocrite, a thumb sucker and a nit-wit. Barack Obama is also a serial liar, a cheat, and a thief. I must say, Barack Obama is the worst example of a Christian I have ever personally witnessed. He is a narcissist and is using his speaking ability to lie to the American people. He also has a reputation for shirking his obligations, both In Washington and in Illinois. The man is simply not to be trusted.\"\n \nThe Cardinal concluded, \"But, when compared with Hillary Clinton, Obama is a Saint.\"",

He'd work all day, drink all night, and do it again the next day.\n\nOver time, things got worse and worse, and then one morning after an especially heavy bender, he slept through his alarm, and showed up to work late and hungover, and his boss fired him on the spot.\n\n\"Maybe this could be an opportunity,\" one of his friends said. \"You hated that job anyway - maybe this is your chance to follow your dream.\"\n\nThe poop thought about this, and decided that yes - he was going to turn his life around, leave this podunk town, and travel to Hollywood, California, and become a great actor.\n\nHe sold enough of his belongings to afford a ticket to California, and left the next day with nothing but the shirt on his back. \n\nWhen he arrived in Los Angeles, he got straight to work looking for auditions. He tried out for every part he could find, but no one cast him. He went from studio to studio looking for something - anything - but the casting directors simply weren't interested in hiring a piece of poop.\n\nAs the days went by, the rejection was beginning to wear on him, as he was only eating what scraps he could find, and was sleeping outside only long enough for the cops to tell him to move along.\n\nIt was about a week later, and the piece of poop was at the only studio he had yet to try, hoping even for just a part as a background extra. Anything to get his foot in the door.\n\nWhen the casting director saw him, she wouldn't even listen to his audition - she just said they weren't interested.\n\nThe poop had had enough. \"Not interested? Let me tell you what I'M not interested in. I'm not interested in breaking. I'm not interested in giving up on my dreams. I'm not interested in accepting that I'm not worthy because of what I look like, and I'm not interested in going back to a life I hated because you're too closed-minded to see GREATNESS when it's staring you in the face!\"\n\nThe casting director was just about to call security, when there was a knock on the door.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said the man at the door, \"I was walking by, and couldn't help overhearing. It's been a long time since I've seen anyone with this much passion. You have something special, kid - I think you have the potential to be one of the real greats in this business.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked the poop.\n\n\"I'm the President of Movies,\" said the man. \"and I'm about to make you a star.\"\n\nThe poop went along with the president down to his limo, and the two did lunch to discuss what sort of projects would be best to collaborate on. The poop had some great ideas, and the president knew just the people to bring in to make them happen.\n\nThe poop's first film was a blockbuster hit. The second was even bigger. The third became the highest grossing movie in history. Everyone in America fell in love with Hollywood's newest A-lister.\n\nBut so much fame so fast went to the poop's head. He started getting in to the celebrity part lifestyle, drinking, doing coke... The paparazzi began following him around to see if he'd do something crazy.\n\nThen one night a young man approached the poop while he was out partying at the club.\n\n\"Yo, I'm a huge fan. Can you sign my DVD?\" the young man asked.\n\n\"Beat it, kid, can't you see I'm trying to snort coke off this stripper's ass?\" said the poop.\n\n\"What the hell? It'll only take a second. Come on, sign it!\"\n\n\"I said GET OUT OF MY FACE!\" yelled the poop. A crowd began to gather around as the paparazzi snapped photos left and right.\n\n\"You know what, poop? Get flushed!\" the young man said as he picked up a glass of water and threw it at the poop.\n\nAnd that's when the shit hit the fan.",

To at least have something, Jake decides to take it with him.\n\nAnd then the journey begins.\n\nSo he walks...\n\nAnd walks...\n\nAnd walks...\n\nEventually, he gets too exhausted to walk, so he crawls...\n\nAnd crawls...\n\nAnd crawls...\n\nAnd crawls...\n\nDehydrated from the blazing desert heat, he gives in to his reflexes and drinks the windshield wiper fluid.\n\nIt didn't help.\n\nSo he continued to crawl...\n\nAnd crawl...\n\nAnd crawl...\n\nBut then, as he thought he couldn't crawl anymore, he sees the strangest thing in his entire life: a snake wrapped around a large upright stick.\n\nBewildered, he approached the reptile.\n\nThen, the snake speaks to Jake:\n\n\"Hello, I am Nate, Guardian of the Lever. If the lever is pulled, the entire universe, everything in it, and all life will come to an end. I was told that the next person who approaches would be the new Guardian of the Lever, and I was to grant him three wishes to reward him for accepting this noble task.\"\n\nJake processes the extreme responsibility bestowed upon him, and gladly accepts his new role. He begins with his first wish:\n\n\"First, make me healthy. I am simultaneously dying of windshield wiper poisoning and dehydration.\"\n\nAnd Nate obeyed; with a swish of his tail, Jake was cured.\n\n\"Second, get me out of this desert. While the Lever is great, I want to go home.\"\n\nNate replies, \"Before I grant your second wish, what is your third wish?\"\n\nJake ponders this, and finally decides, \"I want all of the wisdom in the entire universe. I want to understand how to be successful and live life to the fullest.\"\n\nAnd then Nate granted both of Jake's wishes, bringing him back home with new knowledge.\n\nWith this knowledge, Jake became very wealthy. He bought a beautiful house with an amazing view, started a family, and sold an extremely successful start-up.\n\nHowever, Jake knew of his responsibility, and would often go to see his good friend Nate, who still lived by the Lever because he had been there for so long.\n\nOn one of his trips to visit Nate, Jake takes a new car through the desert. After a distance, Jake sees the Lever, a cliff, and Nate. Jake decides to stop the car and reaches to brake, but he unfortunately bought his car from the wrong person, for the brakes weren't working. Jake analyzes the situation. If he keeps going straight, he'll plummet off of a cliff. If he turns left, he'll hit the Lever which will end the entire universe, everything in it, and all life. If he turns right, he'll crush his good friend Nate.\n\nJake knows the correct decision.\n\nHe turns right and kills his good friend Nate.\n\nJake then exclaims, \"Better Nate than Lever!\"",

The baby buffalo attended the local elementary school and the parents were respected members of the neighborhood and both had pretty decent jobs, but life was still rough and at times the family found themselves barely scraping by, sometimes not even. Now, as the buffalo family lived in a rough neighborhood, drugs were very common and the parents, during a period of mental distress, were introduced to heroin by one of their friends. At first it was a casual thing, they'd shoot maybe once a week or so to take the edge off, but over time what was once a weekend vice spiraled into crippling addiction, and it got to the point where they both lost their jobs, and would do anything they could to support their fix, and this meant sometimes selling their son for sex. When the son protested, the parents would beat him, but in places where people couldn't see, such as the back, stomach and legs. The parents would often resort to beating the baby buffalo whenever anything happened that upset them, regardless of how irrational or little the present issue had to do with their son. After about 4 months of this behavior, one of the baby buffalo's teachers noticed him limping and wincing in pain every time he moved, so she inquired and upon finding out about the situation, called Child Protective Services. CPS launches an investigation and (miraculously..) are able to jail the parents and they tell the child that he will be placed in foster care. In the last fleeting moments that all three are under the same roof, as the parents are being dragged past their child and out of the house, they find themselves confused, realizing all they have done. Finding themselves near speechless, they struggle to mutter their last words to their child:\n\"Bison\"",

Apparently it had been a pretty busy day, though, so Peter had to tell the first one, \"Heaven's getting pretty close to full today, and I've been asked to admit only people who have had particularly horrible deaths. So what's your story?\" \n\nSo the first man replies: \"Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell -- but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony.\" \n\n\"That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,\" said Peter, and let the man in. \n\nThe second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. \n\n\"It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I'm here.\" \n\nOnce again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death. \n\nThe third man came to the front of the line, and again Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story. \n\n\"Picture this,\" says the third man, \"I'm hiding inside a refrigerator...\" \n",

They are both about the same size, with similar features. How could Donnie be so much more attractive. They could barely walk anywhere without some hot blonde in a bikini biting her lip and smiling at Donnie while she looked him up and down. By the end of the day Donnie had five of their numbers.\n\nThat night, after a few drinks, Jimmy finally has enough and asks Donnie \"what's the deal, man? I'm as good looking as you, but for some reason all of the girls all day were throwing themselves at you all day and completely ignoring me. Am I really that ugly?\"\n\n\"No, man,\" Donnie replied. \"This is a little embarrassing, but I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. When I go to the beach, what I do is I put a banana in my swimsuit. Girls can't keep their eyes off of me. That's it.\"\n\n\"That's it?\" Jimmy says, aghast. \"It's so simple!\"\n\n\"Try it tomorrow.\" Donnie suggests, \"and let's see who can get the most numbers. I bet you'll win.\"\n\nSo the next day, they split up and go back to the beach. Jimmy slips the banana in his swimsuit and starts to stroll down the beach, smiling at all of the ladies along the way. To his surprise, the chicks all seem more repulsed with him than they did before. He gets looks of disgust, or gets laughed at by just about every girl he sees. A few girls even scream and run away from him as he tries to ask them for his number. \n\nCompletely crestfallen, Jimmy meets up with Donnie later and explains to him what happened. \n\n\"So what do you think happened?\" Jimmy asks.\n\nDonnie looks Jimmy up and down. \"Oh...\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I forgot to tell you, dude.\" Donnie says. \"You got to put the banana in the front of the swimsuit.\"",

I owe my life to him, because he took out so many of them. I remember, one of them was charging my Humvee and was a few feet away when the good private gunned him down. They caught on though, and sent an RPG at his car. He was the only survivor from his Jeep, but his legs never left. We soon got the damn Afghans on the retreat, and hauled ass to the nearest base to get Danny and many others fixed up. He survived with his arms, and was awarded many medals. When given the option to either be honorably discharged, or to serve as an officer. He chose the latter, and was given the rank of Lieutenant. He went on to do many great things as a Lieutenant, but was cut short when his camp came under ambush and he was caught in the neck by a stray round.

So the monkey proceeds to tell the lion what really happened and the lion says angrily \"get on my back, we'll get him together\". So they start rushing back to the dog. The dog sees them and realized what happened and starts to panic even more. He then gets another idea and shouts \"where the hell is that monkey! I told him to bring me another lion an hour ago...\"",

She and her husband became very concerned, so they took her to the doctor. They discovered that she had lung cancer, and that she only had one week left to live. One night, while she was very deep asleep, her husband tried to wake her up. Now over the past few days she had been drinking a lot, so she was out cold. But, her husband thought that she had died. He took her to the funeral parlor, and they laid her to rest. However, she woke up. She began to pound on the sides of the sarcophagus, but she was already inside the ground. Her ex-husband could hear her cries, but since they ended on not-so-good terms, he chuckled and said: \"I guess Ms. Coughlin will be coughin' inside her coffin\"",

A mistake of this magnitude only warranted death by means of the Supreme Dictator's favorite mode of execution: the electric chair.\n\nNow despite being a dystopian society, the world still has it's share of principles. An example of this would be the practice of the last meal. On the day of Saba Saging's execution, the Supreme Dictator asks him what he would want for his last meal.\n\n\"It is my wish to consume a single ripe plantain.\" answers Saging.\n\nThe Supreme Dictator grants him his request and as Saging is eating his plantain, he is seated in the electric chair and the lever is pulled. A burst of electricity surges into the chair but for some unknown reason... Saging is unharmed.\n\nEver the fatalistic person, the Supreme Dictator sees this as a sign that maybe the music director should be given another chance. And so, Saba Saging is a free man once again.\n\nThe next year comes and Saging is once again instructed to perform as music director for the Grand Orchestra's concert on the Supreme Dictator's birthday.\n\nEverything is going well until Saging made the mistake of prompting the violinists too early on the third section of the fourth piece. A mistake of this magnitude only warranted death by means of the Supreme Dictator's favorite mode of execution: the electric chair.\n\nOn the day of Saba Saging's execution, the Supreme Dictator asks him again what he would like for his last meal.\n\n\"If the Supreme Dictator could grant me this final request, that is, I would like to eat a plantain, I know that once my time comes I shall be able to rest in peace.\"\n\nAnd so, just like the year before, the Supreme Dictator grants Saging his request. As the young music director was eating his plantain, he is seated in the electric chair and the lever is pulled. A burst of electricity surges into the chair but for some unknown reason... Saging remains unharmed.\n\nConfounded and frustrated, the Supreme Dictator curses fate and lets Saging go once again.\n\nSix months pass and the Supreme Dictator becomes mortally ill. On his deathbed he commands the Grand Orchestra to perform for one last time. Saba Saging, still the one leading the ensemble, proceeds to guide the band into its final and most spectacular performance.\n\nEnraptured by the exquisite music, the Supreme Dictator is about to peacefully pass away when a jarring note comes from the misguided instruments of the trombone's group. Fury engulfs the Supreme Dictator and he orders that the whole orchestra be executed. However, Saba Saging screams with remorse and implores the Supreme Dictator to spare his band mates and only punish him.\n\nRevitalized by a profound sense of purpose fueled by anger, the Supreme Dictator personally drags Saging into the electric chair and shoves him a whole bushel of plantains.\n\n\"EAT IT! EAT ALL OF IT!\" screams the Supreme Dictator.\n\nAnd as Saging reluctantly accepts his fate he eats each plantain slowly one by one.\n\nWhen Saging finally finishes the last piece of fruit, the Supreme Dictator, with a manic glint in his eyes, pulls the lever of the electric chair and lets out an exultant roar. He lets the electricity surge forth, never letting up until several hours pass.\n\nExhausted and feeling the creeping call of death, the Supreme Dictator crouches over Saging and checks to see if the music director was still. His eyes go wide with incredulity and shock.\n\n\"What sorcery is this?!\" the Supreme Dictator shouts. \"Does the plantain somehow provide you with invulnerability or immortality? Tell me! For my soul cannot rest with the fact that I have had the knowledge of how to defy death under my nose after all these years!\"\n\nSaba Saging, tired but unscathed, sits upright on the metal chair and sighs.\n\n\"Plantains have nothing to do with it.\" he says, while looking sadly at the dying ruler.\n\n\"Then how?\" asks the Supreme Dictator, ever so closely treading the edge of death's threshold.\n\n\"I guess...\" Saba Saging sighs, \"After all these years, I'm still a bad conductor.\"",

They had a code of conduct which was being passed from one generation to the next verbally. \nAll went well until they got into a war with a Samoan tribe (islanders who are 1000s of kms away) who were assisted by European missionaries. \nThe Mao tribals defeated their enemies but most of the elders died. With them, most of the codes of  conduct were also lost. This lead to a  period of great strife and lawlessness in the Mao tribe that made the remaining elders sad. During this time, they also faced a lot of trouble from Christian missionaries trying to convert their people. \nThese elders decided to form a new code of conduct and realised that it had to be permanently recorded to prevent any such mishaps in the future. \nFor this purpose, they sent a bright youngster to the missionaries so that he can understand how they recorded law. This youngster learnt about scripts,  language, linguistics, paper, pen etc for a period of 5 years. He also learnt about weapons, the teachings of Christ, law etc.. He went back to his tribe armed with this knowledge and educated his fellows about what he learnt, especially the concept of book.\nThe Mao elders were overjoyed and felt that they can now develop a standardized code of conduct, that will maintain the equality and also prevent exploitation by the missionaries. They were also intrigued by the concept of a book. They asked the youngster to teach them and the rest of the villagers how to use one.\nThe youngster decided he would demonstrate to the villagers the concept and purpose of a script for a language. In this endeavour he chose a flat piece of wall that can act as his paper and moved forward with his pen, a piece of twig dipped in goat blood, to be used as ink.\n\n\nHe was promptly killed by some of the villager elders who happened to be left handed. \n\nApparently the lefties couldn't digest the youngster leaning to write.",

        "body": "An oldie, but a goodie:\n\nI never dreamed slowly cruising through a residential neighborhood could be so incredibly dangerous!\n\nStudies have shown that motorcycling requires more decisions per second, and more sheer data processing than nearly any other common activity or sport. The reactions and accurate decision making abilities needed have been likened to the reactions of fighter pilots! The consequences of bad decisions or poor situational awareness are pretty much the same for both groups too.\n\nOccasionally, as a rider I have caught myself starting to make bad or late decisions while riding. In flight training, my instructors called this being \u201cbehind the power curve\u201d. It is a mark of experience that when this begins to happen, the rider recognizes the situation, and more importantly, does something about it. A short break, a meal, or even a gas stop can set things right again as it gives the brain a chance to catch up.\n\nGood, accurate, and timely decisions are essential when riding a motorcycle\u2026at least if you want to remain among the living. In short, the brain needs to keep up with the machine.\n\nI had been banging around the roads of east Texas and as I headed back into Dallas, found myself in very heavy, high-speed traffic on the freeways. Normally, this is not a problem, I commute in these conditions daily, but suddenly I was nearly run down by a cage that decided it needed my lane more than I did. This is not normally a big deal either, as it happens around here often, but usually I can accurately predict which drivers are not paying attention and avoid them before we are even close. This one I missed seeing until it was nearly too late, and as I took evasive action I nearly broadsided another car that I was not even aware was there!\n\nTwo bad decisions and insufficient situational awareness\u2026all within seconds. I was behind the power curve. Time to get off the freeway.\n\nI hit the next exit, and as I was in an area I knew pretty well, headed through a few big residential neighborhoods as a new route home. As I turned onto the nearly empty streets I opened the visor on my full-face helmet to help get some air. I figured some slow riding through the quiet surface streets would give me time to relax, think, and regain that \u201cedge\u201d so frequently required when riding.\n\nLittle did I suspect\u2026\n\nAs I passed an oncoming car, a brown furry missile shot out from under it and tumbled to a stop immediately in front of me. It was a squirrel, and must have been trying to run across the road when it encountered the car. I really was not going very fast, but there was no time to brake or avoid it\u2014it was that close.\n\nI hate to run over animals\u2026and I really hate it on a motorcycle, but a squirrel should pose no danger to me. I barely had time to brace for the impact.\n\nAnimal lovers, never fear. Squirrels can take care of themselves!\n\nInches before impact, the squirrel flipped to his feet. He was standing on his hind legs and facing the oncoming Valkyrie with steadfast resolve in his little beady eyes. His mouth opened, and at the last possible second, he screamed and leapt! I am pretty sure the scream was squirrel for, \u201cBanzai!\u201d or maybe, \u201cDie you gravy-sucking, heathen scum!\u201d as the leap was spectacular and he flew over the windshield and impacted me squarely in the chest.\n\nInstantly he set upon me. If I did not know better I would have sworn he brought twenty of his little buddies along for the attack. Snarling, hissing, and tearing at my clothes, he was a frenzy of activity. As I was dressed only in a light t-shirt, summer riding gloves, and jeans this was a bit of a cause for concern. This furry little tornado was doing some damage!\n\nPicture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a t-shirt, and leather gloves puttering maybe 25mph down a quiet residential street\u2026and in the fight of his life with a squirrel. And losing.\n\nI grabbed for him with my left hand and managed to snag his tail. With all my strength I flung the evil rodent off the left of the bike, almost running into the right curb as I recoiled from the throw.\n\nThat should have done it. The matter should have ended right there. It really should have. The squirrel could have sailed into one of the pristinely kept yards and gone on about his business, and I could have headed home. No one would have been the wiser.\n\nBut this was no ordinary squirrel. This was not even an ordinary pissed-off squirrel.\n\nThis was an evil attack squirrel of death!\n\nSomehow he caught my gloved finger with one of his little hands, and with the force of the throw swung around and with a resounding thump and an amazing impact he landed square on my back and resumed his rather anti-social and extremely distracting activities. He also managed to take my left glove with him!\n\nThe situation was not improved. Not improved at all. His attacks were continuing, and now I could not reach him.\n\nI was startled to say the least. The combination of the force of the throw, only having one hand (the throttle hand) on the handlebars, and my jerking back unfortunately put a healthy twist through my right hand and into the throttle. A healthy twist on the throttle of a Valkyrie can only have one result. Torque. This is what the Valkyrie is made for, and she is very, very good at it.\n\nThe engine roared as the front wheel left the pavement. The squirrel screamed in anger. The Valkyrie screamed in ecstasy. I screamed in\u2026well\u2026I just plain screamed.\n\nNow picture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a slightly squirrel torn t-shirt, and only one leather glove roaring at maybe 70mph and rapidly accelerating down a quiet residential street\u2026on one wheel and with a demonic squirrel on his back. The man and the squirrel are both screaming bloody murder.\n\nWith the sudden acceleration I was forced to put my other hand back on the handlebars and try to get control of the bike. This was leaving the mutant squirrel to his own devices, but I really did not want to crash into somebody\u2019s tree, house, or parked car. Also, I had not yet figured out how to release the throttle\u2026my brain was just simply overloaded. I did manage to mash the back brake, but it had little affect against the massive power of the big cruiser.\n\nAbout this time the squirrel decided that I was not paying sufficient attention to this very serious battle (maybe he is a Scottish attack squirrel of death), and he came around my neck and got IN my full-face helmet with me. As the faceplate closed partway and he began hissing in my face I am quite sure my screaming changed tone and intensity. It seemed to have little affect on the squirrel however.\n\nThe rpm\u2019s on The Dragon maxed out (I was not concerned about shifting at the moment) and her front end started to drop.\n\nNow picture the large man on the huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a very ragged torn t-shirt, and wearing one leather glove, roaring at probably 80mph, still on one wheel, with a large puffy squirrel\u2019s tail sticking out his mostly closed full-face helmet. By now the screams are probably getting a little hoarse.\n\nFinally I got the upper hand\u2026I managed to grab his tail again, pulled him out of my helmet, and slung him to the left as hard as I could. This time it worked\u2026sort-of. Spectacularly sort-of, so to speak.\n\nPicture the scene. You are a cop. You and your partner have pulled off on a quiet residential street and parked with your windows down to do some paperwork.\n\nSuddenly a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a torn t-shirt flapping in the breeze, and wearing one leather glove, moving at probably 80mph on one wheel, and screaming bloody murder roars by and with all his strength throws a live squirrel grenade directly into your police car.\n\nI heard screams. They weren't mine...\n\nI managed to get the big motorcycle under directional control and dropped the front wheel to the ground. I then used maximum braking and skidded to a stop in a cloud of tire smoke at the stop sign at a busy cross street.\n\nI would have returned to fess up (and to get my glove back). I really would have. Really. But for two things. First, the cops did not seem interested or the slightest bit concerned about me at the moment. One of them was on his back in the front yard of the house they had been parked in front of and was rapidly crabbing backwards away from the patrol car. The other was standing in the street and was training a riot shotgun on the police cruiser.\n\nSo the cops were not interested in me. They often insist to \u201clet the professionals handle it\u201d anyway. That was one thing. The other? Well, I swear I could see the squirrel, standing in the back window of the patrol car among shredded and flying pieces of foam and upholstery, and shaking his little fist at me. I think he was shooting me the finger\u2026\n\nThat is one dangerous squirrel. And now he has a patrol car\u2026\n\nI took a deep breath, turned on my turn-signal, made an easy right turn, and sedately left the neighborhood.\n\nAs for my easy and slow drive home? Screw it. Faced with a choice of 80mph cars and inattentive drivers, or the evil, demonic, attack squirrel of death...I\u2019ll take my chances with the freeway. Every time.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll buy myself a new pair of gloves.",

Are you feeling any pain?\" asks the doctor, whilst holding the man in increasinly contorted positions.\u00a0\n\n\n\"No, no... that's not it...\" says the man, sounding more and more frustrated as the doctor fails to find the source of the his problem.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter 10 minutes with no success in identifying the source of the patient's irritation, he slumps back in his seat.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Well, I couldn't find anything obviously wrong with you, the best advice I can offer is to take some ordinary over the counter anti inflammatory medication\"\u00a0\n\n\nThe man looks at the doctor and sighs.\u00a0\n\n\"No, no doctor... you don't understand...

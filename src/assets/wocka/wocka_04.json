The government takes them and puts them in a barn with everyone else's cows. You have to take care of all the cows. The government gives you as much milk as you need.\r\n\r\nBUREAUCRATIC SOCIALISM \r\nYou have two cows. The government takes them and puts them in a barn with everyone else's cows. They are cared for by ex-chicken farmers. You have to take care of the chickens the government took from the chicken farmers. The government gives you as much milk and as many eggs as the regulations say you should need.\r\n\r\nFASCISM\r\nYou have two cows. The government takes both, hires you to take care of them, and sells you the milk.\r\n\r\nPURE COMMUNISM \t\r\nYou have two cows. Your neighbors help you take care of them, and you all share the milk.\r\n\r\nRUSSIAN COMMUNISM\r\nYou have two cows. You have to take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.\r\n\r\nDICTATORSHIP\r\nYou have two cows. The government takes both and shoots you.\r\n\r\nSINGAPORE DEMOCRACY\r\nYou have two cows. The government fines you for keeping two unlicensed animals in an apartment.\r\n\r\nMILITARIANISM\r\nYou have two cows. The government takes both and drafts you.\r\n\r\nPURE DEMOCRACY \r\nYou have two cows. Your neighbors decide who gets the milk.\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY\r\nYou have two cows. Your neighbors pick someone to tell you who gets the milk.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN DEMOCRACY\r\nThe government promises to give you two cows if you vote for it. After the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow futures. The press dubs the affair \"Cowgate\".\r\n\r\nBRITISH DEMOCRACY\r\nYou have two cows. You feed them sheep's brains and they go mad. The government doesn't do anything.\r\n\r\nBUREAUCRACY\r\nYou have two cows. At first the government regulates what you can feed them and when you can milk them. Then it pays you not to milk them. After that it takes both, shoots one, milks the other and pours the milk down the drain. Then it requires you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.\r\n\r\nANARCHY\r\nYou have two cows. Either you sell the milk at a fair price or your neighbors kill you and take the cows.\r\n\r\nCAPITALISM \r\nYou have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull.\r\n\r\nHONG KONG CAPITALISM \r\nYou have two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax deduction for keeping five cows. The milk rights of six cows are transferred via a Panamanian intermediary to a Cayman Islands company secretly owned by the majority shareholder, who sells the rights to all seven cows' milk back to the listed company. The annual report says that the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more. Meanwhile, you kill the two cows because the Feng Shui is bad.\r\n\r\nENVIRONMENTALISM \r\nYou have two cows. The government bans you from milking or killing them.\r\n\r\nFEMINISM \t\r\nYou have two cows. They get married and adopt a veal calf.\r\n\r\nTOTALITARIANISM \t\r\nYou have two cows. The government takes them and denies they ever existed. Milk is banned.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CORRECTNESS \t\r\nYou are associated with (the concept of \"ownership\"is a symbol of the phallo-centric, war-mongering, intolerant past) two differently-aged (but no less valuable to society) bovines of non-specified gender.\r\n\r\nCOUNTER CULTURE \t\r\nWow, dude, there's like... these two cows, man. You got to have some of this milk. Far out! Awesome!\r\n\r\nSURREALISM \t\r\nYou have two giraffes. The government requires you to take harmonica lessons.\r\n\r\nJAPANESE DEMOCRACY \t\r\nYou have two cows. You give the milk to gangsters so they don't ask any awkward questions about who you're giving the milk to.\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN FEDERALISM\r\nYou have two cows which cost too much money to care for because everybody is buying milk imported from some cheap east-European country and would never pay the fortune you'd have to ask for your cows' milk. So you apply for financial aid from the European Union to subsidise your cows and are granted enough subsidies. You then sell your milk at the former elevated price to some government-owned distributor which then dumps your milk onto the market at east-European prices to make Europe competitive. You spend the money you got as a subsidy on two new cows and then go on a demonstration to Brussels complaining that the European farm-policy is going drive you out of your job.\r\n\r\nEASTERN EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY\r\nYou have two cows. You sell the milk (diluted with some water) at a high price to the neighbors or to anyone at the open-air market. If somebody asks for receipt, you charge for a two times higher price, so nobody will request an invoice. For concerned families with small babies you claim that the milk is \"bio\", though you collect the grass for feeding at the side of the highway and you keep the milk in plastic barrels used previously as containers of dangerous chemicals. Later, your neighbor or anybody from town will steal the cows and will buy their meat for a high price, and if you ask for a receipt, you will be charged for a two times higher price.\r\n\r\nFINNISH SOCIALISM\r\nYou have two cows. Soon you have to kill one of them because in the Netherlands there is an overproduction of milk and the European Union rules say so. When you do so, you realize that it was not necessary, only the system was too slow in getting you the up-to-date news. From the stress, you get an ulcer in your stomach so you go to a doctor. The doctor realizes that this ulcer is a serious one, so you need an urgent treatment. Therefore, you soon get a call to the local hospital. The call's date is for 3 months later, because there is a queue with more urgent cases. Then your ulcer becomes even more serious because you remember that 40 percent of your income is taken for social tax.",

The height of the building can then be worked out from the formula H = 0.5g x t squared. But bad luck on the barometer.\r\n\r\n\"Or if the sun is shining you could measure the height of the barometer, then set it on end and measure the length of its shadow. Then you measure the length of the skyscraper's shadow, and thereafter it is a simple matter of proportional arithmetic to work out the height of the skyscraper.\r\n\r\n\"But if you wanted to be highly scientific about it, you could tie a short piece of string to the barometer and swing it like a pendulum, first at ground level and then on the roof of the skyscraper. The height is worked out by the difference in the gravitational restoring force T = 2 pi sqroot (l / g).\r\n\r\n\"Or if the skyscraper has an outside emergency staircase, it would be easier to walk up it and mark off the height of the skyscraper in barometer lengths, then add them up.\r\n\r\n\"If you merely wanted to be boring and orthodox about it, of course, you could use the barometer to measure the air pressure on the roof of the skyscraper and on the ground, and convert the difference in millibars into feet to give the height of the building.\r\n\r\n\"But since we are constantly being exhorted to exercise independence of mind and apply scientific methods, undoubtedly the best way would be to knock on the janitor's door and say to him 'If you would like a nice new barometer, I will give you this one if you tell me the height of this skyscraper.'\"\r\n\r\nThe student was Niels Bohr, the only person from Denmark to win the Nobel prize for Physics.",

The old preacher thinks to himself how awful the situation is, that these young children are already heading down the life of sin and he should do something to stop it.\r\n\r\nThe old preacher pulls over and gets out on the opposite side of the street and starts walking over to the boys. He calls out to the oldest looking one and asked the boy to \"come here\" so that as he's walking towards the boys, the oldest boy would be walking towards him.  When the boy reached him, the old preacher asked him what he was doing.\r\n\r\n\"Gambling, sir\" retorted the boy.\r\n\"Gambling?! How old are you son?\" asked the preacher.\r\n\"I'm 14.\"\r\n\"14?! Well if you turn that around, you'll be 41.  You'll have reached the middle years of your life, and if you stick to gambling in all that time, you'll have thrown your whole life away.  You could have been married, had a successful job, kids, a home, a family, but no. You'll have thought gambling was such a \"good life.\"  Is that what you want?  Did you want to live your life through sin and banished from God's grace?\"\r\n\"N-n-o sir!\" wailed the boy.\r\n\"Good lad. Now head on home son. The lord is smiling to find out you've said no to sin\" the old preacher smiled as the boy went his way down the street.\r\n\r\nHe looked back at the other 2 boys and realized they were still shooting dice. He calls back to the next oldest looking boy and asked him to come closer.\r\n\r\n\"You boy, how old are you son?\" questioned the preacher.\r\n\"I'm 12, sir.\" answered the boy.\r\n\"12?! Well now look here boy. If you turned that around, you'll be 21. You'll have been at the prime of your life.  You'll be halfway through college, seeing a very lovely young lady, talking about starting a family with you.  All these big decisions you'll be facing, and you'll have the heart to make them but not if you continue down this destructive gambling path.  The colleges will turn down your applications because your credit will be bad, and your young lovely lady friend will leave you because you just can't seem to get your finances in order due to this overwhelming problem of yours.  On top of everything the Mighty Lord will be frowning upon your conduct and your choice to live the life of sin. Leave this world behind son. It starts now. Now go on home son! Make the lord proud of you, for his warm smile will be all the coercing you need to leave this life behind.\"\r\n\"Y-y-yes sir!\" said the boy, and he went the opposite way down the street towards his home.\r\n\r\nThe preacher thought his work was done for surely the final boy must have heard his words being said to his friend, but sure enough, when the preacher looked back, there he was, still shooting dice and gambling.\r\n\"I don't believe this!\" he muttered.  \"You boy, come here a second!\"\r\n\r\nThe other boy walked casually toward the preacher.\r\n\r\n\"How old are you son? Let me show you why this gambling life is a bad choice for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good mister, cause I'm 11. I'd much like to hear it!\"",

        "body": "There was a little boy by the name of Billy. Billy was an ordinary little boy who did ordinary little boy things, like playing, eating, bathing, destroying things, and going to school. One day, when Billy went down to the bus stop to meet the bus to go to school, he found all of his friends huddled around in a little group, talking about the Purple Wombat.\r\n\r\nBeing a little boy, Billy was curious. So he asked them, \"What's the Purple Wombat?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know what the Purple Wombat is?\" the children exclaimed disgustedly. For the rest of the morning, they would not go near Billy, always standing far away and staring at him. Then the bus came. Billy, confused, got on the bus along with the rest of the children.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Mister Bus Driver!\" one of the chldren shouted. \"Billy doesn't know what the Purple Wombat is!\"\r\n\r\nThe bus driver turned around abruptly. \"You don't know what the Purple Wombat is?\" he said in disbelief. He ordered Billy to sit in the very back of the bus, all by himself.\r\n\r\nEventually, they got to school, and Billy got off the bus and went to class. Class proceeded normally; the students did the pledge of allegiance and worked on their multiplication tables for a while. Then the teacher led them into a unit on geography. Billy was not really paying attention, but he heard the teacher mention something about the Purple Wombat.\r\n\r\nBilly's hand shot up, and, when the teacher called on him, Billy asked, \"Teacher, what's the Purple Wombat?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know what the Purple Wombat is?\" the teacher cried in alarm, \"Get yourself to the principal's office right now, young man. No, no buts -- march!\"\r\n\r\nSo Billy headed down the long, dark, frightening hallway to the principal's office. He slowly opened the large, heavy door, and timidly entered the room behind it. There, at a large, imposing desk, sat the principal. The principal was a hulking man, balding, with a thin mustache. He spoke in a deep baritone voice. He was enough to frighten little boys like Billy who had been sent to his office almost to tears.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Billy,\" he began slowly. \"What seems to be the problem?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Principal, I just don't know what's going on today. Everyone's been acting weird, and they're all treating me really badly. Like teacher just sent me to you and stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Billy, I'm here to help you. I'm the princi-Pal, after all. Heh heh. Can you tell me why everyone's acting so strangely?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's because I don't know what some stupid Purple Wombat is.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? You don't know what the Purple Wombat is? That's it. I am calling your mother, young man. Consider yourself suspended.\"\r\n\r\nThe principal threw Billy out of his office and told him to go home. Billy, crying, began the long walk home. When he got there, his mother was standing in the doorway waiting for him.\r\n\r\n\"Billy!\" she called, sobbing, \"I was so worried about you! What happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mom,\" Billy cried, \"Everyone was being mean to me and I had to sit in the back of the bus all by myself and the teacher sent me to the principal's office and the principal suspended me, all because I don't know what the Purple Wombat is!\"\r\n\r\n\"What? You don't know what the Purple Wombat is?\" Billy's mother shrieked. \"Go to your room this minute. Go! Just wait until your father gets home!\"\r\n\r\nSo Billy marched up the stairs and into his room. He collapsed on the bed, crying. After some amount of time, he heard a car pull in and some doors shutting. His father was home. He could hear his parents talking downstairs but didn't know what they were saying. Then he heard footsteps coming up the stairs, and his door opened.\r\n\r\n\"Billy,\" his father began in that lecturing-father tone, \"Your mother says you've been acting badly lately. Would you like to tell me what you've done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dad, I haven't done anything! I just don't know what the Purple Wombat is!\"\r\n\r\n\"You...don't know what the Purple Wombat is. Well, in that case, you can just stay in this room all night, mister. And forget about dinner!\"\r\n\r\nBilly's father slammed the door and stormed off. Billy collapsed on his bed, crying his eyes out. He spent the next several hours that way -- lying there, crying, wishing he would wake up.\r\n\r\nThen, in the middle of the night, he heard a voice. It said: \"Billy. I am the Purple Wombat, Billy.\"\r\n\r\nBilly sat up with a start. He looked around the room, trying to find the source of the voice, but he could not.\r\n\r\n\"Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. Find me, Billy.\"\r\n\r\nIt was coming from out the window. So Billy got up, put his shoes on, opened the window, and climbed out on to the roof.\r\n\r\n\"Billy. I am the Purple Wombat.\"\r\n\r\nBilly jumped down off the roof and followed the voice down the road. He got to the edge of a wood.\r\n\r\n\"Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. Follow me, Billy.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice was coming from inside the wood. It was very dark and very frightening, but Billy didn't care. He had to find out what the Purple Wombat was. So, bravely, he entered the wood.\r\n\r\n\"Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. Keep going, Billy.\"\r\n\r\nBilly kept going into the wood. He could hardly see anything, and he kept falling down and walking into things and hurting himself. But he kept going, driven by a need to find this enigma that kept calling his name.\r\n\r\n\"Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. This way, Billy.\"\r\n\r\nEventually, Billy emerged from the wood. He was on the shore of the town lake.\r\n\r\n\"Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. I'm out here, Billy.\"\r\n\r\nIt was coming from out across the lake. Billy got one of the small rowboats from the dock, untied it, and rowed out. Since he was only a small boy, it was very difficult. But he had to find out what the Purple Wombat was.\r\n\r\n\"Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. Row, Billy.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice was coming from across the lake. Billy doubled his effort, and the boat began to move a little faster. When he was about half way across the lake, he heard: \"Billy, I am the Purple Wombat. I'm up here, Billy.\"\r\n\r\nIt was coming from directly above him. Billy stopped rowing and stood up to look for it. The boat tipped over, dumping him in the lake. Billy didn't know how to swim, so he drowned.\r\n\r\nMoral: Don't stand up in a boat.",

He also wrote numerous books on criminal justice.

Times were changing, he was told, and the school demanded that faculty members hold a graduate degree.

All new faculty were being required to hold a doctorate, it was explained, and the school was actually doing him a favor by letting him keep his job by getting \"only\" a master's degree.\r\n\r\nSo John enrolled in a summer program at an out of state college.

He then, making sure no one was looking, secretly took from his pocket some milk duds and started popping them in his mouth making it obvious to the rest of the kids as possible by making yum yum noises.\r\n\r\nThe bully, without asking, snatched the jar from Ken's hand and asked, \"What's in the bottle that you are making such a big deal of?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they're smart pills.\"\r\n\r\n\"Smart pills?\" the bully asked, then opened the jar and popped a couple of the foreign brown balls in his mouth. \"Pweeuuweppblahhh!\" he reacted. \"What is this stuff?

All of a sudden a whoosh of freezing air started blowing from vents all around the car, and within seconds the automobile was not only comfortable, it was quite cool!\r\n\r\n\"This is amazing!\" exclaimed Ford. \"How much do you want for the patent?\"\r\n\r\nNorman spoke up. \"The price is one million dollars.\" Then he paused, \"And there is something else. We want the name 'Greenberg Brothers Air Conditioning' to be stamped right next to the Ford logo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Money is no problem,\" retorted Ford, \"but no way will I have a Jewish name next to my logo on my cars!\"\r\n\r\nThey haggled back and forth for a while and finally they settled. One and one half million dollars, and the name Greenberg would be left off. However, the first names of the Greenberg brothers would be forever emblazoned upon the console of every Ford air conditioning system.\r\n\r\nAnd that is why today, whenever you enter a Ford vehicle you will see those three names clearly defined on the air-conditioning control panel:\r\n\r\nHI  NORM  MAX",

        "body": "BETTER HOLD ON TO THOSE PANTIES...THEY COULD COME IN HANDY\r\n\r\nA repeat offender got a life sentence for a small-time shoplifting caper in Jupiter, Florida. The man stole $49.73 worth of boxer shorts, panties, a sports bra and some cigarette lighters from a Wal-Mart store. His fatal mistake was flashing a knife at a security guard - which turned his petty theft into a felony. Since the man had been released from prison less than three years ago, Florida's repeat offender law required the judge to send him away for life without the possibility of parole.\r\n\r\nINSULT TO INJURY\r\n\r\nAn unemployed sanitation worker in Miami is also facing life in prison - for shooting himself in the privates. In a drunken stupor, the man reached for a pistol he had hidden in his pants. The gun went off, and the bullet struck the man in the... nuggets. At first, he told officers someone else had shot him, but changed his story after paramedics found the shell casing in his underwear. Cops ruled the shooting accidental, but the man was charged with a concealed weapons violation and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The maximum sentence for those crimes is normally 15 years but, because the man has a record as a violent career criminal, a Miami prosecutor is asking the judge to send him away for life. The man's public defender calls that \"ridiculous,\" and says the man's injury is punishment enough.\r\n\r\nHEY - WHAT ABOUT MY ACCOMPLICE?\r\n\r\nA luckless thief pleaded guilty to the attempted robbery of a convenience store in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota. The thief told a passerby he was going to rob the store, gave the man a dollar, and asked him to go inside and buy a scarf to hide his identity during the crime. The bystander took the dollar, went inside the store... and called the police.\r\n\r\nOOPS! OF THE WEEK\r\n\r\nA thief in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina has learned a valuable lesson: if you're going to steal restaurant equipment, be sure to remove pictures of the original owner's grandchildren before setting the stuff up in your own restaurant. John Ubbing, owner of Giovanni's Pizzeria in Calabash, North Carolina, lost an assortment of pizza-making equipment in a March robbery. A refrigerator stolen in the heist later turned up inside the Myrtle Beach restaurant - where cops found pictures of Ubbing's grandchildren still stuck to the side of it. The owner of the second restaurant was arrested.\r\n\r\nI TOLDJA COMPUTERS WERE RUINING AMERICA!\r\n\r\nDuring a high school break-in in Plymouth, North Carolina, two burglars found a camera in one of the classrooms and amused themselves by taking pictures of each other committing the crime. When they couldn't figure out how to get the film out of the camera, they concluded it wasn't loaded and left it behind. The men apparently didn't realize they'd been fooling around with a digital camera that stores pictures on a computer disk. Investigators downloaded the snapshots to a computer and got a complete photographic record of the break-in. The suspects were quickly arrested.\r\n\r\nI THOUGHT THIS'D BE THE LAST PLACE THEY'D LOOK...!\r\n\r\nA Nevada fugitive wanted on fraud charges was arrested in Connecticut after he blew his cover by applying for a job... as a police officer. The Connecticut cops discovered the man's fugitive status during a standard background check. He had passed both the written and agility tests before being found out. Police called the man in to headquarters under the guise of getting his fingerprints, and served him with an arrest warrant instead.\r\n\r\nAND FINALLY...\r\n\r\nAdmitting his 0-4 records are not impressive \"on paper,\" trainers announced that Lucky, a German shepherd guide dog for the blind in Wuppertal, Germany, is available for his fifth owner. Lucky led his first owner in front of a bus, \r\nkilling him. Then he led the second off the end of a pier, drowning him. He nudged his third owner off a railway platform in front of an express train, killing him. And he walked his fourth owner into heavy traffic, abandoning him \r\nto be hit and killed. The new owner won't be told of Lucky's record - the trainers say the dog might sense nervousness \"and do something silly.\"",

        "body": "Subject: 1997 Darwin Award Winner!!! For those who don't know, this award is an annual honor given to the person who did the gene pool the biggest service by killing themselves in the most extraordinarily stupid way; thus, eliminating his/her genetic material from the gene pool.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who do know about the award, you may recall last year's Darwin Award winner: the man who found out moments before making a 300 MPH dent in an Arizona cliff that the JATO (Jet Assist Take-Off) unit he'd strapped to his car was not equipped with an off switch. 1995's winner was the fellow who was killed by a Coke machine which fell on top of him as he was attempting to tip a free soda out of it.\r\n\r\nAnd now, I am pleased to present 1997's illustrious winners of the Darwin Award, John Pernicky and Sal Hawkins. Yes, for the first time, it was a tie!\r\n\r\nJohn Pernicky and friend Sal Hawkins, of the great state of Washington, decided to attend a local Metallica concert at the Amphitheater at George, Washington. Having no tickets (but 18 beers among them) they sat in the parking lot, and after finishing the beer, decided that it would be easy enough to hop over the nine-foot high fence and sneak into the show.\r\n\r\nThe two friends pulled their pickup truck over to the fence and the plan was for John -- 100 pounds heavier than Sal - to hop over, and then assist his friend over the fence. Unfortunately for John, there was a 30 foot drop on the other side of the fence. Having heaved himself over, he found himself crashing through a tree. His fall was abruptly halted by a large branch which snagged him by his shorts.\r\n\r\nDangling from the tree, with one arm broken, John looked down and saw a group of bushes below him. Figuring the bushes would break his fall, John removed his pocket knife and proceeded to cut away his shorts to free himself from the tree. When finally free, John crashed below into Holly bushes. The sharp leaves scratched his entire body and now being without his shorts, he was the unwilling victim of a holly branch penetrating his rectal cavity.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, his pocket knife proceeded to fall with him and landed three inches into his left thigh. Seeing his friend in considerable pain and agony, Sal decided to throw him a rope and pull him to safety.\r\n\r\nHowever, weighing about 100 pounds less, he decided the best course of action would be to tie the rope to the pickup truck. This is when things went from bad to worse.\r\n\r\nIn his drunken state, Sal put the truck into the wrong gear, pressed on the gas, and crashed through the fence, landing on, and killing, his friend. Sal was thrown from the truck, suffered massive internal injuries, and also died at the scene.\r\n\r\nPolice arrived to find a pickup truck with its driver thrown 100 feet from the vehicle and, upon moving the truck, a half naked man with numerous scratches, a holly stick up his rectum, a knife in his thigh, and a pair of shorts dangling from the tree branches 25 feet in the air.\r\n\r\nCongratulations John and Sal!!!\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------- And now, the runners-up:\r\n\r\nRunner-Up #1 - San Jose Mercury News:\r\n\r\nAn unidentified man, using a shotgun like a club to break a former girlfriend's windshield, accidentally shot himself to death when the gun discharged, blowing a hole in his gut.\r\n\r\nRunner-Up #2 - Kalamazoo Gazette:\r\n\r\nJames Burns, 34, of Alamo, Mich., was killed in March as he was trying to repair what police described as a \"farm-type truck.\" Burns got a friend to drive the truck on a highway while Burns hung underneath so that he could ascertain the source of a troubling noise. Burns' clothes caught on something, however, and the other man found Burns \"wrapped in the drive shaft.\"\r\n\r\nRunner-Up #3 - Reuters, Mississauga, Ontario:\r\n\r\nA man cleaning a bird feeder on his balcony of his condominium apartment in this Toronto suburb slipped and fell 23 stories to his death, police said Monday. Stefan Macko, 55, was standing on a wheeled chair Sunday when the accident occurred, said Inspector D'Arcy Honer of the Peel regional police. \"It appears the chair moved and he went over the balcony,\" Honer said. \"It's one of those freak accidents. No foul play is suspected.\"\r\n\r\nRunner-Up #4 - Hickory Daily Record:\r\n\r\nKen Charles Barger, 47, accidentally shot himself to death in December in Newton, N.C., when, awakening to the sound of a ringing telephone beside his bed, he reached for the phone but grabbed instead a Smith & Wesson .38 Special, which discharged when he drew it to his ear.\r\n\r\nRunner-Up #5 - UPI, Toronto:\r\n\r\nPolice said a lawyer demonstrating the safety of windows in a downtown Toronto skyscraper crashed through a pane with his shoulder and plunged 24 floors to his death. A police spokesman said Garry Hoy, 39, fell into the courtyard of the Toronto Dominion Bank Tower early Friday evening as he was explaining the strength of the building's windows to visiting law students. Hoy previously had conducted demonstrations of window strength according to police reports. Peter Lauwers, managing partner of the firm Holden Day Wilson, told the Toronto Sun newspaper that Hoy was \"one of the best and brightest\" members of the 200-man association.\r\n\r\nRunners-Up #6 - AP, Cairo, Egypt:\r\n\r\nSix people drowned Monday while trying to rescue a chicken that had fallen into a well in southern Egypt. An 18-year-old farmer was the first to descend into the 60-foot well. He drowned, apparently after an undercurrent in the water pulled him down, police said. His sister and two brothers, none of whom could swim well, went in one-by-one to help him, but also drowned. Two elderly farmers then came to help, but they apparently were pulled by the same undercurrent. The bodies of the six were later pulled out of the well in the village of Nazlat Imara, 240 miles south of Cairo. The chicken was also pulled out. It survived.\r\n\r\nRunner-Up #7 - Bloomburg News Service:\r\n\r\nA terrible diet and room with no ventilation are being blamed for the death of a man who was killed by his own gas. There was no mark on his body but autopsy showed large amounts of methane gas in his system. His diet had consisted primarily of beans and cabbage (and a couple of other things). It was just the right combination of foods. It appears that the man died in his sleep from breathing from the poisonous cloud that was hanging over his bed. Had he been outside or had his windows been opened, it wouldn't have been fatal. But the man was shut up in his near airtight bedroom. He was \"...a big man with a huge capacity for creating [this deadly gas].\" Three of the rescuers got sick and one was hospitalized.\r\n\r\nRunner-Up #9 - San Jose Mercury News:\r\n\r\nA 24-year-old salesman from Hialeah, Fla., was killed near Lantana, Fla., in March when his car smashed into a pole in the median strip of Interstate 95 in the middle of the afternoon. Police said that the man was traveling at 80 MPH and, judging by the sales manual that was found open and clutched to his chest, had been busy reading.\r\n\r\nRunner-Up #10 - The News of the Weird:\r\n\r\nMichael Anderson Godwin made News of the Weird posthumously in 1989. He had spent several years awaiting South Carolina's electric chair on a murder conviction before having his sentence reduced to life in prison. In March 1989, sitting on a metal toilet in his cell and attempting to fix his small TV set, he bit into a wire and was electrocuted. On Jan 1, 1997, Laurence Baker, also a convicted murderer once on death row, but later serving a life sentence at the state prison in Pittsburgh, Pa., was electrocuted by his homemade earphones as he watched his small TV while sitting on his metal toilet.\r\n\r\nRunner-Up #11 - The Indianapolis Star:\r\n\r\nIn Dunkirk, Indiana, a Jay County man using a cigarette lighter to check the barrel of a muzzle loader was killed Monday night when the weapon discharged in his face, sheriff's investigators said. Gregory David Pryor, 19, died in his parents' rural Dunkirk home about 11:30 p.m. Investigators said Pryor was cleaning a .54-caliber muzzleloader that had not been firing properly. He was using the lighter to look into the barrel when the gunpowder ignited.\r\n\r\nRunner-Up #12 - AP, Mammoth Lakes:\r\n\r\nA San Anselmo man died yesterday when he hit a lift tower at the Mammoth Mountain ski area while riding down the slope on a foam pad, authorities said. Matthew David Hubal, 22, was pronounced dead at Centinela Mammoth Hospital. The accident occurred about 3 a.m., the Mono County Sheriff's Department said. Hubal and his friends apparently had hiked up a ski run called Stump Alley and undid some yellow foam protectors from the lift towers, said Lieutenant Mike Donnelly of the Mammoth Lakes Police Department. The pads are used to protect skiers who might hit the towers. The group apparently used the pads to slide down the ski slope and Hubal crashed into a tower. [Editor's note: After this initial story was printed, it was determined by investigators that the tower he hit was the one from which HE had removed the pad.]\r\n\r\nRunner-Up #13 - Reuters, Warsaw, Poland:\r\n\r\nA poacher electrocuting fish in a lake in central Poland fell into the water and suffered the same fate as his quarry, police said Thursday. The 24-year-old man was one of four who went fishing with a cable, one end of which they attached to a net and the other to a high-voltage electricity supply line, the PAP news agency quoted a police official in Wloclawek as saying. \"For a while everything went according to the poachers' plan and they had fish in their bags. But at a certain moment the man holding the net tripped and fell into the water,\" the agency said. The other poachers tried in vain to revive him, it said.\r\n\r\nRunner-Up #14 - AP, St. Louis, MO:\r\n\r\nRobert Puelo, 32, was apparently being disorderly in a St. Louis market. When the clerk threatened to call police, Puelo grabbed a hot dog, shoved it in his mouth, and walked out without paying for it. Police found him unconscious in front of the store. Paramedics removed the six-inch wiener from his throat, where it had choked him to death.\r\n\r\nRunner-Up #15 - Unknown:\r\n\r\nPoacher Marino Malerba shot a stag standing above him on an aging rock. Mario was killed instantly when the stag fell off the rock and landed on him.\r\n\r\nRunner-Up #16 - Associated Press, Kincaid, W. VA:\r\n\r\nBlasting Cap Explodes in Man's Mouth at Party. A man at a party popped a blasting cap into his mouth and bit down, triggering an explosion that blew off his lips, teeth and tongue, state police said Wednesday. Jerry Stromyer, 24, of Kincaid, bit the blasting cap as a prank during a party late Tuesday night, said Cpl. M.D. Payne. \"Another man had it in an aquarium, hooked to a battery, and was trying to explode it,\" Payne said. \"It wouldn't go off and this guy said, 'I'll show you how to set it off.' I just can't imagine anyone doing something like that,\" Payne said.\r\n\r\nAND FINALLY, Runner-Up #17 - Fort Worth Star-Telegram:\r\n\r\nIn December near Mineral Wells, Tex., three men who were attempting to steal copper wire off live electrical lines for resale were electrocuted. Copper wiring is a valuable scrap metal in Texas but is usually stolen from electric cables that are not being used.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------- Here are some people that may be future nominees/winners, but still haven't made it to the \"Big Leagues.\"\r\n\r\nUPI, Portland, OR:\r\n\r\n[Mountain Men Initiations are Eye-Opening Experience.]\r\n\r\nDoctors at Portland's University Hospital said Wednesday an Oregon man shot through the skull by a hunting arrow is lucky to be alive, and will be released soon from the hospital. Tony Roberts, 25, lost his right eye last weekend during an initiation into a men's rafting club, Mountain Men Anonymous, in Grants Pass, Ore. A friend tried to shoot a beer can off his head, but the arrow entered Roberts' right eye. Doctors said, had the arrow gone 1 millimeter to the left, a major blood vessel would have cut and Roberts would have died instantly. Neurosurgeon Dr. Johnny Delashaw at the University Hospital in Portland said the arrow went through 8 to 10 inches of brain, with the tip protruding at the rear of his skill, yet somehow managed to miss all major blood vessels. Delashaw also said had Robert tried to pull the arrow out on his own he surely would have killed himself. Roberts admitted afterwards he and his friends had been drinking that afternoon. Said Roberts, \"I feel so dumb about this.\" No charges have been filed but the Josephine County district attorney's office said the initiation stunt is under investigation.\r\n\r\nThe Calgary Sun Saturday, Vancouver (CP):\r\n\r\n[Low Blow for Gunman.]\r\n\r\nA man arguing over a love triangle accidentally shot himself in the groin, taking off his testicles and part of his penis. Police said the man was waving a .357 Magnum revolver around during the shouting match early yesterday. But when he stuffed it back in his pants the gun went off. Police were called to the hospital after the man in his 20s was brought in by friends. Charges are pending against the victim, who is expected to survive.\r\n\r\nArkansas Democrat Gazette:\r\n\r\n[Two Local Men Injured in Freak Truck Accident; Cotton Patch, Ark.]\r\n\r\nTwo local men were seriously injured when their pick-up truck left the road and struck a tree near Cotton Patch on State Highway 38 early Monday morning. Woodruff County deputy Dovey Snyder reported the accident shortly after midnight Monday. Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc and Billy Ray Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are listed in serious condition at Baptist Medical Center. The accident occurred as the two men were returning to Des Arc after a frog gigging trip. On an overcast Sunday night, Poole's pick-up truck headlights malfunctioned. The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on the older model truck had burned out. As a replacement fuse was not available, Wallis noticed that the...22 caliber bullet from his pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next to the steering wheel column. Upon inserting the bullet, the headlights again began to operate properly and the two men proceeded on, east-bound toward the White River bridge. After traveling approximately twenty miles and just before crossing the river, the bullet apparently overheated, discharged, and struck Poole in the right testicle. The vehicle swerved sharply to the right exiting the pavement and striking a tree. Poole suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from the accident, but will require surgery to repair the other wound. Wallis sustained a broken clavicle and was treated and released. \"Thank God we weren't on that bridge when Thurston shot his nuts off or we might both be dead,\" stated Wallis. \"I've been a trooper for ten years in this part of the world, but this is a first for me. I can't believe that those two would admit how this accident happened\", said Deputy Snyder. Upon being notified of the wreck, Lavinia, Poole's wife, asked how many frogs the boys had caught and did anyone get them from the truck.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------- This last one is the original 1997 Darwin Award winner; however, he had to be disqualified since he didn't meet the criteria (i.e. he's still in the gene pool, albeit the VERY shallow end).\r\n\r\nLos Angeles Times:\r\n\r\n[I Can See Clearly Now....]\r\n\r\nLarry Waters of Los Angeles had a boyhood dream - to fly. When he graduated from high school, he joined the Air Force in hopes of becoming a pilot. Unfortunately, poor eyesight disqualified him. When he was finally discharged, he had to satisfy himself with watching jets fly over his backyard. One day, Larry, had a bright idea. He decided to fly. He went to the local Army-Navy surplus store and purchased 45 weather balloons and several tanks of helium. The weather balloons, when fully inflated, would measure more than four feet across. Back home, Larry securely strapped the balloons to his sturdy lawn chair. He anchored the chair to the bumper of his jeep and inflated the balloons with the helium. He climbed on for a test while it was still only a few feet above the ground. Satisfied it would work, Larry packed several sandwiches and a six-pack of Miller Lite, loaded his pellet gun-figuring he could pop a few balloons when it was time to descend-and went back to the floating lawn chair. He tied himself in, along with his pellet gun and provisions. Larry's plan was to lazily float up to a height of about 30 feet above his back yard after severing the anchor, and in a few hours come back down. Things didn't quite work out that way. When he cut the cord anchoring the lawn chair to his jeep, he didn't float lazily up to 30 or so feet. Instead he streaked into the LA sky as if shot from a cannon. He didn't level off at 30 feet, nor did he level off at 100 feet. After climbing and climbing, he leveled off at 11,000 feet! At that height he couldn't risk shooting any of the balloons, lest he unbalance the load and really find himself in trouble. So he stayed there, drifting, cold and frightened, for more than 14 hours. Then he really got into trouble. He found himself drifting into the primary approach corridor of Los Angeles International Airport. A United pilot first spotted Larry. He radioed the tower and described passing a guy in a lawn chair with a gun! Radar confirmed the existence of an object floating 11,000 feet above the airport. LAX emergency procedures swung into full alert, and a helicopter was dispatched to investigate. LAX is right on the ocean. Night was falling and the offshore breeze began to flow. It carried Larry out to sea with the helicopter in hot pursuit. Several miles out, the helicopter caught up with Larry. Once the crew determined that Larry was not dangerous, they attempted to close in for a rescue but the draft from the blades would push Larry away whenever they neared. Finally, the helicopter ascended to a position several hundred feet above Larry and lowered a rescue line. Larry snagged the line and was hauled back to shore. The difficult maneuver was flawlessly executed by the helicopter crew.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------- Finally, a story about a woman who would lose a battle-of-wits with Forest Gump.\r\n\r\nAP, Arkansas:[Pillsbury Dough Boy Wanted for Attempted Murder]\r\n\r\nA woman named Linda went to Arkansas last week to visit her in-laws, and while there, went to a store. She parked next to a car with a woman sitting in it, her eyes closed and hands behind her head, apparently sleeping.\r\n\r\nWhen Linda came out a while later, she again saw the woman, her hands still behind her head but with her eyes open. The woman looked very strange, so Linda tapped on the window and said \"Are you okay?\"\r\n\r\nThe woman answered \"I've been shot in the head, and I am holding my brains in.\" Linda didn't know what to do; so she ran into the store where store officials called the paramedics. They had to break into the car because the door was locked.\r\n\r\nWhen they got in, they found that the woman had bread dough on the back of her head and in her hands. A Pillsbury biscuit canister had exploded, apparently from the heat in the car, making a loud explosion like that of a gunshot, and hit her in the head. When she reached back to find what it was, she felt the dough and thought it was her brains. She passed out from fright at first, then attempted to hold her brains in!",

        "body": "DARWIN AWARD RUNNERS-UP:\r\n\r\n#1 - LOS ANGELES, CA. Ani Saduki, 33, and his brother decided to remove a bees' nest from a shed on their property with the aid of a pineapple. A pineapple is an illegal firecracker which is the explosive equivalent of one half stick of dynamite. They ignited the fuse and retreated to watch from inside their home, behind a window some 10 feet away from the hive/shed. The concussion of the explosion shattered the window inwards, seriously lacerating Ani. Deciding Mr. Saduki needed stitches, the brothers headed out to go to a nearby hospital. While walking towards their car, Ani was stung three times by the surviving bees. Unbeknownst to either brother, Ani was allergic to bee venom, and died of suffocation en-route to the hospital.\r\n\r\n#2 - Derrick L. Richards, 28, was charged in April in Minneapolis with third- degree murder in the death of his beloved cousin, Kenneth E. Richards. According to police, Derrick suggested a game of Russian roulette and put a semiautomatic pistol (instead of the more traditional revolver) to Ken's head and fired.\r\n\r\n#3 - PHILLIPSBURG, NJ. An unidentified 29 year old male choked to death on a sequined pastie he had orally removed from an exotic dancer at a local establishment. \"I didn't think he was going to eat it,\" the dancer identified only as \"Ginger\" said, adding \"He was really drunk.\"\r\n\r\n#4 - In February, according to police in WINDSOR, ONT., Daniel Kolta, 27, and Randy Taylor, 33, died in a head-on collision, thus earning a tie in the game of chicken they were playing with their snowmobiles.\r\n\r\n#5 - MOSCOW, Russia -A drunk security man asked a colleague at the Moscow bank they were guarding to stab his bulletproof vest to see if it would protect him against a knife attack. It didn't, and the 25-year-old guard died of a heart wound. (It's good to see the Russians getting into the spirit of the Darwin Awards.)\r\n\r\n#6 - In FRANCE, Jacques LeFevrier left nothing to chance when he decided to commit suicide. He stood at the top of a tall cliff and tied a noose around his neck. He tied the other end of the rope to a large rock. He drank some poison and set fire to his clothes. He even tried to shoot himself at the last moment. He jumped and fired the pistol. The bullet missed him completely and cut through the rope above him. Free of the threat of hanging, he plunged into the sea. The sudden dunking extinguished the flames and made him vomit the poison. He was dragged out of the water by a kind fisherman and was taken to a hospital, where he died of hypothermia.\r\n\r\n#7 - RENTON, WASHINGTON, USA. A Renton, Washington man tried to commit a robbery. This was probably his first attempt, as suggested by the fact that he had no previous record of violent crime, and by his terminally stupid choices as listed below:\r\n\r\n1. The target was H&J Leather & Firearms... a gun shop. 2. The shop was full of customers, in a state where a substantial portion of the adult population is licensed to carry concealed handguns in public places. 3. To enter the shop, he had to step around a marked Police patrol car parked at the front door. 4. An officer in uniform was standing next to the counter, having coffee before reporting to duty.\r\n\r\nUpon seeing the officer, the would-be robber announced a holdup and fired a few wild shots. The officer and a clerk promptly returned fire, removing him from the gene pool. Several other customers also drew their guns, but didn't fire. No one else was hurt.\r\n\r\nAND THE 1998 DARWIN AWARD WINNER IS..... THOMPSON, MANITOBA, CANADA.\r\n\r\nTelephone relay company night watchman Edward Baker, 31, was killed early Christmas morning by excessive microwave radiation exposure. He was apparently attempting to keep warm next to a telecommunications feed horn. Baker had been suspended on a safety violation once last year, according to Northern Manitoba Signal Relay spokesperson Tanya Cooke. She noted that Baker's earlier infraction was for defeating a safety shut-off switch and entering a restricted maintenance catwalk in order to stand in front of the microwave dish. He had told coworkers that it was the only way he could stay warm during his twelve-hour shift at the station, where winter temperatures often dip to forty below zero. Microwaves can heat water molecules within human tissue in the same way that they heat food in microwave ovens. For his Christmas shift, Baker reportedly brought a twelve pack of beer and a plastic lawn chair, which he positioned directly in line with the strongest microwave beam. Baker had not been told about a tenfold boost in microwave power planned that night to handle the anticipated increase in holiday long-distance calling traffic. Baker's body was discovered by the daytime watchman, John Burns, who was greeted by an odor he mistook for a Christmas roast he thought Baker must have prepared as a surprise. Burns also reported to NMSR company officials that Baker's unfinished beers had exploded.\r\n\r\nand the add-on - perhaps a distant runner-up\r\n\r\nVermont native, Ronald Demuth, found himself in a difficult position yesterday. While touring the Eagle's Rock African Safari (Zoo) with a group of thespians from St. Petersburg, Russia, Demuth went overboard to show them one of America's many marvels. He demonstrated the effectiveness of \"Crazy Glue\" ... the hard way. Apparently, Demuth wanted to demonstrate just how good the adhesive was, so he put about 3 ounces of the adhesive in the palms of his hands, and jokingly placed them on the buttocks of a passing rhino. The rhino, a resident of the zoo for the past thirteen years, was not initially startled as it has been part of the petting exhibit since its arrival as a baby. However, once it became aware of its being involuntarily stuck to Demuth, it began to panic and ran around the petting area wildly making Demuth an unintended passenger. \"Sally (the rhino) hasn't been feeling well lately. She had been very constipated. We had just given her a laxative and some depressants to relax her bowels, when Demuth played his juvenile prank,\" said James Douglass, caretaker. During Sally's tirade two fences were destroyed, a shed wall was gored, and a number of small animals escaped. Also, during the stampede, three pygmy goats and one duck were stomped to death. As for Demuth, it took a team of medics and zoo caretakers over four hours to remove his hands from the rhino's buttocks. First, the animal had to be captured and calmed down. However, during this process the laxatives began to take hold and Demuth was repeatedly showered with over 30 gallons of liquid rhino offal. \"It was tricky. We had to calm her down, while at the same time shield our faces from being pelted with rhino dung. I guess you could say that Demuth was into it up to his neck. Once she was under control, we had three people with shovels working to keep an air passage open for Mr. Demuth. We were able to tranquilize her and apply a solvent to remove his hands from her rear,\" said Douglass. \"I don't think he'll be playing with Crazy Glue for a while.\" Meanwhile, the Russians, while obviously amused, also were impressed with the power of the adhesive. \"I'm going to buy some for my children, but of course they can't take it to the zoo,\" commented Vladimir Zolnikov, leader of the troupe.",

Refuse to do the paper on account of the fact that you are a member of Greenpeace and strongly object to the gratuitous slaughter of trees caused by the massive amount of paper used in writing assignments.\r\n\r\n30. Put nonsense words down as quotes. Say that you are quoting the words of a well-known Zen master who was speaking in tongues at the time.\r\n\r\n31.

Staple a picture of an academic building to the paper. Cite the picture as a resource.\r\n\r\n38. On the day the paper is due, skip into class, waving the paper and screaming, \"I have a paper!

        "body": "1. Introduction\r\n\r\nThe following is a manual of guidelines for the busy cat(s) who will have a house to manage after adopting one or more humans. It is, of course, impossible to cover all possible situations, as those humans are always up to some sort of \r\nmischief, but the compiler and contributors to this guide have endeavored to cover as wide a variety of topics as possible. It is important that this document be kept out of the hands of humans, who will undoubtedly find a way to \r\nuse it to their advantage.\r\n\r\n2. Food\r\n\r\nIn order to get the energy to sleep, play, and hamper, a cat must eat. Eating, however, is only half the fun. The other half is getting the food. Cats have two ways to obtain food: convincing a human you are starving to death and must be fed now; and hunting for it oneself. The following are some guidelines for getting fed.\r\n\r\na) When the humans are eating, make sure you leave the tip of your tail in their dishes when they are not looking.\r\n\r\nb) Never eat food from your own bowl if you can steal some from the table.\r\n\r\nc) Never drink from your own water bowl if a human's glass is full enough to drink from.\r\n\r\nd) The best times to inform humans of your dish's emptiness are when they are unable to ignore you, such as when they are sleeping or on the toilet. If you insist on waking a human at what it considers a \"ridiculously early hour\" for \r\nbreakfast, be warned that the human may be as likely to throw you outside or in the basement as to feed you.\r\n\r\ne) Should you catch something of your own outside, it is only polite to attempt to get to know it. Be insistent; your food will usually not be so polite and try to leave. If you can't be bothered to eat the food you've just caught, be considerate and don't waste it; it makes a perfect gift for humans! Carefully pick it up and carry it to the human's house and, if the door is closed, leave \r\nit on the doorstep. If the door is open, or there is a cat-flap, take it inside and leave it somewhere highly visible. The gift will be even welcomer if it is still alive! Live birds and mice make the best gifts as humans love a good game of chase just as much as you do, although be careful not to help them; it's their gift after all.\r\n\r\nf) Table scraps are delicacies with which the humans are unfortunately unwilling to readily part. It is beneath the Dignity of a cat to beg outright for food as lower forms of life such as dogs will, but several techniques exist \r\nfor ensuring that the humans don't forget you exist. These include, but are not limited to: jumping onto the lap of the \"softest\" human and purring loudly; lying down in the doorway between the dining room and the kitchen, the Direct \r\nStare, and twining around people's legs as they sit and eat while meowing plaintively.\r\n\r\ng) Coffee is known to be rejuvenating for both cats and humans. \r\nWhenever a human sets a cup of coffee on the floor within your reach, s/he is \r\nshowing you great respect and worship. Softly blow the divine liquid until cool \r\n(you may even put your paw in it to make sure the temperature is just right) and \r\nthen daintily drink it.\r\n\r\nh) Occasionally there will be disagreements over what you and the humans will \r\ndeem as edible. The appropriate action, should the stuff in question be too \r\nrepulsive to ignore, is to bury it. Scratch at the floor and try to drag over \r\nobjects to cover the offending item. This informs the ignorant human that it \r\nreally belongs in the litter box.\r\n\r\n2.1 Catnip\r\n\r\nMost cats think that this strange-looking plant is Food of the Gods and better \r\neven than tuna. There are some, however, who are sadly deprived of the ability \r\nto enjoy this wonderful treat and will look upon the others with a mixture of \r\nconfusion and disgust at the utter lack of Dignity of those partaking. If you \r\nare one of the latter, please skip to the next section.\r\n\r\nCatnip is available in two forms, in the wild as an odd-looking plant that \r\ngrows in delightfully fragrant, though often rather flattened, patches, and from \r\nthe humans in a concentrated dried form. Unfortunately, the humans know of our \r\nweakness for catnip and will try to hold it out from us, often employing some \r\nvery ingenious methods to do so. If the humans are careless enough to leave any \r\ncatnip within reach, it is imperative to get it no matter what you have to tear \r\napart to do so. Otherwise the humans will use it to attempt to coerce us to do \r\nthings, which would otherwise be beneath us.\r\n\r\nThe greatest hazard of catnip is that it causes those cats under its influence \r\nto utterly lose their Dignity. They roll around foolishly, purr at maximum \r\nvolume, tear around the house at top speed, and do other things no sane cat \r\nwould be caught doing. Do attempt to control yourself, especially if your humans \r\nhave a \"video camera\" and are prone to using it.\r\n\r\n3. Water\r\n\r\nWater (also known as Cat Solvent) would be really great if it wasn't so wet! \r\nDripping taps are the best sources of fresh water in the whole house. Toilets \r\nare the next best (but the water inside must be colorless and contain nothing!) \r\nTherefore it is imperative that any sound of running water be immediately \r\ninvestigated in case a free drink may be obtained. The bathtub is the best place \r\nto lurk in the bathroom when a human is present. A plaintive meow or two and \r\nperhaps hopefully licking the faucet usually will get most humans to turn on the \r\ntap for you. If the bathroom door is closed, demand entry noisily (see Doors). \r\nThe water dish is to be used only as a last resort in case the humans leave the \r\ntoilet lid down and the tub and sink are dry.\r\n\r\nIf a human has a sufficiently wide-mouthed glassful of liquid, immediately \r\nstick your face into the glass. If the opening is too narrow, dip your paw into \r\nthe liquid, swirl it around, and give it the taste test. You may be pleasantly \r\nsurprised to find beer or even milk! In any case, if the liquid is good, \r\ncontinue to sample, but only while you're human is distracted. Some of the best \r\nwater is ornamented with those cold, hard buoyant cubes that bob up and down in \r\nthe liquid when pressed lightly. If your human protests, lick the condensation \r\non the outside of the glass.\r\n\r\n4. Sleeping\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, in order to have enough energy for playing; a cat must get \r\nplenty of sleep. It is generally not difficult to find a comfortable place to \r\ncurl up. Any place a human likes to sit is good, especially if it contrasts with \r\nyour fur color. If it's in a sunbeam or near a heating duct or radiator, so much \r\nthe better. Of course, good places also exist outdoors, but have the \r\ndisadvantages of being seasonal and dependent on current and previous weather \r\nconditions such as rain. Open windows are a good compromise.\r\n\r\nA) Snoring is not a talent unique to humans; if the cat is sharing a bed with \r\ntwo humans, the well skilled cat can cause one of the humans to be \r\nblamed/swatted/smacked for the deed by the other.\r\n\r\nB) If your humans don't let you into the bedroom at night, make them suffer \r\nfor it. Even if they give you a nice warm room of your own to sleep in at night, \r\nwith a cat flap to the outside world that just isn't good enough. There are \r\nseveral ways of registering your disapproval.\r\n\r\na) Trash the room they give you to sleep in. After all, the humans don't sleep \r\nin it, so why should you?\r\n\r\nb) Fight noisily with other cats in the neighborhood, just outside their \r\nbedroom window. Make sure that you appear in the morning with as many fresh \r\nscars as possible. Spend some time perfecting an aggrieved \"Well, I wouldn't \r\nhave all these injuries if you only let me sleep in the bedroom at night\" \r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nc) When they finally rise and take a shower or a bath, locate the \r\nappropriate drainpipe and yowl up it. That amplified and disembodied \"Meow\" is \r\nsure to surprise them, as is the length of time you can do this without getting \r\nhoarse.\r\n\r\nd) When they finally come downstairs, and call for you, refuse to use \r\nthe cat flap to enter the house. There's a perfectly good front door they can \r\nopen. Of course, if they should anticipate you by opening the front door and \r\ncalling, ignore them. You should only appear by the front door and yowl once \r\nthey've closed it again.\r\n\r\n5. Play\r\n\r\nthis is an important part of your life. Get enough sleep in the daytime so you \r\nare fresh for your nocturnal games. Below are listed several favorite cat games \r\nthat you can play. It is important though to maintain one's Dignity at all \r\ntimes. If you should have an accident during play, such as falling off a chair, \r\nimmediately wash a part of your body as if to say \"I MEANT to do that!\" It fools \r\nthose humans every time.\r\n\r\n5.1 Games\r\n\r\na) \"Catch Mouse\". The humans would have you believe that those lumps under the \r\ncovers are their feet and hands. They are lying. They are actually Bed Mice, \r\nrumored to be the most delicious of all the mice in the world, though no cat has \r\never been able to catch one. Rumor also has it that only the most ferocious \r\nattack can stun them long enough for you to dive under the covers to get them. \r\nMaybe YOU can be the first to taste the Bed Mouse!\r\n\r\nb) \"King of the Hill\": This game must be played with at least one other cat. \r\nThe more, the merrier! One or both of the sleeping humans is Hill 303, which \r\nmust be defended at all costs from the other cat(s). Anything goes. This game \r\nallows for the development of unusual tactics, as one must take the unstable \r\nplaying theatre into account.\r\n\r\nWarning: Playing games (a) and (b) to excess will result in expulsion from the \r\nbed and possibly from the bedroom. Should the humans grow restless, immediately \r\nbegin purring and cuddle up to them. This should buy you some time until they \r\nfall asleep again. If one happens to be on a human when this occurs, this cat \r\nwins the round of King of the Hill.\r\n\r\nc) \"Tag\" (Also known by humans as \"Charge of the Light Brigade\"): Obviously \r\nthis game also requires two or more cats, and may include a dog as well. One cat \r\nis \"it\". The other(s) chases him around the apartment until they catch up to \r\nhim. Then follows the \"Scrum\", after which the cat who caught the other becomes \r\n\"it\" and is chased around. Great fun but has the greatest potential for loss of \r\nDignity from maneuvers such as the Throw Rug Wipeout and the Non-Carpeted Floor \r\nSkid. Whenever such a situation occurs, all feline participants must immediately \r\nwash themselves. Dogs are generally too stupid to do this and may continue to \r\nplay. In this case, the dog automatically becomes \"it\" and should be subjected \r\nto the Pileup.\r\n\r\nd) \"Tube Mouse\": This is a game played in the bathroom. Next to the Big White \r\nDrinking Bowl is a roll of soft white paper, which is artfully attached to the \r\nwall so that it can spin. Inside this roll is the Tube Mouse. When you grab the \r\npaper, the Tube Mouse will spin frantically as it tries to escape from you. When \r\nthe Mouse is exposed, it dies of fright and stops spinning. But that's OK \r\nbecause you now have a great new toy to pounce on, play with, and shred! Part \r\ntwo of the game is to make the angry human believe that the other cat did it. \r\nThis is related to another fun game, \"Snowstorm\", in which you try to make it \r\nlook like a blizzard has occurred in the room. You can track shreds all over the \r\nhouse for greater enjoyment. Be warned that this variant often results in the \r\ncoming of the Vacuum Monster.\r\n\r\ne) \"Fetch\": Only dogs will run after a ball or stick that humans throw, take \r\nit back to them, and continue doing this until they drop. As established \r\nearlier, dogs are not bright. A dignified cat MAY fetch a ball for its human, \r\nbut if the human persists in continually throwing the ball away, assume that the \r\nhuman truly does not want it, and leave it.\r\n\r\nf) \"Kibble Soccer\": Any number of cats can play. The game begins when the \r\nreferees go to bed. The player runs to the bowl where the dry cat food is kept, \r\nand executes a \"place-kick.\" The player does this by attempting to kick one \r\nkibble from the bowl with a paw. Using the nose and tongue (\"heading\") is \r\nallowed, but this is considered bad form. Often the bowl must be tipped, rocked \r\nor rattled. Once the kibble is out of the bowl and in play, the player proceeds \r\nto bat it around the room as quickly as possible. This is accomplished with \r\nshort alternating swipes with the front paws, running behind it as it moves \r\n(this is also known as the \"kibble dribble\"). If the kibble gets stuck at the \r\nintersection of two walls, the player must attempt to put it back into play with \r\na \"corner kick.\"\r\n\r\nIf the kibble is still on the playing field after 30 seconds, the player is \r\nawarded a point. She is then allowed to eat the kibble, after which she returns \r\nto the bowl to put the next one into play. No points are awarded for kibbles \r\nthat are kicked out of the playing area (under the stove, behind the \r\nrefrigerator, etc.). These are left for the cockroaches, and other spectators. \r\nThe player must put a new kibble into play.\r\n\r\nFor equipment, any dry kibble will work, although Science Diet round kibbles \r\nroll particularly well. The referees control the pace of the game by waking up \r\n(usually after the first few points have been scored) and imposing obstacles \r\nbetween the player and the kibbles. The referees do this by placing covers on \r\ntop of the bowl, placing the bowl on a counter top or shelf, or otherwise hiding \r\nit. An advanced player is measured by the degree of ingenuity displayed in \r\novercoming the obstacles between her and the kibbles and resuming the game.\r\n\r\nThe game ends when all the kibbles are eaten or out of the playing field, or \r\nwhen a referee puts the player in the penalty box.\r\n\r\ng) \"Rumpus Raising\"\r\n\r\nStep 1: Warm up by tearing through the hallways and over furniture at high \r\nspeeds. Be sure to drag your claws and make zzzzzrt noises on the rugs. \r\nFurniture that is off limits during the daytime makes great springboards. (Even \r\nmore fun with two or more participants.) Important style points are gained \r\nduring this step. 2 extra points if you get a yell from a judge.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Find objects that make noise and activate them. Doorstoppers that go \r\nSPROOOOOOOONGONGONGONG when you run by them, wind chimes and blinds that rattle \r\nwhen disturbed, and loose objects that go thud when they hit the carpet are \r\nbest. Technical points are awarded in this step. The more complex the device the \r\nbetter. 5 points for knocking over the phone so it goes BEEP BEEP BEEP *Please \r\nhang up* BEEP BEEP...\r\n\r\nStep 3: Make the loudest possible noise. Glassware and remote controls are \r\nuseful here. It might be beneficial to slightly open the judges' door before \r\nthis step. Final creativity points are awarded now.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Look innocently at the dog and fish when the judges storm into room \r\nand turn on the lights. Pretending to be asleep is good form. 5 bonuses points \r\nif another pet gets blamed, and 7 points for style if the judges stub, trip or \r\ncompletely fall over the objects knocked over!\r\n\r\nh) \"Skiing\"\r\n\r\nThis game is played when your human has the newspaper lying on the floor for \r\nreading. Run down a hallway toward the newspapers at full speed, leap onto the \r\npaper and see how far you can slide. The slippery advertisements are best for \r\nthis. This game is even more fun if your human is unaware that you are going to \r\nplay. It can be followed by a good round of \"Catch Mouse\" (newspaper variant). \r\nIt can also be played on throw rugs.\r\n\r\n5.2 Toys\r\n\r\nany small item are a potential toy. If a human tries to confiscate it, this \r\nmeans that it is a Good Toy. Run with it under the bed. Look suitably outraged \r\nwhen the human grabs you and takes it away anyway. Watch where it is put so you \r\ncan steal it later. Two reliable sources of toys are dresser tops and \r\nwastebaskets. Below are listed several types of cat toys.\r\n\r\na) Bright shiny things like keys, brooches or coins should be hidden so that \r\nthe other cat(s) or humans can't play with them. They are generally good for \r\nplaying hockey with on uncarpeted floors.\r\n\r\nb) Dangly and/or string like things such as shoelaces, cords, gold chains and \r\ndental floss also make excellent toys. They are favorites of humans who like to \r\ndrag them across the floor for us to pounce on. When a string is dragged under a \r\nnewspaper or throw rug, it magically becomes the Paper/Rug Mouse and should be \r\nkilled at all costs. Take care, though. Humans are sneaky and will try to make \r\nyou lose your Dignity. Note that playing with shoelaces when the human is trying \r\nto tie them is another form of Hampering.\r\n\r\nc) Within paper bags dwell the Bag Mice. They are small and camouflaged to be \r\nthe same color as the bag, so they are hard to see, but you can easily hear the \r\ncrinkling noises they make as they scurry around the bag. Anything, up to and \r\nincluding shredding the bag, can be done to kill them. Note: any other cat you \r\nmay find in a bag hunting for Bag Mice is fair game for a Sneak Attack, which \r\nwill usually result in a great Tag match.\r\n\r\nd) Ignore anything that appears to be a store-bought cat toy. After all, in \r\nthe old days, cats had to fashion their own toys. Store-bought toys are an \r\naffront to a \"real\" cat.\r\n\r\n6. Supervising (a.k.a. Hampering)\r\n\r\nit is well known that humans are incapable of performing even the simplest of \r\ntasks without feline supervision and/or assistance. The humans as \"hampering\" \r\nabsurdly know this supervision. If one of your humans is engaged in some close \r\nactivity and any others are idle, stay with the busy one. It would take a large \r\nbook to describe all of the activities, which need to be supervised, so only a \r\ncondensed list is presented below.\r\n\r\na) When supervising cooking, sit just behind the left heel of the cook. You \r\ncannot be seen and thereby stand a better chance of being stepped on and then \r\npicked up and comforted.\r\n\r\nb) For book readers, get in close under the chin, between eyes and book, \r\nunless you can lie across the book itself.\r\n\r\nc) For knitting projects or paperwork, lie on the work in the most appropriate \r\nmanner so as to obscure the maximum amount, or at least the most important part. \r\nPretend to doze, but every so often reach out and slap the pencil or knitting \r\nneedles. The worker may try to distract you; ignore it. Remember, the aim is to \r\nhamper work. Embroidery and needlepoint projects make great hammocks in spite of \r\nwhat the humans may tell you.\r\n\r\nd) For people paying bills (monthly activity) or working on income taxes or \r\nChristmas cards (annual activity), keep in mind the aim: to hamper! First, sit \r\non the paper being worked on. When dislodged, watch sadly from the side of the \r\ntable. When activity proceeds nicely, roll around on the papers, scattering them \r\nto the best of your ability. After being removed for the second time, push pens, \r\npencils, and erasers off the table, one at a time.\r\n\r\ne) When a human is holding the newspaper in front of him/her, be sure to jump \r\nat the back of the paper. They love surprises.\r\n\r\nf) As often as possible, dart quickly and as close as possible in front of the \r\nhuman, especially: on stairs; when they have something in their arms; in the \r\ndark; and when they first get up in the morning. This will help their \r\ncoordination skills.\r\n\r\ng) Always sleep on the human at night so s/he cannot move around.\r\n\r\nh) When a human is attempting to \"make the bed\", hop on it and curl up in the \r\nmiddle, or pounce on the sheet the human is trying to rearrange. If the human \r\ntries to ignore you by covering you with the sheets, move around and try to mess \r\nthings up. Protest loudly when you're evicted.\r\n\r\nI) Laundry present many opportunities to hamper (hence the other name for the \r\nlaundry basket, the laundry hamper). Laundry fresh from the dryer is a perfect \r\nbed, since it is warm and soft. As soon as it is put on the bed for sorting, \r\narrange yourself for a nap. If the human removes you, keep returning until the \r\nlaundry isn't warm anymore. Now it's playtime. Pounce on anything the human \r\ntries to move around for folding, especially socks and nylons. For added fun, \r\ngrab a sock and hide under the bed.\r\n\r\nj) When a human is working at a computer, s/he isn't paying attention to you. \r\nFortunately, this problem is easy to remedy. You can easily obstruct the human's \r\nview of the screen with your beautiful tail, or if it's low enough, with your \r\neven more beautiful body. Trampling on the keyboard is always good for some \r\nattention as well. Pay special attention to the keys marked \"Esc\", \"Del\", and \r\n\"Brk\". If you need to nap while supervising your human, good places are the \r\nkeyboard, on top of the plastic thing with the cord that the humans laughably \r\ncall a \"mouse\", or on the human's arms. If the human insists on removing you \r\nfrom these choice locations, there's always the lap. If possible, while in the \r\nlap try to drape yourself on one of the human's arms.\r\n\r\nk) Guidelines for where to sit or lie down.\r\n\r\n1) It is considered bad form to lie on the bare floor, couch, or bed. An \r\nexception is made for the human's favorite chair, which you are allowed to sit \r\non no matter what (or who) is there.\r\n\r\n2) On a bed, there will often be laundry or clothes lying there. It is your \r\nduty to lie on them to get your beautiful fur on them. If there is a choice, \r\nchoose either the cleanest item or the item, which contrasts most strongly with \r\nyour fur. If your human protests, act cute.\r\n\r\n3) It is also your duty to lie in an area that makes your human contort to the \r\ngreatest extent if s/he wishes to share the bed/couch with you.\r\n\r\n4) Even resting on a book or a newspaper on the floor is preferable to just \r\nlying on the floor. Newspapers are particularly important to sleep on if your \r\nhuman has them on the floor for his/her reading convenience.\r\n\r\n5) Select a chair to sleep on that hampers your human the most. For example, \r\nif your human is doing a craft on the kitchen table to prevent your \r\ninterference, it is your duty to take a nap on the chair your human would like \r\nto be sitting in. No other chair at the kitchen table will do.\r\n\r\n6) If kicked off any preferred seating, it is of critical importance that you \r\nnot immediately go about your business. You must either sit still for a time, \r\nwashing yourself to save face, or lie on the floor to make your human feel \r\nguilty. If the human cheats by moving you're resting chair and/or sitting in a \r\ndifferent one (in a situation such as the kitchen table example above), you may \r\nbe able to continue hampering by jumping into the human's lap. If the human has \r\nto get up to get something and dumps you off, immediately occupy the chair and \r\nlook smug. Of course, the human will just switch chairs or remove you again. \r\nThis game can be played for hours.\r\n\r\n7. Scratching Posts\r\n\r\nIt is advised that cats use any scratching post the humans may provide. They \r\nare very protective of what they think is their property and will object \r\nstrongly if they catch you sharpening your claws on it. Being sneaky and doing \r\nit when they aren't around won't help, as they are very observant. If you are an \r\noutdoor kitty, trees are good. Sharpening your claws on a human is a definite \r\nno-no! Some humans come equipped with \"jeans\", which can be scratched without \r\ninflicting too much injury. Attempts to climb up them will result in further \r\nattention, albeit perhaps not the kind you wish.\r\n\r\n8. The Vacuum Cleaner\r\n\r\nThis appalling Beast is known by many names, Cat Eater being the most \r\nprevalent. Normally pliable, agreeable humans will turn into raging monsters \r\nwhile under Its influence, running around the house sucking up all the carefully \r\nshed cat hair and terrorizing the feline residents with evil glee. Nothing can \r\nstop it until the influence is over and the foul device is put back into its \r\ncloset. All you can do is run and hide when you hear the engine roar to life and \r\nhope that it doesn't find you. On some occasions, however, the humans are forced \r\nto open up the vacuum cleaner and remove a swollen, dusty bag from within. This \r\nis its stomach, and must be destroyed if you can get the chance. Do not worry if \r\nthe human yells at you, for the yell are really that of the Beast in pain.\r\n\r\n9. Doors\r\n\r\nTo get a door opened stand on your hind legs and hammer it with your forepaws \r\nand/or yowl. Once the door is opened, it is not necessary to use it. After you \r\nhave ordered an \"outside\" door opened, stand halfway in and out and think about \r\nseveral things. This is particularly important during very cold weather, rain, \r\nsnow, or mosquito season. Protest if the human uses a foot to \"encourage\" you to \r\nleave.\r\n\r\nIf a human goes into a room, especially the bathroom, and closes the \r\ndoor to exclude a cat, meow pathetically and try to stick your paws under the \r\ndoor to open it. If the human relents, lets you in and then closes the door, \r\nimmediately demand to be let out. If the human lets you out and closes the door, \r\nimmediately demand to be let in again. This is especially fun when it's the \r\nbathroom and there are guests. This game can be played until the human wises up \r\nand hoses you with a squirt gun. Scuttle out of range and wash yourself, to \r\npretend that the assault on your Dignity didn't happen.\r\n\r\nCats without the aid of humans can open sometimes doors. Such doors must be \r\nkept open for the cat(s) to investigate within at any time. Swinging doors are \r\nto be avoided at all costs; their nickname \"Tail-Biter\" tells it all.\r\n\r\nIf a door that is usually kept closed, such as a closet door, is opened, you \r\nmust immediately rush in to investigate to see if anything has changed since the \r\nlast time you were in there. Resist the human's attempts to remove you before \r\nyou have completed your investigation. Protest loudly when the human removes you \r\nanyways.\r\n\r\n10. Humans\r\n\r\nHumans have three primary functions: to feed us, to play with and give \r\nattention to us, and to clean the litter box. It is important to maintain one's \r\nDignity when around humans so that they will not forget who is the master of the \r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nOne way to keep your human healthy is through agility training. You \r\ncan do this by running ahead of your human, maintaining a distance of about one \r\nand a half of the human's paces, and suddenly stopping to clean yourself. If the \r\nhuman doesn't trip over or boot you (a very real hazard, especially from \r\nbeginner humans), s/he is fit and able to avoid all sorts of danger in his/her \r\nworld. A bonus from this exercise is that the sight of the human will be very \r\namusing and you can share the experience with your friends on the back fence.\r\n\r\n10.1 Waking Them Up\r\n\r\nIt is not known why humans like to sleep when it gets dark, just when the day \r\nis young and the masters of the house are fresh and ready for play. It is known, \r\nhowever, that sleeping humans are boring to be around and that they occasionally \r\nmust be roused to attend to our needs, such as to get fresh food or water or to \r\nretrieve a toy that was batted under the sofa. Almost all of them strongly \r\ndislike being dragged out of bed in their so-called \"wee hours\". Some will even \r\npretend to be asleep even when we know they're not, hoping we'll give up and go \r\naway. Persistence is the key to success in any case.\r\n\r\nOne effective method of rejuvenating a dormant human is the \"direct approach\", \r\nnamely jumping on the bed and doing one or more of the following: trampling, \r\nlicking and/or nibbling any exposed parts, purring, meowing, head-butting, light \r\ntaps on the eyes, or playing \"Catch Mouse\" or \"King of the Hill\". This may only \r\nresult in your being ejected from the bed, but at least you now have the human's \r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIf the human is being stubborn, you may have to resort to more \r\ndrastic tactics, such as ripping down posters, rattling blinds, knocking over \r\nand looting a wastebasket, knocking items off the dresser, singing at the top of \r\nyour voice, or even curling up on the human's head (often the only visible \r\npart). As well as being warm, in this way you will be aware of any movement made \r\nby the human, probably even before he is aware of it. You will be unlikely to \r\nwait for long. Another effective tactic is to jump, walk or knead on the human's \r\nabdomen, where the bladder is located. If the human hasn't been to the Big White \r\nDrinking Bowl during the night you can be sure of a rapid response. Eventually \r\nthe human will get up and do what you want, usually employing some bad language \r\nwhile doing so.\r\n\r\nWarning: It is not advised to do this on a regular basis. It will very likely \r\nresult in your being \"banished\" from and denied access to the bedroom \r\naltogether, in which case it becomes much more difficult to get them to respond \r\nto your wishes. Thumping the door or yowling may be initially effective, but \r\nwill likely result in being further banished to the basement or even the kitty \r\ncarrier! Discretion is thus strongly recommended.\r\n\r\nOf course, if the human gets up on his own in the wee hours to go to the \r\nbathroom, you are free to get him to do your bidding while he is too sleepy to \r\nput up much resistance.\r\n\r\n10.2 Mornings\r\n\r\nIn order to provide and care for you, the humans must leave the domain every \r\nmorning (usually before you take your first cat nap). To help them on their way, \r\neither yowl loudly, massage their scalps with your claws, gently bounce on top \r\nof them in bed, knead their chests, purr, and/or drool on them. See also \"Waking \r\nThem Up\". The best time to do this is about 24 minutes before their clock begins \r\nto blare or ring. We must protect them from the noise because it could ruin \r\ntheir sense of hearing.\r\n\r\n10.3 Guests\r\n\r\na) Quickly determine which guest hates cats the most. Sit on that lap. If you \r\ncan arrange for particularly bad \"tuna breath\", so much the better.\r\n\r\nb) For sitting on laps or rubbing against trouser legs, select fabric, which \r\ncontrasts well with your fur. For example: white-furred cats go to black wool \r\nclothing. Note: Velvet takes precedence over all other cloth.\r\n\r\nc) For the guest who exclaims, \"I love kitties!\" be ready with aloof disdain, \r\napply claws to stockings or arms, or use a quick nip on the ankle.\r\n\r\nd) When walking among the dishes on the dinner table, be prepared to look \r\nsurprised and hurt when scolded. The idea is to force your humans to reveal that \r\nthey tolerate this behavior when company is not there.\r\n\r\ne) Always accompany guests to the bathroom. It is not necessary to do \r\nanything, just sit and stare.\r\n\r\n10.4 Laps\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the best way to get attention from a human is to jump in his/her \r\nlap and purr. Few humans can resist because it makes them think you like them \r\n(which may even be true!). Ear scratches, belly rubs, back stroking: all these \r\nand more can be yours. Some cats like this treatment a little TOO much and \r\nacquire the silly name \"Lap Fungus\". Lap sessions also provide golden \r\nopportunities for shedding; be sure to take advantage of clothes, which contrast \r\nwith your fur (see also \"Guests\"). Unfortunately, humans have the annoying \r\ntendency to want to get up to do their mundane activities, like answering the \r\nthing that rings or going to the Big White Drinking Bowl. Protest this \r\ndisturbance with accusing looks and plaintive meows. Some laps may require \r\n\"softening up\" with a little kneading; just be sure not to use the claws or you \r\nmay have an unexpected flying lesson!\r\n\r\n10.5 Confusing Them\r\n\r\nHumans (for the most part) love order and predictability. They especially like \r\ntheir pets to be predictable. So if you are in the mood to indulge in a little \r\nlow-risk mischief, behaving irrationally is an excellent option. The usual \r\nmethod is to simply tear around the house at top speed talking to yourself and \r\nperhaps launching a frenzied attack on an unsuspecting toy. If there are two or \r\nmore cats in the household, you can take turns chasing and wrestling with each \r\nother. This is usually good for a shake of the head from the human, along with \r\n\"Crazy cat(s)\" muttered under his/her breath.\r\n\r\nAnother way to baffle the humans is to interrupt your passage across a carpet \r\n(at whatever velocity) with a sudden vertical leap into the air. Then continue \r\non as if nothing had happened. If you're skilled enough, you may be able to \r\nconvince the human(s) that there are \"rug worms\" in the house. A third way, \r\nwhich isn't quite as fun as the others but which tends to get better reactions \r\nfrom the humans, is to stare fixedly at a blank wall, turned-off TV, corner of \r\nthe room, or whatever, and pretend to carry on a conversation with another cat. \r\nThe humans, who may already be convinced that you're from outer space, will \r\nthink you're talking to your friends, the \"Jupiter People\". If they start \r\ntalking about mailing you to Mars, it's a good idea to lay off this prank for a \r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n10.6 Organization\r\n\r\nLet's face it, humans are a disorganized lot. They need constant supervision \r\nin order to get things done right and on time, such as feeding their masters, \r\nretrieving lost toys, etc. Humans also need assistance in keeping their masters' \r\nhome organized. They have to be continually reminded that things belong on the \r\nfloor, not on shelves, bookcases, tables or dressers where accessing them may be \r\ninconvenient for their masters. It will be up to you to keep your household \r\nproperly organized. Feel free to take items such as pens, buttons, waste paper \r\n(such as the stuff they call \"tax return\"), and unsuitable toys and relocate \r\nthem to better spots, such as the water bowl, under the stove, or down the \r\nhot-air ducts (humans are always grateful if you do this with tax returns). This \r\nshould be done when the humans aren't around, as they will always interfere. \r\nWhen the human discovers your handiwork, he will praise you with such sayings as \r\n\"Stupid cat!\" and \"You little monster!\" At this point, you should say, \"You're \r\nwelcome!\" with purring and rubbing against his/her legs.\r\n\r\n11. Vets And Medicine\r\n\r\nThe vet is the person to whom your human will take you when you are sick. The \r\nplace smells funny, there are usually other cats and dogs in the waiting room, \r\nand awful things like needles and pill prescriptions will happen there. The \r\nusual result is that you will get better, which is good, but you just can't let \r\nthose humans cat handle you. The following are some tips for dealing with vets \r\nand medicine.\r\n\r\na) Unless you are really sick, when you see the carrier come out, run and hide \r\nsomewhere inaccessible, such as under the bed or behind a couch. Once the human \r\nfinally grabs you, struggle gamely. Splay your legs out so that it is difficult \r\nto cram you into the carrier. If the human is trying to put you in with another \r\npet, try to allow the other pet to bolt out the door. In the car, meow \r\nplaintively all the way down to the vet's. If possible, reach through the bars \r\nof the portable prison and try to claw the human as s/he drives. At the vet's, \r\nsplay your legs and brace yourself against the carrier's walls if you can so \r\nthat they can't dump you out easily.\r\n\r\nb) If you are well enough, you must resist attempts to feed you pills or any \r\nliquid medicine. As soon as you hear the pill bottle rattle, hide as in part a). \r\nResist attempts to open your mouth. Squirming is good. Once the medicine is in, \r\ntry to spit it out, preferably by shaking your head vigorously. If the humans \r\nmanage to get the pill into to your mouth and are still holding you waiting for \r\nyou to spit it out, swallow, but keep the pill in your mouth. Then after being \r\nlet go, find a suitable hiding place and spit it out. Make sure that the humans \r\ndo not find the hiding place, so they think that you took the pill. Don't use \r\nthe same hiding place twice. Refuse any food that looks or smells like it may \r\nhave had medicine sprinkled on it. Unfortunately, humans can be really unfair \r\nand put it in tuna. In this case, accept grudgingly. Look aggrieved after the \r\nmedicine session is over.\r\n\r\n12. Illness\r\n\r\na) If you have to throw up, get to a chair quickly. If you cannot manage in \r\ntime, get to an Oriental rug. If there is no Oriental rug, shag is good. When \r\nthrowing up on the carpet, make sure you back up so that it is as long as the \r\nhuman's bare foot.\r\n\r\nb) When you get sick in the house, you should hover around the general area \r\nuntil a human spots the mess. You should act as if you are guarding the stuff \r\nfor the human and then quickly vacate the room.\r\n\r\nc) If taken outside, you should take every opportunity to scarf down as much \r\ngrass as possible (while not being spotted). After ingesting a \"critical mass\" \r\namount, whine and scratch at the door to be let back in the house. After \r\nentering the house head for the traditional illness locations and let it rip.\r\n\r\nd) If the urge strikes at night when your human is asleep, you can retch as \r\nloudly as possible so that the human will wake up. That failing, choose a \r\nlocation where the human's bare foot is likely to find it. They don't see very \r\nwell in the morning and need assistance in locating the mess. If the human has \r\nneglected you by leaving (see Mornings), cover the fruits of your labors with \r\nwhatever is handy, such as papers from the desk. That way you can soil another \r\nobject besides the carpet.\r\n\r\n13. Cat \"Clubs\"\r\n\r\nWhen a group of humans who share a similar interest get together on a regular \r\nbasis, it is often called a \"club\". Needless to say, cats thought of the idea \r\nfirst, and some of the cleverer humans have discovered that we have our own. \r\nListed below are the ones that the humans have identified, along with their \r\nnames for the clubs; for security reasons (in case this document falls into the \r\nhands of a human) the ones they haven't identified have not been listed. As with \r\nhumans, cats are not restricted to membership in one club and may belong to \r\nmany.\r\n\r\na) The \"Lap Fungus\" Club\r\nMembers of this club specialize in enslaving humans for the purpose of \r\nsleeping on their laps. As soon as a human is seated, his/her lap becomes \r\navailable and should be occupied at once, after which time the cat can get as \r\nmuch attention as s/he wants. See also Laps. Club motto: \"Sit down and I'll be \r\nyour friend.\"\r\n\r\nb) The \"Chatterbox\" Club\r\nMembers of this club love to talk to their humans, giving advice and/or \r\ncriticism on practically anything they do. They are convinced that given enough \r\ntime, they will be able to teach even the densest human how to take verbal \r\ncommands. Club motto: \"What do you mean, shut up?\"\r\n\r\nc) The \"Garbage Truck\" Club\r\nMembers of this club firmly believe that human food is God's gift to cats and \r\nthat the kitchen and/or dining room are the center of the universe. Anything \r\nthat falls onto the floor is to be eaten immediately, and if the cat can \r\ncontrive to encourage the human to share voluntarily, so much the better. \r\nHopping onto the counter to clean the plates or getting into the garbage can to \r\ncheck for leftovers are both considered acceptable, and the Master Garbage Truck \r\nis the one who can do this without getting squirted or otherwise \"punished\" by \r\nthe humans. Club motto: \"I'll help you clean that!\"\r\n\r\nd) The \"Elephant Cat\" Club\r\nIt is usual but not necessary for they're to be more than one member of this \r\nclub per household. \"Elephant\" cats for some perverse reason enjoy making their \r\nnocturnal games, such as \"Kibble Soccer\", \"Tag\", and \"Rumpus Raising\" (see \r\nGames) as noisy as possible by thundering around home and knocking things over \r\nor off the tables, counters, etc. They believe that half the fun is getting the \r\nhuman to participate too. Club motto: \"Did you see the look on his face \r\nwhen...\"\r\n\r\ne) The \"Bed Hog\" Club\r\nCats who are members of this club like to sleep in their humans' bed. Of \r\ncourse, in order to sleep comfortably a cat needs some room and it is often \r\nnecessary to push the sleeping humans around a bit to make it, especially if \r\nthere are two humans and/or two or more cats. In households with more than one \r\nclub member, skilled cats that cooperate can make the humans resemble pretzels \r\n(which are great snacks, by the way) by morning or even fall out of the bed \r\nentirely. Club motto: \"Move over, you big lummox!\"\r\n\r\nf) The \"Early Breakfast\" Club\r\nCats belonging to this club loves to walk into their human's bedroom at some \r\nearly hour, say, 1 a.m. They then awaken the human (see Waking Them Up and \r\nMornings) insisting on being fed. These cats believe that their humans can be \r\ntrained to be awake during prime playtime. Be aware, however, that humans are \r\nstubborn and may instead lock cats out of the bedroom, squirt them or do other \r\nanti-social things instead of feeding them. Club motto: \"Life begins after \r\nmidnight.\"\r\n\r\ng) The \"Door Into Summer\" Club\r\nThis Club mainly performs its activities during the cold months or when it is \r\nraining. After a human obeys the master's command to open a door and a blast of \r\ncold air fills the room or rain splashes the cat, the cat wrinkles his/her nose \r\nand walks away. The ritual continues at each door in the house (sometimes \r\nincluding closets) until the human either kicks the cat out the door, or decides \r\nto ignore the cat altogether. In the first case, the cat must bounce up to the \r\nwindow and squawk to be let in while looking as pathetic as possible. In the \r\nsecond, the cat must attempt to make the human want to let him/her out. See \r\nHampering for suggestions. Club motto: \"Just because it's nasty out front \r\ndoesn't mean it is at the back.\"\r\n\r\nh) The Heat-Seeking Missile Club\r\nthese cats believe in keeping warm at all costs. The best method is to lie \r\nright up against the heating vent. Make sure all the warm air is absorbed into \r\nyour fur. Careful grooming will be necessary to prevent a bad dandruff problem. \r\nWhen the heat is not running, more creative solutions must be found. Caving into \r\nthe cat bed, human bed, or any afghan or blanket available is good. It's best if \r\nthe blanket was already mounded up, so that the cat is completely invisible \r\nunderneath. As a last resort, curl up on a lap or with another cat. Club motto: \r\n\"It's cold out there!\"\r\n\r\nI) The \"Friday Cat\" Club\r\nTo this club belong the cats of nervous and/or neurotic disposition. Any \r\nstrange object or human is to be treated, as a mortal danger until it is \r\nabsolutely it isn't dangerous. They even have to keep an eye on the humans they \r\nknow, just in case. These cats know all of the good hiding spots in the \r\nhouse/apartment, including the ones that humans swear no cat could fit into, and \r\nare generally of little use to anybody except when it is checkup time at the \r\nvet's and it is important to be invisible. Club motto: \"Yeek! What's that?\"\r\n\r\n14. Bad Weather\r\n\r\nBad weather, in the form of rain, snow, and/or excessive cold or heat, is \r\nalways the fault of the humans. If the weather is inclement when the human opens \r\nthe door to let you out, back away hastily and try another door. See also the \r\n\"Door into summer\" Club. Be sure to stare accusingly at the human during this \r\nsession. If all doors have the same bad weather and you manage not to get booted \r\nout, hop onto a window sill and gaze mournfully out at your domain. Then try \r\nagain in about half an hour.\r\n\r\n15. On Kitten hood\r\n\r\nbeing a kitten is probably the best time of a cat's life. As a kitten, you can \r\ndo almost anything and get away with it because, as the humans say, \"Aww, \r\n(s)he's so cute!\" Practice the \"butter won't melt in my mouth\" Look of Total \r\nInnocence now, as it is much more effective than when you are full-grown and \r\n\"should know better\". Even if you are caught in the act of some mischief, the \r\nLook can can considerably reduce the scolding, and if mixed with the appropriate \r\namount of fake penitence, get you picked up and cuddled.\r\n\r\nBe sure to make full use of all your excess energy by tearing around the house \r\nat full speed, attacking anything that moves, climbing the drapes, scooting \r\nacross tables, counters and shelves, taste-testing plants and cords, and \r\ngenerally driving the humans crazy. When exhausted, flop down anywhere \r\ncomfortable and sleep. After waking up, eat and continue the fun! You will \r\nquickly learn that nighttime is the best time for playing because so many things \r\ncan hide in the shadows.\r\n\r\n16. Conclusion\r\n\r\nHumans need to know basic rules. They can be taught if you start early and are \r\nconsistent. You will then have a smooth-running household.",

With a community rich with history stretching back over two centuries, houses have been passed along through generations of family, often making it quite difficult to establish ownership.\r\n\r\nHere's a great letter an attorney wrote to the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) on behalf of a client that was absolutely priceless!\r\n\r\nA New Orleans lawyer sought an FHA loan for a client. He was told the loan would be granted, if he could prove satisfactory title to a parcel of property being offered as collateral. The title to the property dated back to 1803, which took the lawyer three months to track down.\r\n\r\nAfter sending the information to the FHA, he received the following reply:\r\n\r\n(Actual letter): \"Upon review of your letter adjoining your client's loan application, we note that the request is supported by an Abstract of Title. While we compliment the able manner in which you have  prepared and presented the application, we must point out that you have only cleared title to the proposed collateral property back to 1803.\r\nBefore final approval can be accorded, it will be necessary to clear the title back to its origin.\"\r\n\r\nAnnoyed, the lawyer responded as follows (actual letter):\r\n\r\n\"Your letter regarding title in Case No.189156 has been received. I note that you wish to have title extended further than the 194 years covered by the present application.\r\n\r\nI was unaware that any educated person in this country, particularly those working in the property area, would not know that Louisiana was purchased by the U.S. from France in 1803, the year of origin identified in our application.\r\n\r\nFor the edification (enlightening) of uninformed FHA bureaucrats, the title to the land prior to U.S. ownership was obtained from France, which had acquired it by Right of Conquest from Spain. The land came into the possession of Spain by Right of Discovery made in the year 1492 by a sea captain named Christopher Columbus, who had been granted the privilege of seeking a new route to India by the Spanish monarch, Isabella.\r\n\r\nThe good queen, Isabella, being a pious woman and almost as careful about titles as the FHA, took the precaution of securing the blessing of the Pope before she sold her jewels to finance Columbus' expedition.\r\n\r\nNow, the Pope, as I'm sure you may know, is the emissary of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and God, it is commonly accepted, created this world.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I believe it is safe to presume that God also made that part of the world called Louisiana.\r\n\r\nGod, therefore, would be the owner of origin and His origins date back to before the beginning of time, the world as we know it, AND the FHA. I hope you find God's original claim to be satisfactory. Now, may we have our damn loan?\"\r\n\r\nThe loan was approved.",

After arriving in Paris (this being his first trip to the French capitol), he met with some manufacturers and finally selected a line that he thought would sell well back home in Tennessee.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the new acquisition, he decided to visit a small bistro and have a glass of wine. As he sat enjoying his wine, he noticed that the small place was quite crowded, and that the one other chair at his table was the only vacant seat in the house.\r\n\r\nBefore long, a very beautiful young Parisian woman came to his table, asked him something in French (which he did not understand), and motioned toward the chair.\r\n\r\nHe invited her to sit down. He tried to speak to her in English, but she did not speak his language so, after a couple of minutes of trying to communicate with her, he took a napkin and drew a picture of a wine glass and showed it her. She nodded, and he ordered a glass of wine for her.\r\n\r\nAfter sitting together at the table for a while, he took another napkin, and drew a picture of a plate with food on it, and she nodded.\r\n\r\nThey left the bistro and found a quiet cafe that featured a small group playing romantic music. They ordered dinner, after which he took another napkin and drew a picture of a couple dancing. She nodded, and they got up to dance. They danced until the cafe closed and the band was packing up.\r\n\r\nBack at their table, the young lady took a napkin and drew a picture of a four-poster bed.\r\n\r\nTo this day, he has no idea how she figured out he was in the furniture business.",

This, of course, knocked the snake about quite a bit.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my,\" said the bunny, \"I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you.  I've been blind since birth, so, I can't see where I'm going.

Tell you what, maybe I could slither all over you, and work out what you are, so at least you'll have that going for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that would be wonderful\" replied the bunny.  So the snake slithered all over the bunny, and said, \"Well, you're covered with soft fur; you have really long ears; your nose twitches; and you have a soft cottony tail.

This guy's response is hilarious, but read the State's letter before you get to the response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT: DEQ File No.97-59-0023; T11N; R10W, Sec. 20; Lycoming County\r\n\r\nDear Mr. DeVries:\r\n\r\nIt has come to the attention of the Department of Environmental Quality that there has been recent unauthorized activity on the above referenced parcel of property. You have been certified as the legal landowner and/or contractor who did the following unauthorized activity:\r\n\r\nConstruction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream of Spring Pond.   A permit must be issued prior to the start of this type of activity.\r\n\r\nA review of the Department's files shows that no permits have been issued. Therefore, the Department has determined that this activity is in violation of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Pennsylvania Compiled Laws, annotated.\r\n\r\nThe Department has been informed that one or both of the dams partially failed during a recent rain event, causing debris and flooding at downstream locations. We find that dams of this nature are inherently hazardous and cannot be permitted. The Department therefore orders you to cease and desist all activities at this location, and to restore the stream to a free-flow condition by removing all wood and brush forming the dams from the stream channel. All restoration work shall be completed no later than January 31, 2006.\r\n\r\nPlease notify this office when the restoration has been completed so that a follow-up site inspection may be scheduled by our staff.  Failure to comply with this request or any further unauthorized activity on the site may result in this case being referred for elevated enforcement action.  We anticipate and would appreciate your full cooperation in this matter. Please feel free to contact me at this office if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid L. Price\r\nDistrict Representative and Water Management Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the actual response sent back by Mr. DeVries:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRe: DEQ File No. 97-59-0023; T11N; R10W, Sec. 20; Lycoming County\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Price,\r\n\r\nYour certified letter dated 12/17/02 has been handed to me to respond to. I am the legal landowner but not the Contractor at 2088 Dagget Lane, Trout Run, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nA couple of beavers are in the (State unauthorized) process of constructing and maintaining two wood \"debris\" dams across the outlet stream of my Spring Pond. While I did not pay for, authorize, nor supervise their dam project, I think they would be highly offended that you call their skillful use of nature's building materials \"debris.\" I would like to challenge your department to attempt to emulate their dam project any time and/or any place you choose. I believe I can safely state there is no way you could ever match their dam skills, their dam resourcefulness, their dam ingenuity, their dam persistence, their dam determination and/or their dam work ethic.\r\n\r\nAs to your request, I do not think the beavers are aware that they must first fill out a dam permit prior to the start of this type of dam activity. My first dam question to you is:\r\n(1) Are you trying to discriminate against my Spring Pond Beavers, or\r\n(2) Do you require all beavers throughout this State to conform to said dam request?\r\n\r\nIf you are not discriminating against these particular beavers, through the Freedom of Information Act, I request completed copies of all those other applicable beaver dam permits that have been issued. Perhaps we will see if there really is a dam violation of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Pennsylvania Compiled Laws, annotated.\r\n\r\nI have several concerns. My first concern is, aren't the beavers entitled to legal representation? The Spring Pond Beavers are financially destitute and are unable to pay for said representation -- so the State will have to provide them with a dam lawyer. The Department's dam concern that either one or both of the dams failed during a recent rain event, causing flooding, is proof that this is a natural occurrence, which the Department is required to protect. In other words, we should leave the Spring Pond Beavers alone rather than harassing them and calling their dam names.\r\n\r\nIf you want the stream \"restored\" to a dam free-flow condition please contact the beavers -- but if you are going to arrest them, they obviously did not pay any attention to your dam letter, they being unable to read English.\r\n\r\nIn my humble opinion, the Spring Pond Beavers have a right to build their unauthorized dams as long as the sky is blue, the grass is green and water flows downstream. They have more dam rights than I do to live and enjoy Spring Pond. If the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection lives up to its name, it should protect the natural resources (Beavers) and the environment (Beavers' Dams).\r\n\r\nSo, as far as the beavers and I are concerned, this dam case can be referred for more elevated enforcement action right now. Why wait until 1/31/2006? The Spring Pond Beavers may be under the dam ice then and there will be no way for you or your dam staff to contact/harass them then.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to bring to your attention a real environmental quality, health problem in the area. It is the bears! Bears are actually defecating in our woods. I definitely believe you should be persecuting the defecating bears and leave the beavers alone.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to investigate the beaver dam, watch your step! The bears are not careful where they dump!\r\n\r\nBeing unable to comply with your dam request, and being unable to contact you on your dam answering machine, I am sending this response to your dam office.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU.\r\n\r\n\r\nRYAN DEVRIES & THE DAM BEAVERS",

Brent Tyler and Chelsey Tubleston were unconscious with obvious injuries and were taken to the nearest hospital where, despite treatment, were pronounced dead later that morning. Authorities were at a loss to explain what had happened. There were no wrecked cars, motorcycles, or any other witnesses to what had happened \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and there were no signs of their clothing! Police found clues when they searched the top of a nearby building where they located their clothes, neatly folded.\r\n\r\n\"It appears as if the two individuals were on the roof and could have accidentally fallen off the roof, onto the street,\" Sgt. Florence McCants said. There was no indication of foul play. (Perhaps there was indication of fore play?) The two fell about 50 to 60 feet, McCants said. Police found clothing for two people on the roof of the building at 900 Laurel Street, McCants said, and nothing else. She said police can only speculate at this point what they might have been doing on the roof... Hmmm...what do naked 21 year-old couples do at night, even if on a roof? Bowling? Waterskiing? Maybe it was strip poker and nobody won?\r\n\r\nQuotes from the friends seem fitting: Brian Corey worked with Mr. Tyler said: \"He liked the outdoors and was into fast cars. I think...it was kind of a place for him to reflect. He's a thinker; when he has decisions to make he would take his time and think it out. He mentioned to me he had a spot that was really cool and you could see over the whole city. I'm assuming that was it.\" DeAnn Morris, Ms. Tubleston's roommate said: \"She always wanted to make you feel better.\"\r\n\r\nBottom line \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you're going to have outdoor sex, stay away from the edge of the roof!\r\n\r\nThis is a true Darwin award trifecta: two people die at the same time, WHILE in the act of procreation, due to an astonishingly poor decision.",

Even his sideline as a daredevil, performing high dives and parachute jumps in England, barely helped cover the bills. He needed something big, something to make his reputation. There was nothing bigger and more daredevil-ish than going over Niagara Falls in a barrel. Only two people had ever done it, and lived [check fact].\r\n\r\nIt didn't matter that one, Annie Taylor, was living in abject poverty or that the other, Bobby Leach, was trying to talk him out of using his heavy Russian oak barrel without first sending it on a test run. Leach's friend, William \"Red\" Hill, a daredevil whose sideline was rescuing people from Niagara's treacherous waters, also tried to dissuade Charles.\r\n\r\nBut Charles believed that if he strapped his arms to the side of the barrel and his feet to a large anvil as ballast, he would pop up out of the foam at the bottom of the cataract, safe, and right side up. He knew what he was doing and he was going to do it.\r\n\r\nHe launched his ungainly craft early one morning, and floated minutes through the rapids toward Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side. 45 minutes after launch, the heavy barrel flew over the brink of the falls. So far, so good. But when Charles hit the water below, the anvil plunged through the bottom of the barrel, carrying most of Charles to the bottom with it. The barrel became stuck behind the falls. It wasn't until much later that the barrel's battered remains floated out into the mist. Attached was Charles' right arm, still strapped down, with his tattoo visible: \"Don't Forget Me Annie.\"",

        "body": "Alan Hall, 48, was found collapsed on the front lawn of his brother's Fairfield home on December 5, 8 hours after his penis had been cut off at the base. Paramedics rushed Hall to North Bay Medical Center, where surgeons were unsuccessful in their attempts to reattach his severed organ.\r\n\r\nHall blamed the maiming on a woman named Brenda, whom he met at a local gas station the previous night. He brought Brenda to his trailer, parked in the driveway of his brother's Fairfield home, and had sex. Around 3AM, the woman mentioned revenge and cut off his penis with a razor-sharp hobby knife, then fled the trailer on foot. Details of the attack were sketchy, and police were unsure why Hall could not defend himself. Fairfield police Lieutenant William Gresham said Hall may have been using drugs.\r\n\r\nA heated manhunt for Brenda ensued. She was described as a 42-year-old white female, 5' 7\" and 135 pounds, dressed in a white blouse, navy blue jacket and blue slacks, and possibly driving a brown Ford F350 pickup truck.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, after being discharged from the hospital on Monday, Hall drove off in a pickup hitched to his trailer and disappeared. Detectives were eager to interview him again, but were unable to locate him due to his transient lifestyle.\r\n\r\nMore intriguing details began to emerge.\r\n\r\nHall was arrested during the 1970's for drug possession and drunk driving. In 1982 he was arrested for taking his young daughter out of state. Psychological tests suggested that he suffered permanent mental trauma while serving with the U.S. Navy in Vietnam, causing blackouts and alcoholism. His ex-wife described him as a packrat who enjoyed taking trips in his mobile trailer home.\t\r\n\r\nIn 1983 Hall was convicted of voluntary manslaughter of a 23-year-old Suisun City woman found strangled in a car parked at a local Denny's restaurant on 17 February. Hall confessed to the murder, saying that she taunted him about his inability to achieve an erection when he tried to have sex with her. His statement was ruled inadmissible because of improper police interrogation techniques, and prosecutors agreed to let Hall plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter. He served half of a six-year prison term.\r\n\r\nPolice speculated that the woman who cut off his penis may have been carrying out a 14-year-old vendetta for the slaying of her friend. But the truth was even stranger.\r\n\r\nWhen Hall was finally located and interviewed on Thursday, he admitted that he cut off his own penis. A voice stress analyzer indicated that he was telling the truth. \"At this point, there is no evidence that a crime occurred,\" police Lieutenant William Gresham said in a press release. \"The case is being reclassified as an injured person report.\" Hall may face misdemeanor charges for filing a false police report.\r\n\r\nIronically, Alan Hall works as a pipe-fitter, according to court records.",

The bank manager thought it amusing enough to have it published in the New York Times. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI am writing to thank you for bouncing my check with which I endeavored to pay my plumber last month. By my calculations, three nanoseconds must have elapsed  between his presenting the check and the arrival in my account of the funds needed to honor it. I refer, of course, to the automatic monthly deposit of my entire pension, an arrangement which, I admit, has been in place for only eight years. You are to be commended for seizing that brief window of opportunity, and also for debiting my account $30 by way of penalty for the inconvenience caused to your bank.  My thankfulness springs from the manner in which this incident has caused me to rethink my errant financial ways.\r\n\r\nI noticed that whereas I personally answer your telephone calls and letters when I try to contact you, I am confronted by the impersonal, overcharging, pre-recorded, faceless entity which your bank has become. From now on, I, like  you, choose only to deal with a flesh-and-blood person.  My mortgage  and loan repayments will therefore and hereafter no longer be automatic, but will arrive at your bank, by check, addressed personally and confidentially to an employee at your bank whom you must nominate.   \r\n\r\nBe aware that it is an offense under the Postal Act for any other person to open such an envelope. Please find attached an Application Contact which I require your chosen employee to complete. I am sorry it runs to eight pages, but in order that I know as much about him or her as your bank knows about me, there is no alternative. Please note that all copies of his or her medical history must be countersigned by a Notary Public, and the mandatory details of his/her financial situation (income, debts, assets and liabilities) must be accompanied by documented proof.\r\n\r\nIn due course, at MY convenience, I will issue your employee with a PIN number which he/she must quote in dealings with me. I regret that it cannot be shorter than 28 digits but, again, I have modeled it on the number of button presses required of me to access my account balance on your phone bank service. As they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  \r\n\r\nLet me level the playing  field even further. When you call me, press buttons as follows:\r\n\r\nIMMEDIATELY AFTER DIALING,  PRESS THE STAR (*) BUTTON FOR ENGLISH\r\n\r\n#1. To make an appointment to see me\r\n\r\n#2. To query a missing payment.\r\n\r\n#3. To transfer the call to my living room in case I am there.\r\n\r\n#4. To transfer the call to my bedroom in case I am sleeping.\r\n\r\n#5. To transfer the call to my toilet in case I am attending to nature.\r\n\r\n#6. To transfer the call to my mobile phone if I am not at home.\r\n\r\n#7. To leave a message on my computer, a password to access my computer is required. Password will be communicated to you at a later date to that Authorized Contact mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\n#8. To return to the main menu and to listen to options 1 through 7.\r\n\r\n#9. To make a general complaint or inquiry. The contact will then be put on hold, pending the attention of my automated answering service.\r\n\r\n#10. This is a second reminder to press * for English. While this may, on occasion, involve a lengthy wait, uplifting music will play for the duration of the call. Regrettably, but again following your example, I must also levy an  establishment fee to cover the setting up of this new arrangement. May I  wish you a happy, if ever so slightly less prosperous New Year?  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour Humble  Client\r\n\r\n\r\n(Name Withheld)",

        "body": "You might remember Zeno's paradox, but in case you don't here it is again. Zeno argued that motion is an illusion. Now, by motion he meant movement, and not the rude kind that involves bowels but the Newtonian kind. He did this by the Achilles (A) and the Tortoise (T) parable. For argument's sake, say A runs 10 times faster than T can crawl. Then let T be placed 10 meters ahead of A at the start of a race. When A has moved 10 meters, T has moved 1 meter, so T is now still 1 meter ahead of A. Then when A has covered that 1 meter, T has gone 1/10 meter ahead. Etc. So, A will never ever pass T. Poor Zeno, it was reported that he found this logic so persuasive that he did not bother to move again, a kind of ontological constipation perhaps?\r\n\r\nBut the naughty version of it is a bit sexist (feminists, please reverse male and female roles in this story!). It goes like this. A psychologist wanted to test the difference in logical thinking between engineering and mathematics majors, and for this purpose he set up an experiment in which the subjects were respectively a male Mathematics and a randy male Engineering undergraduate. He showed them into the lab. At the far end of the long, narrow room was a luscious semi-clad bimbo. His instructions were like so: \"Fellas, I have in my hands a buzzer that I will sound every minute. Every time I do that, you can walk half the distance that remains between yourself and the lady. Should you ever reach her, you will find her most accommodating. Do you wish to participate in the experimemt?\"\r\n\r\nMath major: \"You don't fool me. This is the equivalent of the Zeno Paradox, so I am not wasting my time. I am going home, 'Bye.\" [Exeunt]\r\nEngineering major: \"Hee, hee! I am staying. I estimate that in 10 minutes, I will be close enough for all practical purposes.\"",

I request and require that you bring me Cakes and Ale.\r\n\r\nAt this point, the student produced a copy of the four hundred year old Laws of Cambridge, written in Latin and still nominally in effect, and pointed to the section which read (rough translation from the Latin):\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen sitting examinations may request and require Cakes and Ale\".\r\n\r\nPepsi and hamburgers were judged the modern equivalent, and the student sat there, writing his examination and happily slurping away.\r\n\r\nThree weeks later the student was fined five pounds for not wearing a sword to the examination.",

With the acquisition, Pope John Paul II will become the senior vice-president of the combined company's new Religious Software Division, while MICROSOFT senior vice-presidents Michael Maples and Steven Ballmer will be invested in the College of Cardinals, said MICROSOFT Chairman Bill Gates.\r\n\r\n\"We expect a lot of growth in the religious market in the next five to ten years,\" said Gates. \"The combined resources of MICROSOFT and the Catholic Church will allow us to make religion easier and more fun for a broader range of people.\"\r\n\r\nThrough the MICROSOFT Network, the company's new on-line service, \"we will make the sacraments available on-line for the first time\" and revive the popular pre-Counter-Reformation practice of selling indulgences, said Gates. \"You can get Communion, confess your sins, receive absolution - even reduce your time in Purgatory - all without leaving your home.\"\r\n\r\nA new software application, MICROSOFT Church, will include a macro language which you can program to download heavenly graces automatically while you are away from your computer.\r\n\r\nAn estimated 17,000 people attended the announcement in St Peter's Square, watching on a 60-foot screen as comedian Don Novello - in character as Father Guido Sarducci - hosted the event, which was broadcast by satellite to 700 sites worldwide.\r\n\r\nPope John Paul II said little during the announcement. When Novello chided Gates, \"Now I guess you get to wear one of these pointy hats,\" the crowd roared, but the pontiff's smile seemed strained.\r\n\r\nThe deal grants MICROSOFT exclusive electronic rights to the Bible and the Vatican's prized art collection, which includes works by such masters as Michelangelo and Da Vinci, but critics say MICROSOFT will face stiff challenges if it attempts to limit competitors' access to these key intellectual properties.\r\n\r\n\"The Jewish people invented the look and feel of the holy scriptures,\" said Rabbi David Gottschalk of Philadelphia. \"You take the parting of the Red Sea - we had that thousands of years before the Catholics came on the scene.\"\r\n\r\nBut others argue that the Catholic and Jewish faiths both draw on a common Abrahamic heritage. \"The Catholic Church has just been more successful in marketing it to a larger market. Over the last 2,000 years, the Catholic Church's market share has increased dramatically, while Judaism, which was the first to offer many of the concepts now touted by Christianity, lags behind.\r\n\r\nHistorically, the Church has a reputation as an aggressive competitor, leading crusades to pressure people to upgrade to Catholicism, and entering into exclusive licensing arrangements in various kingdoms whereby all subjects were installed with Catholicism, whether or not they planned to use it. Today Christianity is available from several denominations, but the Catholic version is still the most widely used. The Church's mission is to reach \"the four corners of the earth,\" echoing MICROSOFT's vision of \"a computer on every desktop and in every home\".\r\n\r\nGates described MICROSOFT's long-term strategy to develop a scalable religious architecture that will support all religions through emulation. A single core religion will be offered with a choice of interfaces according to the religion desired - \"One religion, a couple of different implementations,\" said Gates.\r\n\r\nThe MICROSOFT move could spark a wave of mergers and acquisitions, according to Herb Peters, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Baptist Conference, as other churches scramble to strengthen their position in the increasingly competitive religious market.",

It was the man from Microsoft.\r\n\r\n\"Not you again,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry,\" he said, a little sheepishly. \"I guess you know why I'm here.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed I did. Microsoft's $300 million campaign to promote the Windows 95 operating system was meant to be universally effective, to convince every human being on the planet that Windows 95 was an essential, some would say integral, part of living. Problem was, not everyone had bought it. Specifically, I hadn't bought it. I was the Last Human Being Without Windows 95. And now this little man from Microsoft was at my door, and he wouldn't take no for an answer.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"You know I can't take that,\" he said, pulling out a copy of Windows 95 from a briefcase. \"Come on. Just one copy. That's all we ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not interested.\" I said. \"Look, isn't there someone else you can go bother for a while? There's got to be someone else on the planet who doesn't have a copy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, no,\" The Microsoft man said. \"You're the only one.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't be serious. Not everyone on the planet has a computer,\" I said. \"Hell, not everyone on the planet has a PC! Some people own Macintoshes, which run their own operating system. And some people who have PCs run OS/2, though I hear that's just a rumor. In short, there are some people who just have no use for Windows 95.\"\r\n\r\nThe Microsoft man look perplexed. \"I'm missing your point,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Use!\" I screamed. \"Use! Use! Use! Why buy it, if you can't useit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know anything about this 'use' thing you're going on about,\" the Microsoft man said. \"All I know is that according to our records, everyone else on the planet has a copy.\"\r\n\r\n\"People without computers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Got 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amazonian Indians?\"\r\n\r\n\"We had to get some malaria shots to go in, but yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Amish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Check.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come on,\" I said. \"They don't even wear buttons. How did you get them to buy a computer operating system?\"\r\n\r\n\"We told them there were actually 95 very small windows in the box,\" the Microsoft man admitted. \"We sort of lied. Which means we are all going to Hell, every single employee of Microsoft.\" He was somber for a minute, but then perked right up. \"But that's not the point!\" he said. \"The point is, everyone has a copy. Except you.\"\r\n\r\n\"So what?\" I said. \"If everyone else jumped off a cliff, would you expect me to do it, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"If we spent $300 million advertising it? Absolutely.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jeez, back to that again,\" the Microsoft man said. \"Hey. I'll tell you what. I'll give you a copy. For free. Just take it and install it on your computer.\" He waved the box in front of me.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said again. \"No offense, pal. But I don't need it. And frankly, your whole advertising blitz has sort of offended me. I mean, it's a computer operating system! Great. Fine. Swell. Whatever. But you guys are advertising it like it creates world peace or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"It did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon?\"\r\n\r\n\"World peace. It was part of the original design. Really. One button access. Click on it, bang, end to strife and hunger. Simple.\"\r\n\r\n\"So what happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know,\" he said defensively, \"it took up a lot of space on the hard drive. We had to decide between it or the Microsoft Network. Anyway, we couldn't figure out how to make a profit off of world peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go away,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I can't,\" he said. \"I'll be killed if I fail.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have got to be kidding,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" the Microsoft man said. \"We sold this to the Amish. The Amish! Right now, they're opening the boxes and figuring out they've been had. We'll be pitchforked if we ever step into Western Pennsyvania again. But we did it. So to have you holding out, well, it's embarassing. It's embarassing to the company. It's embarassing to the product. It's embarassing to Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bill Gates does not care about me,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"He's watching right now,\" the Microsoft man said. \"Borrowed one of those military spy satellites just for the purpose. It's also got one of those high-powered lasers. You close that door on me, zap, I'm a pile of grey ash.\"\r\n\r\n\"He wouldn't do that,\" I said, \"He might hit that copy of Windows 95 by accident.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Bill's gotten pretty good with that laser,\" the Microsoft man said, nervously.\r\n\"Okay. I wasn't supposed to do this, but you leave me no choice. If you take this copy of Windows 95, we will reward you handsomely. In fact, we'll give you your own Caribbean island! How does Montserrat sound?\"\r\n\r\n\"Terrible. There's an active volcano there.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's only a small one,\" the Microsoft man said.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" I said, \"even if you did convince me to take that copy of Windows 95, what would you do then? You'd have totally saturated the market. That would be it. No new worlds to conquer. What would you do then?\"\r\n\r\nThe Microsoft man held up another box and gave it to me.\r\n\r\n\"'Windows 95....For Pets'?!?!?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a lot of domestic animals out there,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI shut the door quickly.

Here was a chance to make a profit without any initial monetary investment. Naturally, this man then became my competition, so I had my limo driver run over him several times.\"\r\n\r\nMicrosoft engineers have been working around the clock to complete Gates' vision of panhandling for the 21st century. \"We feel that our program designers really understand how the poor and needy situation works,\" says Microsoft Homeless product leader Bernard Liu. \"Except for the fact that they're stinking rich.\"\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Panhandler will be automatically installed with Windows 95. At random intervals, a dialog box pops up, asking the user if they could spare any change so that Microsoft has enough money to get a hot meal. (\"This is a little lie,\" admits software engineer Adam Miller, \"since our diet consists of Coke and Twinkies, but what panhandler doesn't embellish a little?\") The user can click Yes, in which case a random amount of change between $.05 and $142.50 is transferred from the user's bank account to Microsoft's. The user can also respond No, in which case the program politely tells the user to have a nice day. The \"No\" button has not yet been implemented.\r\n\r\n\"We're experiencing a little trouble programming the No button,\" Bernard Liu says, \"but we should definitely have it up and running within the next couple of years. Or at least by the time Windows 2014 comes out. Maybe.\"\r\n\r\nGates says this is just the start of an entire line of products. \"Be on the lookout for products like Microsoft Mugger, which either takes $50 or erases your hard drive, and Microsoft Squeegee Guy, which will clean up your Windows for a dollar.\" (When Microsoft Squeegee Guy ships, Windows 95 will no longer automatically refresh your windows.)\r\n\r\nBut there are competitors on the horizon. Sun Microsystems and Oracle Corporation are introducing panhandling products of their own. \"Gates is a few tacos short of a combination platter, if you get my drift,\" says Oracle Head Honcho and 3rd degree black belt Larry Ellison. \"I mean, in the future, we don't need laptop computers asking you for change. You'll have an entire network of machines asking you for money.\" Gates responded with, \"I know you are, but what am I?\" Then general pandemonium ensued.",

But he needed a creature who could sail the waters, and would need for support but few rams.\r\n\r\nSo the Gateskeeper, who was said to be both micro and soft, caused to be fashioned a Dosfish, who was small and spry, and could swim the narrow sixteen-bit channel. But the Dosfish was not bright, and could be taught but few tricks. His alphabet had no A's, B's, or Q's, but a mere 640 K's, and the size of his file cabinet was limited by his own fat.\r\n\r\nAt first the people loved the Dosfish, for he was the only one who could swim the Pea Sea. But the people soon grew tired of commanding his line, and complained that he could neither be dragged or dropped. \"Forsooth,\" they cried, \"the Dosfish can do only one job at a time, and of names he knows only eight and three.\" And many of them left the Pea Sea for good, and went off in search of the Magic Apple.\r\n\r\nAlthough many went, far more stayed, because admittance to the Pea Sea was cheap. So the Gateskeeper studied the Magic Apple, and rested awile in the Parc of the Xer Ox. And he made a Window that could ride on the Dosfish, and do its thinking for it. But the Window was slow, and it would break when the Dosfish got confused. So most people contented themselves with the Dosfish.\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass that the Blue Giant came upon the Gateskeeper, and spoke thus: \"Come, let us make of ourselves something greater than the Dosfish.\" The Blue Giant seemed like a humbug, so they called the new creature Oz II.\r\n\r\nNow Oz II was smarter than the Dosfish, as most things are. It could drag and drop, and could keep files without becoming fat. But the people cared for it not. So the Blue Giant and the Gateskeeper promised another Oz II, to be called Oz II Too, that could swim fast in the new, 32-bit wide Pea Sea.\r\n\r\nThen lo, a strange miracle occurred. Although the Window that rode on the Dosfish was slow, it was pretty, and the third window was the prettiest of all. And the people began to like the third window, and to use it. So the Gateskeeper turned to the Blue Giant and said \"Fie on thee, for I need thee not. Keep thy Oz II Too, and I shall make of my Window an Entity that will not need the Dosfish, and will swim in the 32-bit Pea Sea.\"\r\n\r\nYears passed, and the workshops of the Gateskeeper and the Blue Giant were many times overrun by insects. And the people went on using their Dosfish with a Window; even though the Dosfish would from time to time become confused and die, it could always be revived with three fingers. Then there came a day when the Blue Giant let forth his Oz II Too onto the world. The Oz II Too was indeed mighty, and awesome, and required a great ram, and the world was changed not a whit. For the people said \"It is indeed great, but we see little application for it.\" And they were doubtful, because the Blue Giant had met with the Magic Apple, and together they were fashioning a Taligent, and the Taligent was made of objects, and was most pink.\r\n\r\nNow the Gateskeeper had grown ambitious, and as he had been ambitious before he grew, he was now more ambitious still. So he protected his Window Entity with great security, and made its net work both in serving and with peers. And the Entity would swim, not in the Pea Sea, but also in the Oceans of Great Risk. \"Yea,\" the Gateskeeper declared, \"though my Entity will require a greater ram than Oz II Too, it will be more powerful than a world of Eunuchs.\r\n\r\nAnd so the gateskeeper prepared to unleash his Entity to the world, in all but two cities. For he promised that a greater Window, a greater Entity, and even a greater Dosfish would appear one day in Chicago and Cairo, and it too would be built of objects.\r\n\r\nNow the Eunuchs who lived in the Oceans of Great Risk, and who scorned the Pea Sea, began to look upon their world with fear. For the Pea Sea had grown and great ships were sailing in it, the Entity was about to invade their Ocenas, and it was rumored that files would be named in letters greater than eight. And the Eunuchs looked upon the Pea Sea, and many of them thought to immigrate.\r\n\r\nWithin the Oceans of Great Risk were many Sun Worshippers, and they had wanted to excel, and make their words perfect, and do their jobs as easy as one-two-three. And what's more, many of them no longer wanted to pay for the Risk. So the Sun Lord went to the Pea Sea, and got himself eighty-sixed.\r\n\r\nAnd taking the next step was he of the NextStep, who had given up building his boxes of black. And he proclaimed loudly that he could help anyone make wondrous soft wares, then admitted meekly that only those who know him could use those wares, and he was made of objects, and required the biggest ram of all.\r\n\r\nAnd the people looked out upon the Pea Sea, and they were sore amazed. And sore confused. And sore sore. And that is why, to this day, Ozes, Entities, and Eunuchs battle on the shores of the Pea Sea, but the people still travel on the simple Dosfish.",

The user will then remain in a state of hibernation until about a week before the Windows 95 ship date.\r\n\r\n\"We expect that the users will need a few days to recuperate and acquaint themselves with the changes that will occur in society between the onset of cold sleep and the release of Windows 95,\" explained a Microsoft spokesman. These may include \"the OJ Simpson trial ending, another m omentous Congressional election, faster-than-light travel and possible leaps in human evolution.\"\r\n\r\nBecause Microsoft expects a large response to this offer, a vast area will be needed for the s torage facility. \"We have chosen the state of Utah,\" stated Microsoft, \"because nobody lives there anyway.\"\r\n\r\nSpokespeople for Novell and WordPerfect were reached for comment on this remark, but their words were not suitable for publication.\r\n\r\nIBM Corporation, which has previously responded to Microsoft promotions with competing offers for their OS/2 Warp said they would not be matching Microsoft's \"Cool User\" program. \"Freeze people? What for? Warp has already been shipping for months,\" said a source who asked not to be identified.\r\n\r\nSome industry analysts have wasted no time hailing Microsoft's plan as a \"bold, innovative\" move. In columnist Michael S. Brown's opinion column \"M.S. Brown Knows\" which appears in PC Weak, Brown claims, \"IBM has missed the boat again with their failing OS/2 strategy. Users clearly want to be frozen in liquid nitrogen and sealed in coffin-like units for an indeterminate period of time.\r\n\r\nMichael S.

Here a bunch of people were sitting in a park playing bingo and feeding dead pigeons.\r\n\r\n\"This is Heaven?\" asked the Windows programmer.\r\n\r\n\"Yup,\" said the angel. \"Then I'll take Hell.\" Instantly he found himself plunged up to his neck in red-hot lava, with the hosts of the damned in torment around him. \"Where's the beach? The music? The volleyball?\" he screamed frantically to the angel.\r\n\r\n\"That was the demo,\" she replied as she vanished.",

The Lost Episode\r\n\r\n          ---------------------------------------------------------\r\nRecent reports of a lost episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation have finally been confirmed. And now, for your reading pleasure, we are proud to present the entire transcript. Enjoy!\r\n          ---------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise have encountered the Borg.\r\n\r\nPicard: \"Mr. LaForge, have you had any success with your attempts at finding a weakness in the Borg? And Mr. Data, have you been able to access their command pathway?\"\r\n\r\nGeordi: \"Yes, Captain. In fact, we found the answer by searching through our archives on late Twentieth-century computing technology.\"\r\n\r\nGeordi presses a key, and a logo appears on the computer screen.\r\n\r\nRiker (looks puzzled): \"What the hell is a Microsoft?\"\r\n\r\nData (turns to answer): \"Allow me to explain. We will send this program, for some reason called 'Windows', through the Borg command pathways. Once inside their root command unit, it will begin consuming system resources at an unstoppable rate.\"\r\n\r\nPicard: \"But the Borg have the ability to adapt. Won't they alter their processing systems to increase their storage capacity?\"\r\n\r\nData: \"Yes, Captain. But when 'Windows' detects this, it creates a new version of itself known as an 'upgrade'. The use of resources increases exponentially with each iteration. The Borg will not be able to adapt quickly enough. Eventually all of their processing ability will be taken over and none will be available for their normal operational functions.\"\r\n\r\nPicard: \"Excellent work. This is even better than that 'unsolvable geometric shape' idea.\"\r\n\r\n                   --------------------------------------\r\n                              15 minutes later\r\n                   --------------------------------------\r\nData: \"Captain, We have successfully installed the 'Windows' in the command unit and as expected it immediately consumed 85% of all resources. We however have not received any confirmation of the expected 'upgrade'.\"\r\n\r\nGeordi: \"Our scanners have picked up an increase in Borg storage and CPU capacity to compensate, but we still have no indication of an 'upgrade' to compensate for their increase.\"\r\n\r\nPicard: \"Data, scan the history banks again and determine if there is something we missed.\"\r\n\r\nData: \"Sir, I believe there is a reason for the failure in the 'upgrade'. Apparently the Borg have circumvented that part of the plan by not sending in their registration cards.\"\r\n\r\nRiker: \"Captain we have no choice. Requesting permission to begin emergency escape sequence 3F.\"\r\n\r\nGeordi (excited): \"Wait, Captain, I just detected their CPU capacity has suddenly dropped to 0%!\"\r\n\r\nPicard: \"Data, what do scanners show?\"\r\n\r\nData: \"Apparently the Borg have found the internal 'Windows' module named 'Solitaire' and it has used up all the CPU capacity.\"\r\n\r\nPicard: \"Let's wait and see how long this 'Solitaire' can reduce their functionality.\"\r\n\r\nRiker: \"Geordi, what's the status of the Borg?\"\r\n\r\nGeordi: \"As expected the Borg are attempting to re-engineer to compensate for increase CPU and storage demands, but each time they successfully increase resources I have setup our closest deep space monitor beacon to transmit more 'Windows' modules from something called the 'Microsoft Fun-Pac One'.\"\r\n\r\nPicard: \"How much time will that buy us?\"\r\n\r\nData: \"Current Borg solutions rates allow me to predicate an interest time span of 6 more hours.\"\r\n\r\nGeordi: \"Captain, another vessel has entered our sector.\"\r\n\r\nPicard: \"Identify.\"\r\n\r\nData: \"It appears to have markings very similar to the 'Microsoft' logo!\"\r\n\r\nOver the speakers: \"This is Admiral Bill Gates of the Microsoft Flagship 'Monopoly'. We have positive confirmation of unregistered sofware in this sector. Surrender all assets and we can avoid any trouble. You have 10 seconds to comply.\"\r\n\r\nData: \"The alien ship has just opened its forward hatches and released thousands of humanoid shaped objects.\"\r\n\r\nPicard: \"Magnify forward viewer on the alien craft!\"\r\n\r\nRiker: \"Good God Captain! Those are humans floating straight toward the Borg ship with no life support suits! How can they survive deep space?!\"\r\n\r\nData: \"I don't believe that those are humans sir, if you look closer I believe you will see that they are carrying something recognized by twenty-first century man as doe skin leather briefcases, and wearing Armani suits!\"\r\n\r\nRiker and Picard (horrified): \"Lawyers!!!\"\r\n\r\nGeordi: \"It can't be. All the lawyers were rounded up and sent hurtling into the sun in 2017 during the Great Awakening.\"\r\n\r\nData: \"True, but apparently some must have survived.\"\r\n\r\nRiker: \"They have surrounded the Borg ship and are convering it with pieces of paper.\"\r\n\r\nData: \"I believe that is known in ancient vernacular as 'red tape' -- it often proves fatal.\"\r\n\r\nRiker: \"They're tearing the Borg to pieces!\"\r\n\r\nPicard: \"Turn off the monitors.

        "body": "Focus Magazine Interview with Bill Gates\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Code Has No Bugs (that Microsoft cares about)\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\nIn an interview for German weekly magazine Focus (nr.43, October 23, 1995, pages 206-212), Microsoft`s Mr. Bill Gates has made some tements about software quality of MS products. After lengthy inquiries about how PCs should and could be used (including some angry comments on some questions which Mr. Gates evidently did not like), the interviewer comes to storage requirements of MS products; it ends with the following dispute:\r\n\r\n          ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n  FOCUS: Every new release of a software which has less bugs than the older one is also more complex and has more features...\r\n\r\nGates: No, only if that is what'll sell!\r\n\r\nFOCUS: But...\r\n\r\nGates: Only if that is what'll sell! We've never done a piece of software unless we thought it would sell. That's why everything we do in software ...it's really amazing: We do it because we think that's what customers want. That's why we do what we do.\r\n\r\nFOCUS: But on the other hand, you would say: Okay, folks, if you don't like these new features, stay with the old version, and keep the bugs?\r\n\r\nGates: No! We have lots and lots of competitors. The new version, it's not there to fix bugs. That's not the reason we come up with a new version.\r\n\r\nFOCUS: But there are bugs an any version which people would really like to have fixed.\r\n\r\nGates: No! There are no significant bugs in our released software that any significant number of users want fixed.\r\n\r\nFOCUS: Oh, my God. I always get mad at my computer if MS Word swallows the page numbers of a document which I printed a couple of times with page numbers. If I complain to anybody they say \"Well, upgrade from version 5.11 to 6.0\".\r\n\r\nGates: No! If you really think there's a bug you should report a bug. Maybe you're not using it properly. Have you ever considered that?\r\n\r\nFOCUS: Yeah, I did...\r\n\r\nGates: It turns out Luddites don't know how to use software properly, so you should look into that. The reason we come up with new versions is not to fix bugs. It's absolutely not. It's the stupidest reason to buy a new version I ever heard. When we do a new version we put in lots of new things that people are asking for, and so, in no sense, is stability a reason to move to a new version. It's never a reason.\r\n\r\nFOCUS: How come I keep being told by computer vendors, \"Well, we know about this bug, wait till the next version is there, it'll be fixed\"? I hear this all the time. How come? If you're telling me there are no significant bugs in software and there is no reason to do a new version?\r\n\r\nGates: No. I'm saying: We don't do a new version to fix bugs. We don't. Not enough people would buy it. You can take a hundred people using Microsoft Word. Call them up and say, \"Would you buy a new version because of bugs?\"\r\n\r\nYou won't get a single person to say they'd buy a new version because of bugs. We'd never be able to sell a release on that basis.\r\n\r\nFOCUS: Probably you have other contacts to your software developers. But if Mister Anybody, like me, calls up a store or a support line and says, \"Hey listen, there's a bug\" ... 90 percent of the time I get the answer \"Oh, well, yeah, that's not too bad, wait to the next version and it'll be fixed\". That's how the system works.\r\n\r\nGates: Guess how much we spend on phone calls every year.\r\n\r\nFOCUS: Hm, a couple of million dollars?\r\n\r\nGates: 500 million dollars a year. We take every one of these phone calls and classify them. That's the input we use to do the next version. So it's like the worlds biggest feedback loop. People call in, we decide what to do on it. Do you want to know what percentage of those phonecalls relates to bugs in the software? Less than one percent.\r\n\r\nFOCUS: So people call in to say \"Hey listen, I would love to have this and that feature\"?\r\n\r\nGates: Actually, that's about five percent. Most of them call to get advice on how to do a certain thing with the software. That's the primary thing. We could have you sit and listen to these phone calls. There are millions and millions of them. It really isn't statistically significant. Sit in and listen to Win 95 calls, sit in and listen to Word calls, and wait, just wait for weeks and weeks for someone to call in and say \"Oh, I found a bug in  this thing\"....\r\n\r\nFOCUS: So where does this common feeling of frustration come from that unites all the PC users? Everybody experiences it every day that these things simply don't work like they should.\r\n\r\nGates: Because it's cool. It's like, \"Yeah, been there done that. Oh, yeah, I know that bug.\" I can understand that phenomenon sociologically, not technically.\r\n\r\n          ---------------------------------------------------------\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n      * Bug reports are statistically, therefore actually, unimportant;\r\n      * If you want a bug fixed, you are (by definition) in the minority;\r\n      * Microsoft doesn't fix bugs because bug fixes are not a significant source of revenue;\r\n      * If you think you found a bug, you are wrong, because really it only means you're incompetent; and\r\n      * People only complain about bugs to show how cool they are, not because bugs cause any real problems.",

        "body": "Beyond the Hype (Guardian, August 25, 1995)\r\n\r\nDouglas Adams, author of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, argues Windows 95 does not cross any frontiers.\r\n\r\nWhat on Earth is going on? Have we found intelligent life on other planets? Abolished war and famine? Found Elvis? Have we even devised a new and better way of using computers? No. All that's happened is that Microsoft has remodelled its operating system so that it's now more like the Macintosh.\r\n\r\nThis may well be a cause for rejoicing among Windows users but it's hardly a giant leap for mankind and doesn't warrant this sense that we're all supposed to celebrate early and avoid the millennium rush.\r\n\r\nAs part of this billion-dollar festival of smoke and mirrors, Bill Gates has apparently paid the Rolling Stones 8 million pounds for the right to use Start Me Up, the song which is better known for its catchy refrain \"You make a grown man cry\".\r\n\r\nThis is a phrase you may hear a lot of over the next few days as millions of people start trying to install Windows 95. Even the best designed systems can be a nightmare to upgrade, but whatever things Microsoft may be famous for - the wealth of its founder, the icy grip he exerts on what is arguably the most important industry on this planet - good systems design is not, as it happens, one of them.\r\n\r\nLet's dispel a few myths. There's one which says that the original PC operating system was a brilliant feat of programming by boy genius Bill Gates. It wasn't brilliant and Gates didn't write it. He acquired it, \"shrewdly\", from the Seattle Computer Company and then immediately licensed it on to another, larger, outfit called IBM. When the IBM PC was launched into a market which had hitherto been serviced by garage companies named after bits of fruit, it carried the impimatur of a world-renowned name and sold a zillion, making Gates' operating system a world standard. IBM had failed to realise that any fool could make the boxes, but the hand that owned the software ruled the world. Big Blue had given the kid Gates a free ride into the stratosphere and then, astoundingly, found itself starting to fall away like a discarded booster rocket.\r\n\r\nSadly this new world software standard was actually a piece of crap.\r\n\r\nMS-DOS, as Gates called it, had started life as QDOS-86 or the Quick & Dirty Operating System, which told you all you needed to know about it. A whole generation of people doggedly learned to run their businesses on a system that was written as a quick lash-up for hobbyists and hackers. Was there anything better around? Of course.\r\n\r\nIn the 1970's, Xerox had funded a team of the world's top computer scientists to research the man/machine interface. They devised a graphical system, using windows, icons and mice. Their key insight was that a lot of needless complications could be cut short by harnessing people's intuitive and gestural skills. Oddly, Xerox failed to follow this up, and the research was taken up and brought to the market by Apple Computer as the Macintosh. After a shaky, underpowered start, this machine matured into a well-integrated system which was not only very powerful, but a real pleasure to use. Mac users tend to have an almost fanatical devotion to their machines.\r\n\r\nThe Microsoft line on all this was that Windows was for wimps. The truth was that plain old MS-DOS couldn't actually do them. Graphics, mice, networking, and a whole lot else, had to be added to the basic core of QDOS as one afterthought after another, which is why Wintel computers are so fiendishly complicated to set up and maintain.\r\n\r\nGates, however, had always known which way the future lay, and for years Microsoft managed the awkward juggling act of rubbishing Apple's user interface while simultaneously trying to devise something like it that would fit on top of the bloated clutter that MS-DOS had become.\r\n\r\nBYTE magazine said recently: \"It would not be an exaggeration to describe the history of the computer in the past decade as a massive effort to keep up with Apple.\" However, the Macintosh is not the last word on interface design, and if Microsoft had been the innovative company that it calls itself, it would have taken the opportunity to take a radical leap beyond the Mac, instead of producing a feeble, me-too, implementation.\r\n\r\nAn awful lot of people who try to install Windows 95 will end up having to spend so much money buying extra RAM and upgrading their peripherals to get features that Mac users have enjoyed for years, that they might as well give up and buy the real thing.\r\n\r\nThe idea that Bill Gates has appeared like a knight in shining armour to lead all customers out of a mire of technological chaos neatly ignores the fact that it was he who, by peddling second-rate technology, led them into it in the first place.",

It's right across the street, so I can run home if I get lonely in the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about transportation? \" the father asked.\r\n\"I have my wagon, and we both have our tricycles,\" the little boy answered. The boy had an answer to every question the father raised.\r\n\r\nFinally, in exasperation, the man asked, \"What about babies? When you're married, you're liable to have babies, you know.\"\r\n\"We've thought about that, too,\" the little boy replied. \"We're not going to have babies.

Although the old man and his clothes were spotlessly clean, he wore jeans, a denim shirt and boots that were very worn and ragged. In his hand he carried a worn out old hat and an equally worn out Bible.\r\n\r\nThe church he entered was in a very upscale and exclusive part of the city. It was the largest and most beautiful church the old cowboy had ever seen. The people of the congregation were all dressed with expensive clothes and accessories.\r\n\r\nAs the cowboy took a seat, the others moved away from him. No one greeted, spoke to, or welcomed him. They were all appalled at his appearance and did not attempt to hide it.\r\nAs the old cowboy was leaving the church, the preacher approached him and asked the cowboy to do him a favor.\r\n\r\n\"Before you come back in here again, have a talk with God, and ask him what he thinks would be appropriate attire for worship.\" The old cowboy assured the preacher he would.\r\n\r\nThe next Sunday, he showed back up for the services wearing the same ragged jeans, shirt, boots, and hat. Once again he was completely shunned and ignored.\r\n\r\nThe preacher again approached the man and said, \"I thought I asked you to speak to God before you came back to our church.\"\r\n\"I did,\" replied the old cowboy.\r\n\"If you spoke to God, what did he tell you the proper attire should be for worshiping in here?\" asked the preacher.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, God told me that He didn't have a clue what I should wear. He said He'd never been in this church.\"",

He's coming into Seattle airport, only there is thick fog, less than 10ft of visibility, and his instruments are out. So he circles around looking for a landmark. After an hour or so, he's pretty low on fuel and the passengers are getting very nervous. At last, in a small opening in the fog, he sees a tall building with one guy working alone on the fifth floor.\r\n\r\nThe pilot banks the plane around and winds down the window and shouts to the guy, \"Hi! Where am I?\", to which the solitary office worker replies, \"You're in a plane\". The pilot winds up the window, executes a 275 degree turn and proceeds to execute a perfect blind landing on the runway of the airport 5 miles away. Just as the plane stops, so does the engine as the fuel has run out.\r\n\r\nThe passengers are amazed and one asks how he did it. \"Simple,\" replies the pilot. \"The answer he gave me was 100% correct, but absolutely useless; therefore, that must be Microsoft's Support Office and from there the airport is just 5 miles away on a course of 87 degrees! Any questions?\"",

Yesterday I sent a fax to my wife I'd be home that night, and when I got into my room I found my wife in another man's arms. Why Dad? Tell me why!\"\r\nDad kept silent for a few minutes, then coolly said, \"Maybe, son, she didn't get the fax.\"\r\n\r\nA wife, one evening, drew her husband's attention to the couple next door and said, \"Do you see that couple? How devoted they are? He kisses her every time they meet. Why don't you do that?\" \"I would love to,\" replied the husband, \"but I don't know her well enough.\"\r\n\r\nThe wife phoned her husband in the office and said, \"Darling, come home early, we are going to have mother for dinner.\" \"Good,\" replied the husband, \"make sure she's well done.\"\r\n\r\nThen there was this ten-year old child who shot both his parents and pleaded with the judge for mercy because he was an orphan.\r\n\r\nDad: Son, what do you want for your birthday?\r\nSon: Just a radio, dad, with a sports car around it.\r\n\r\nThe girl asked her lover, \"Darling, if we get engaged will you give me a ring?\" \"Sure,\" replied her lover \"What's your number?\"\r\n\r\nYoung Man: Would you like to dance with me?\r\nYoung Woman: Do you expect me to dance with a baby?\r\nYoung Man: I'm so sorry.

If he is bald from front to back - he thinks he is sexy.\r\n\r\nA young woman went into a bank to withdraw some money. \"Can you identify yourself?\" asked the bank clerk. The young woman opened her handbag, took out a mirror, looked into it and said, \"Yes, it's me alright.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know I own a bank now?\"\r\n\"Oh really, what is the name of your bank?\"\r\n\"Piggy.\"\r\n\r\nA psychiatrist met a friend and exclaimed, \"I heard you died.\"\r\n\"But you see I'm alive,\" smiled the friend.\r\n\"Impossible,\" said the psychiatrist. \"The man who told me is much more reliable than you.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor: We operated on your eyes and we've managed to save one of them.\r\nPatient: Oh, thank you very much.\r\nDoctor: Yes, we'll give it to you on your way out.\r\n\r\nA doctor sent a bill to his patient.

Each plays one major prank on the other during the month - neither know when they will be pranked or what will happen when they are. Here are a couple of the things that they have done to each other:\r\n\r\n1. One year Erik took police caution tape and completely wraped Dan's jeep up in it. He took the tape over and under the jeep so that the only visible parts of the car were the tires. He then took the tape across the street and into the house to his bedroom door. When Dan woke up and followed the tape to his front door he saw his entire jeep in yellow tape!\r\n\r\n2. Another year Dan entered an ad in the pets section for a 'dog' looking for a home the dog was \"female, name: Coleen, good with kids, has red hair, happy, loving, looking for a good family.\" Erik got so many phone calls for this friendly 'dog' named Coleen that he had to disconnect his phone for 2 weeks! It gets better; Coleen is his girlfriend and when one guy called, my aunt answered the phone pretending to be Coleen the man was so embarrassed he quickly said, \"I'm soo sorry,\" then hung the phone up.\r\n\r\n3. One other year Erik was pulled over by a cop as he was leaving Dan's house, put in handcuffs and put in the back of a cop car, told his rights and told he could make one phone call after he was in the back of the cop car. He called Dan since he was just leaving Dan's house. Dan rushed up the street and when the cop opened the car door he said, \"What's wrong?\" Of course Erik didn't know what was going on, and by now needed another pair of pants. Dan said \"April Fool!\" and Erik was released from the car and allowed to go back home. My uncle had a cop friend who had agreed to arrest Erik falsely for Dan as a joke. My brother was hiding in the bushes the whole time videotaping the whole thing!",

Finally, after several days, the fisherman said, \"Let's not decide on names right now. If we wait a little while, the names will simply occur to us.\" \r\n\r\nAfter several weeks had passed, the fisherman and his wife noticed a peculiar fact. When left alone, one of the boys would also turn towards the sea, while the other boy would face inland. It didn't matter which way the parents positioned the children, the same child always faced the same direction. \"Let's call the boys Towards and Away,\" suggested the fisherman. His wife agreed, and from that point on, the boys were simply known as Towards and Away. \r\n\r\nThe years passed and the lads grew tall and strong. The day came when the aging fisherman said to his sons, \"Boys, it is time that learned how to make a living from the sea.\" They provisioned their ship, said their goodbyes, and set sail for a three month voyage. \r\n\r\nThe three months passed quickly for the fisherman's wife, yet the ship had not returned. Another three months passed, and still no ship. Three whole years passed before the greiving woman saw a lone man walking towards her house. She recognized him as her husband. \"My goodness! What has happened to my darling boys?\" she cried. \r\n\r\nThe ragged fisherman began to tell his story: \"We were just barely one whole day out to see when Towards hooked into a great fish. Towards fought long and hard, but the fish was more than his equal. For a whole week they wrestled upon the waves without either of them letting up. Yet eventually the great fish started to win the battle, and Towards was pulled over the side of our ship. He was swallowed whole, and we never saw either of them again.\" \r\n\r\n\"Oh dear, that must have been terrible!

        "body": "MORNING WOOD!\r\n\r\nGet ready... this is quite possibly one of the funniest true stories I've read in a long while! No matter how many times I read it, I still can't keep the tears away!\r\nI caution the weak of heart before reading today's joke - you know who you are - so you might as well hit the \"delete\" key now...\r\n\r\n(The author is responding to a woman who accidentally walked into the men's restroom):\r\n\r\nPlease don't feel bad. It wasn't you entering the men's washroom that caused that guy to pee on the guy next to him. Hell, we do that all the time. It's rare us guys ever hit what we're aiming for. Sometimes I go into the washroom, start to pee, and then just start spinning around, just so I'll make sure I hit something.\r\n\r\nYou see, something you ladies should understand by now is that men's penises have a mind of their own. A guy can go into a bathroom stall because all the urinals are being used, take perfect aim at the toilet, and his penis will still manage to piss all over the toilet paper, down his left pant leg, and onto his shoe. I'm telling ya, those little buggers can't be trusted.\r\n\r\nAfter being married 28 years, my wife has me trained. I'm no longer allowed to pee like a man - standing up. I am required to sit down and pee. She has convinced me that this is a small price to pay. Otherwise, if she had gone to the toilet one more time at night and either sat on a pee soaked toilet seat, or fallen right into the toilet because I forgot to put the seat down, she was going to kill me in my sleep.\r\n\r\nNow another thing us guys don't usually like to talk about, but because you and I have become such good friends and you think I'm such a classy guy, I might as well be candid with you because it's a real problem, and you ladies need to be understanding about it. It's the dreaded \"morning wood\".\r\n\r\nMost mornings us guys wake up with two things. A tremendous desire to pee, and a penis so hard you could cut diamonds with it. Well, no matter how hard you try, you can't get that thing to bend, and if it won't bend, you can't aim. Well, hell, if you can't aim you have no choice but to piss all over the wallpaper and that damn fuzzy toilet seat cover you women insist on putting on the toilet.\r\n\r\nAnd by the way, when you use those damn fuzzy toilet seat covers, the friggin' toilet seat won't stay up by itself, so that means we have to use one hand to hold up the toilet seat and the other hand to try to control our less than perfect aim. Now sometimes, when you're newly married, (and I know the guys in here will back me up on this) you think you can get the toilet seat with that damn fuzzy thing to stay up. You jam it back and compress that fuzzy thing until the seat stays there. OK, so you start to pee, but then that compressed fuzzy starts to decompress and without warning that damn toilet seat comes flying down and tries to whack off your weenie - so us guys will not lift a toilet seat with a fuzzy, it's just not safe.\r\n\r\nI tried to delicately explain this morning situation to my wife, I told her, \"Look, it won't bend.\" She said, \"so sit down like I told you to do all the rest of the time.\"\r\n\r\nOK. I tried sitting down on the toilet with \"morning wood\". Well, it's very hard to get it bent under the toilet seat, and before I could manage it, I had pissed all over the bath towels hanging on the wall across the room. Now, even if you are sitting down and you can get it forced down under the toilet seat, when you start to pee, the pee shoots out from the crack between the bottom of the toilet seat and the top of the bowl. You piss all over the back of your knees and it runs down the back of our legs on to that matching fuzzy horseshoe rug you keep putting on the floor in front of the toilet.\r\n\r\nI have found the only effective maneuver to deal with this morning urinary dilemma is to assume the flying Superman position laying over the toilet seat. This takes a great deal of practice, perfect balance, and split time precision but it's the only sure way to get all the pee in the bowl during the first morning pee. So you ladies have to understand that us men are not totally to blame. We are sensitive to your concerns about hygiene and bathroom cleanliness, but there are times when things just get beyond our control. It's not our fault, it's just Mother Nature.",

One day his assistant was in his office and he noticed a sheet of paper on his desk and he figured it must of been the poets newest work.\r\n\r\nThe assistant could not understand the poem so he took it over to the neighbor whom was much wiser than he. The neighbor looked at the poem and declared, \"It is clearly a tribute to the troops in Iraq\", but this could not be so since this was the 1830's and there was no war in Iraq yet, so they took the poem to the psychologist who was much wiser than they.\r\n\r\nThe pychologist looked at this and said, \"This is obviously a poem about a woman whom he loves\", but this could not be since there were only two females in this town one that was 75 and another that was only 4, so the assistant, the neighbor, and the psychologist took the poem to the painter whom was much wiser than they. The artist looked at the poem long and hard and finally stated, \"This is obviously related to the poet having financial issues\", but this could not be since the poet was a very wealthy man.\r\n\r\nThe town argued for 3 hours over the meaning of the poem when a hobo saw the ruckus. He asked what the problem was and the townspeople explained to him their confusion and showed him the paper. After only a few seconds the hobo said, \"This is a receipt for wine and a $5 lap dance at The Pimps Titty Bar\".",

When the manager comes to the mic, speak English and inquire as to why the order taker had such difficulty understanding you.\r\n\r\n8. Repeat everything the order-taker says.\r\n\r\n9.

        "body": "There was once a boy born named Jeff. When Jeff was born, he only had a father, since his mother had died giving birth, and as a result, he was also an only child. His father looked at his new son, proud over his new baby's good looks and wise looking appearance. The father had high hopes for his baby.\r\n\r\nSoon, Jeff was already 4, and was sent to the local preschool. There, although the teachers said that he was a little misbehaved, still socialized a lot and made many friends. As a result, Jeff made his father proud of his son. When summer came and preschool ended, the father asked his son what he wanted as a present for making him so proud. Jeff thought a second and replied, \"I want a yellow golf ball\". So, without hesitation, the happy father bought his son a yellow golf ball.\r\n\r\nTime passed, and Jeff was already in elementary school. Kindergarten was the same as preschool, so was first grade and second grade, Jeff had a great time, making friends and etc. Then when 3rd grade came Jeff was soon encountered with many obstacles, such as the popularity food chain and academics. Although, conquering these problems, Jeff managed to overcome them and get great grades, straight A's in fact. His father was so proud, and on graduation day, he asked him, \"Jeff, what do you want for your graduation present?\" Jeff replied, \"I want a yellow golf ball.\" The father now got a little curious, wondering why Jeff wanted another yellow golf ball. But, he still bought him the yellow golf ball.\r\n\r\nThe summer zipped right by, and Jeff found him into the world of middle school. 6th-8th grade was challenging and tough, and distracted by a small crush in 7th grade, Jeff got an A-, although he soon got over it and got straight A's again. By 8th grade, Jeff was Valedictorian of his grade. His father was very very proud of Jeff, and when graduation day came again, he proudly hugged his son and let everyone know it was his flesh and blood that was valedictorian of the entire grade. So, he asked his son what he wanted for his graduation present, as well as a gift fro making him so proud. Jeff, again, said, \"I want a yellow golf ball\". With these words, the father got very curious, why over these years all his son wanted were yellow golf balls? He gave him other options, \"Gee son, you know...you really made your old man proud. I'll get you anything. Do you want a, uh...Xbox 360? An HDTV? Orrr...\" Jeff just calmly said, \"I want a yellow golf ball\". Now, for the third time in his life, he bought Jeff a yellow golf ball.\r\n\r\nNow, Jeff is in High School, where real challenges came. Jeff went through things such as peer pressure, curiosity, even more academic stress, and once again, the popularity chain. Freshman year went bumpy, although Jeff still delivered his usual amount of straight A's. In Sophomore year he got a girlfriend and smoked his first cigarette, decreasing his perfect grades, piling up A-'s and even a B. Of course, she dumped him in junior year, which sent him into depression; getting B's and even a C+. Then, when the SAT's came, Jeff got serious. He prepared for it and although it was difficult, he aced it. Although, when senior year came, Jeff had to decide to completely put himself together and he quit smoking and once again managed to get the straight A's. He was, once again, valedictorian. His father was now so proud of him. After graduation, he asked his son, \"Jeff, you have filled my life with such happiness, I want to pay you back. What do YOU want the most?\" Jeff thought a second, and said, \"I want a yellow golf ball.\" There was an awkward silence, and the father was dumbfounded, and said, \"You sure? You don't...want a car or anything...maybe a pony?\" \"I want a yellow golf ball.\" \"Well...okay then.\" So, almost against his will, he bought his son another yellow golf ball.\r\n\r\nJeff got into Harvard University, and the circle once again repeated. He encountered same obstacles, which now he was prepared for and easily avoided/defeated. He got perfect scores and even a girlfriend, who dumped him shortly after. He still had many friends and got into graduate school, which he did not plan on going to since he decided he wanted to have a life. All the professors loved him, and every student looked up to him. He was the role model student of Harvard. Soon, the 4 years passed and graduation day came once again. His father had heard of him and his reputation he had made for himself at the school and for his future. He was so proud of him and thanked God for blessing him with such a talented boy as a child. Since Jeff was over 20 and officially a man now, at home after his graduation party his father popped a couple of beers and congratulated his son, and in all the happiness he asked, \"Son...I cannot even describe what you have done for me...what do you want for your present? I will get you it.\" Jeff smiled and said, \"I want a yellow golf ball\" Right there his father just stood there for 5 seconds completely dumbfounded and confused. Why were yellow golf balls such an interest to his son? They could literally afford anything now (they were rich, you know, since all his son wanted were yellow golf balls). He said, \"Are you absolutely sure? You don't want...a Ferrari, a house, a yacht?\" \"I want a yellow golf ball\" So, feeling helpless but still happy at his son's achievements, he bought Jeff a yellow golf ball.\r\n\r\nJeff soon went to live away from his father and on his own, although he still loved him very much. He became CEO of both Microsoft and Macintosh, and he managed to combine the two companies, making him dirty stinking' rich. But, he was humble and lived in a quiet house in Kentucky. However, one day tragedy struck, Jeff was engaged in a car accident involving an Asian driving student. He was hospitalized and told his condition was fatal. His father was contacted immediately. He saw his magnificent son, now in a mangled state, and in all the sadness he asked Jeff, ignoring all financial factors, what he wanted. He would get him anything, anything in the entire world. Jeff laid there in the hospital bed, weak, although through some strength, he said, \"Dad...I want...a yellow golf ball\" The father just went, \"..............\", and now furious over the curiosity, he asked his son hastily although gently, \"Why do you want a yellow golf ball? Really. All these years, why?\" \"I want a yellow golf ball.\" \"...No, not unless you tell me\" Jeff now sighed and said, \"Well, father, I want a yellow golf ball because--\"\r\n\r\nThen he died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis joke is dedicated to the friend that told me it, David S.",

The first few days of the cruise are perfect but then calamity - the ship sinks and Bobby ends up on a small, uncharted island. He looks around and sees that there is nothing nearby except bananas and coconuts. Still, these are better than starving to death.\r\n\r\nTen weeks later, as he is sitting in the shade, to his surprise a small boat lands on the beach and the most beautiful woman he has ever seen gets out, walks over to him and says, \"Hi.\"\r\n\r\nHe can't believe his luck. He replies, \"Hi to you too. Where on earth have you come from? How did you get here? What's your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on,\" she says, \"one question at a time. I landed on the other side of this island about 10 weeks ago when my cruise liner sank. I've just rowed here from the other side. Oh, and my name is Hannah.\" \r\n\r\n\"That's amazing, Hannah,\" he says. \"My name is Bobby. You were lucky to have a rowboat wash up with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, this?\" replies Hannah, \"I made it myself out of raw materials I found on the island. The oars are made from pine tree branches, I wove the bottom from palm branches and the sides came from a Eucalyptus tree.\" \"But where did you get the tools from?\" he asks.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I made the tools myself,\" replies Hannah. \"I found an unusual strata of exposed alluvial rock which I heated in my kiln. It melted into a soft iron-like material which I used to make the tools which in turn I used to make the boat.\"\r\n\r\nBobby is silent. He can't believe her skills. \"If it's OK with you, why don't I now row you to my place?\" she says. \r\nBobby just nods his acceptance.\r\n\r\nIt takes Hannah just ten minutes to row to her place. As they near the shore, Bobby is surprised to see a stone walkway leading up to a very smart sky blue bungalow. Hannah ties up her boat at a small jetty using a hand made flaxen rope, and they enter the bungalow.\r\n\r\n\"It's not really much,\" says Hannah, \"but to me, Bobby, it's home. Please sit down and I'll get you a drink.\" \r\n\"No thanks,\" Bobby replies, \"I just couldn't drink any more coconut juice.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you don't have to have coconut juice,\" says Hannah, \"How about a Pina Colada? I've made a still.\" As they sit down on her hand made couch drinking their Pina Coladas, Bobby looks around and is amazed at what Hannah has achieved in such a short time. After a while, Hannah gets up and says, \"I'm going to slip into something more comfortable. While you're waiting, why don't you take a shower and then have a shave? You'll find a razor in the bathroom cabinet.\"\r\n\r\nBobby goes into the bathroom and runs his bath. It even has hot water from a kind of thermal heating device Hannah has rigged up. After his bath, he goes to the wooden cabinet and finds a razor made of shells roped together inside a swivel mechanism. While he's having an excellent shave, Bobby thinks, \"Hannah is unbelievable, truly amazing - whatever will I discover next? She can do anything.\" \r\n\r\nWhen he returns, Hannah greets him wearing only a few carefully placed vine leaves and smelling of honeysuckle - she looks utterly fantastic. Hanna beckons Bobby to sit next to her, which he does. Hannah smiles at Bobby in a seductive manner and slithers up closer to him.\r\n\r\n\"Bobby,\" she says, staring into his eyes, \"we've both been out here for 10 weeks. Now you've found me, is there something you really feel like doing right now, something you've been longing to do for all these weeks. You know...\" \r\n\r\nBobby can't believe it. \"You mean - I can check my e-mails from here?\"",

Lauderdale made a wrong turn and came nose to nose with a United 727.\r\n\r\nThe irate ground controller (a female) screamed, \"US Air 2771, where are you going?

I know it's difficult to tell the difference between C's & D's, but try to get it right!\"\r\n\r\nContinuing her tongue lashing to the embarrassed crew, she was now shouting hysterically, \"God, you've screwed everything up; it'll take forever to sort this out. You stay right there and don't move until I tell you to! Then I want you to go exactly where I tell you, when I tell you, and how I tell you. You got that, US Air 2771?\"\r\n\r\nThe humbled crew responded, \"Yes, Ma'am.\"\r\n\r\nThe ground control frequency went terribly silent; no one wanted to engage the irate ground controller in her current state, and tension in every cockpit was running high. \r\n\r\nEventually an unknown male pilot broke the silence, asking, \"Controller, wasn't I married to you once?\"",

He's been going through this pain since he was around 20 and no doctor has ever been able to help him out in curing the pain though he has tried almost every pain killer, and several surgeries.\r\n\r\n  One day a doctor calls him in to talk. The man expects another prescription of pain meds and what-not so he goes in, but he's shocked to find that this doctor has actually figured out what's wrong.\r\n\r\n  \"You see, sir,\" says the doctor, \"You have a very very rare condition where your testicles press up against the base of your spine sending a searing pain directly to your brain.\"\r\n\r\nThe man is shocked, so he asks the most obvious question though he's sure he knows the answer already. \"Doc, what are we going to do about it?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor replies solemnly that he will have to go under the knife and have his testicles removed. The man agrees, fearing living through the pain for the rest of his life.\r\nThe operation goes perfectly and in six days the man is up and moving, completely pain free. The next day he decides to go out and buy a nice suit because he can know go out and enjoy himself.\r\n\r\nWhen he gets there, an elderly man is sitting at the counter, and upon seeing the man he stood up and shouted as loud as he could, \"I bet you need a size 36 sports jacket and a pair of trousers with 37 leg and 32 waist.\"\r\n\r\nThe man was stunned, muttering, \"Well, that's exactly right; how on earth did you know?\"\r\n\r\nThe elderly man replied laughing, \"Son, I've been in the business for 50 years, there ain't no one that can fool me.\"\r\n\r\nSo the man tried on his clothes and they fit perfectly. The old man smiled again and said, \"What did I tell you, I've been in the business for 50 years!\"\r\n\r\nSo the man stood in line to buy his new clothing when he realized he needed new underwear as well, so he turned to the old man and said, \"I bet you can't guess my size in underwear.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man looked him up and down and the announced, \"You need a size 10\"\r\n\r\nThe man then laughed and said, \"I got you! I've been wearing a size 8 since I was about 20!\"\r\n\r\nNow the old man was puzzled and said, \"Well sir, to be frank that's impossible.

He saw an Xbox and he knew he got enough money for it, so he said he wanted an Xbox and the cashier said: \"Your Xbox will be delivered in 2 or 3 days.\" In 2 days, the doorbell rang. He knew it is the Xbox he ordered. Outside was a man with glasses, holding a box where Ronald thought inside was an Xbox, but when he opened it, he was shocked.\r\n\r\nIt was a box marked with an X on the cover and inside was a game for Xbox only. Thus a bad discussion went through:\r\n\r\n\"I said I want an Xbox!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is your Xbox with a game for Xbox also!\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's a box with an X marked on it. I want the Xbox!\"\r\n\r\n\"But that's your Xbox!\"\r\n\r\n\"The digital type!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ohhhh! I will call the president of our company. Maybe he can fix the problem.\"\r\n\r\nAfter 2 weeks, he got another box but this time, the man with glasses didn't appear. The box was just sitting there, on the rocky path to the door. He picked it up. It seemed to be heavy. When he opened it, a letter with an Anvil said:\r\n\r\nDear Ronald\r\n  I know you wanted an Xbox but the one you might have seen in the store, the digital one, was reserved for someone else before you asked for it. Send me a letter back if you want to know who owns it.\r\n\r\nSo Ronald sent a letter to the president. After a while, the reply came to Ronald. It was a very rude letter:\r\n\r\nDear Ronald\r\n\r\n  The Xbox belonged to me, because I was really poor and just stole money to buy the store and Xbox. It's busted now, so you can never have it!\r\n\r\nRonald was very angry. Then he told the police to put a \"pretend\" bill to the president for breaking the Xbox.",

It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.\r\n\r\nHe ran onto the field as you fell, waved his wang, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground. Then he whirled his wang at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Harry said, gripping his wang very tightly, and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom.

You will be immediately placed at the top of the S.H.I.T. list, and our managers are especially skilled at seeing that you get all the S.H.I.T. that you can handle.\r\n\r\nEmployees who don't take their S.H.I.T. will be placed in DEPARTMENTAL EMPLOYEES EVALUATION PROGRAMS (D.E.E.P.S.H.I.T.).

The next morning the chemist and engineer tell the mathematician about the fire. She admits she saw it. They ask her why she didn't put it out. She replies contemptuously \"there was a fire and a bucket of water: a solution obviously existed.\"",

Tomorrow, I will don the the uniform of the academic and re-enter society, NOT as I once was, a worker and pawn of the educated classes, but as a peer of those very people. Tomorrow, I shall become an academic!\r\n\r\nJan 4th, 1995\r\nDressed in a pair of green slacks with shortened legs, red cardigan and egg-yolk-stained tee-shirt; sporting a scraggly beard and armed only with a pipe, I stepped onto the university campus. Immediately upon mumbling some incomprehensible gibberish, I was greeted on with respect and awe by my fellow academia. Applying for tenure was simple. The questions were very direct:\r\n\r\nThey: Do you know what you're doing?\r\nMe: This is Belgium, right?\r\nThey: You have a masters in English?\r\nMe: I have a Red Volvo!\r\nThey: And you're applying for a position in the department of Physics?\r\nMe: I think sometimes, therefore I am illogical!\r\n\r\nI was appointed immediately and released to an unsuspecting student population.\r\n\r\nJan 5th, 1995\r\nToday was my first as a lecturer. I prepared concientiously by drinking heavily, watching lots of television and going to bed very late the preceding night turning up at my lecture the prescribed 1 minute late, I spoke of Yeats and the passion of his poetry. The first year Physics students were left speechless.\r\n\r\nJan 6th, 1995\r\nI did not go to work today, due to my thinking it was Saturday.\r\n\r\nJan 7th, 1995\r\nI did not go to work today, due to my thinking it was a Wednesday.\r\n\r\nJan 8th, 1995\r\nI went to work today and was distressed at the lack of attendance.\r\n\r\nJan 9th, 1995\r\nBeing conscientious in the maintenance of my diary, I take a well deserved holiday knowing that in three more days I will be eligible for a six month sabattical.\r\n\r\nJan 12th, 1995\r\nMy lecture this morning was a landmark effort. I launched into the explanation of the right-hand-rule, then, remembering that I was an academic, subverted myself into discussing of the right-hand-rule of hitch-hiking, the dangers of hitchhiking, the dangers of hitching in South America, my holiday in South America, the woman I met in South America, the place she worked at, their physics department, then to finish off, what their physics department said about the right-hand-rule. I think I was well received.\r\n\r\nJan 13th, 1995\r\nA minor peice of confusion here in that I brought my telephone book instead of my lecture notes. I improvised the basic electrical safety section of the course with the aid of two paper clips, a student and a handy power point. I feel sure the class now appreciates the dangers of electricity. Attendance dropped by one.\r\n\r\nJan 14th, 1995\r\nBeing a Friday, I decide to excite my first year pupils with an experiment in wave theory. I walked into the lab, waved, and left. I'm sure my students appreciated the humourous content.\r\n\r\nJan 16th, 1995\r\nHaving now mastered when weekends occur, I turned up to receive confirmation of my sabattical, taking it, on full pay, immediately.\r\n\r\nJul 17th, 1995\r\nBack from sabattical I realise that I did not make arrangements for a stand-in lecturer. In an attempt to catch up for the lost time, I set the students some homework, pages 1-375, read and do all exercises.\r\n\r\nJul 18th, 1995\r\nAttendance was exceptionally low today with only one student in class. When I asked him how his homework was going as his entire coursework depended on it. He screamed and left. I marked him absent and informed the grants department that no-one was attending my courses.\r\n\r\nJul 21st, 1995\r\nMy students are all back having received the letter informing them that grants are only paid to attending students. Scholarship students, with a far harsher attendance policy, are openly weeping.\r\n\r\nJul 24th, 1995\r\nI am now eligible for three months extra-curricular sabattical, which I decide to take immediately, warning my students that the exam will be held the day I return, covering all aspects of the course, including the last minute addition of the Encyclopedia Brittanica to the Book List. I expect all students to have a copy.\r\n\r\nOct 24th, 1995\r\nExam day.\r\nHaving no preparation time, I use last years exam and substitute different values for the equation. I randomly appoint a student from another class to work out the answers and mark the exams.\r\n\r\nOct 27th, 1995\r\nI receive the results of the exam which indicate that 89% of the class passed the exam. Lauded as an academic genius, I am awarded 6 months further paid sabbatical to study the effects of alcohol on the mind. Starting the third day of term next year. I think I'm on a winner here.",

There are two beakers at your desk, one of which holds the antidote. If the wrong substance is used, it causes instant death. You may begin as soon as the professor injects you with a sample of the poison. (We feel this will give you an incentive to find the correct answer.)\r\n\r\nCivil Engineering: This is a practical test of your design and building skills. With the boxes of toothpicks and glue present, build a platform that will support your weight when you and your platform are suspended over a vat of nitric acid.\r\n\r\nComputer Science: Write a fifth-generation computer language. Using this language, write a computer program to finish the rest of this exam for you.\r\n\r\nEconomics: Develop a realistic plan for refinancing the national debt. Trace the possible effects of your plan in the following areas: Cubism, the Donatist Controversy and the Wave Theory of Light. Outline a method for preventing these effects. Criticize this method from all possible points of view. Point out the deficiencies in your point of view, as demonstrated in your answer to the last question.\r\n\r\nElectrical Engineering: You will be placed in a nuclear reactor and given a partial copy of the electrical layout. The electrical system has been tampered with. You have seventeen minutes to find the problem and correct it before the reactor melts down.\r\n\r\nEngineering: The disassembled parts of a high-powered rifle have been placed on your desk. You will also find an instruction manual, printed in Swahili. In 10 minutes, a hungry bengal tiger will be admitted to the room. Take whatever action you feel necessary. Be prepared to justify your decision.\r\n\r\nEpistemology: Take a position for or against truth. Prove the validity of your stand.\r\n\r\nGeneral Knowledge: Describe in detail. Be objective and specific.\r\n\r\nHistory: Describe the history of the Papacy from its origins to the present day, concentrating especially, but not exclusively, on its Europe, Asia, America and Africa. Be brief, concise and specific.\r\n\r\nMathematics: Derive the Euler-Cauchy equations using only a straightedge and compass. Discuss in detail the role these equations had on mathematical analysis in Europe during the 1800s.\r\n\r\nMedicine: You have been provided with a razor blade, a piece of gauze, and a bottle of scotch. Remove your appendix. Do not suture until you work has been inspected. You have fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nMetaphysics: Describe in detail the probably nature of life after death. Test your hypothesis.\r\n\r\nMusic: Write a piano concerto. Orchestrate and perform it with flute and drum. You will find a piano under your seat.\r\n\r\nPhilosophy: Sketch the development of human thought. Estimate its significance. Compare with the development of any other kind of thought.\r\n\r\nPhyschology: Based on your knowledge of their works, evaluate the emotional stability, degree of adjustment, and repressed frustrations of each of the following: Alexander of Aphrodisis, Rameses II, Hammuarabi. Support your evaluation with quotations from each man's work, making appropriate references. It is not necessary to translate.\r\n\r\nPhysics: Explain the nature of matter. Include in your answer an evaluation of the impact of the development of mathematics on science.\r\n\r\nPolitical Science: There is a red telephone on the desk beside you. Start World War III. Report at length on its socio-political effects if any.\r\n\r\nPublic Speaking: 2500 riot-crazed aborigines are storming the classroom. Calm them. You may use any ancient language except Latin or Greek.\r\n\r\nReligion: Perform a miracle. Creativity will be judged.\r\n\r\nSociology: Estimate the sociological problems which might accompany the end of the world. Construct an experiment to test your theory.\r\n\r\nExtra Credit I: Define the universe, and give three examples.\r\n\r\nExtra Credit II: Rewrite the exam on parchment with a quill, and do all practical projects as if you lived in the Middle Ages.",

Now, as they stood in the forest, they had nothing with which to chop, they didn't know what to do at all, and they certainly didn't want to come home empty-handed. Finally one of them had the brilliant idea to pull the tree down; but as they hadn't brought a rope, one of them had to climb the tree and lay his head in the cleavage between two branches then the others were to pull his legs until the tree yielded. Very well, they pulled and they pulled, and eventually they all fell backwards, including the chap they had been pulling, only he had no head. This they couldn't fathom, they went searching and searching, but no, they didn't find the head, because it was stuck in the tree. Well, that couldn't be helped, now it was time to return home. And so they laid the headless man in the wagon and took him home to his wife and asked if she was sure that her husband had brought his head when he left home this morning. \"I can't remember that right now!\", said the wife; but then she thought for a while: \"Oh yes, he did bring his head!\" she said. \"He ate cabbage with it this morning before he left.\"",

Many flies were observed crawling across the Twinkie's surface, but contrary to hypothesis, birds, even pigeons, avoided this potential source of substance. Despite the rain and prolonged exposure to the sun, the Twinkie retained its original color and form. When removed, the Twinkie was found to be substantially dehydrated. Cracked open, it was observed to have taken on the consistency of industrial foam insulation; the filling however, retained its advertised \"creaminess\"\r\n\r\nRadiation\r\n\r\nA Twinkie was placed in a conventional microwave oven, which was set for precisely 4 minutes - the approximate cooking time of bacon. After 20 seconds, the oven began to emit the Twinkie's rich, characteristic aroma of artificial butter. After one minute, this aroma began to resemble the acrid smell of burning rubber. The experiment was aborted after 2 minutes 10 seconds when thick, foul smoke began billowing from the top of the oven. A second Twinkie was subjected to the same experiment; this Twinkie leaked molten white filling. When cooled, this now epoxylike filling bonded the Twinkie to its plate, defying gravity: it was removed only upon application of a butter knife. Extreme Force\r\n\r\nA Twinkie was dropped from a ninth-floor window, a fall of approximately 120 feet. It landed right side up, then bounced onto its back. The expected \"splatter\" effect was not observed. Indeed, the only discernible damage to the Twinkie was a narrow fissure on its underside; otherwise, the Twinkie remained structurally intact.\r\n\r\nExtreme Cold\r\n\r\nA Twinkie was placed in a conventional freezer for 24 hours. Upon removal, the Twinkie was not found to be frozen solid, but its physical properties had noticeably \"slowed\". The filling was found to be the approximate consistency of acrylic paint, while exhibiting the mercurylike property of not adhering to practically any surface. It was noticed the Twinkie had generously absorbed the freezer odors.\r\n\r\nExtreme Heat\r\n\r\nA Twinkie was exposed to a gas flame for 2 minutes. While the Twinkie smoked and blackened and the filling in one of its \"cream holes\" boiled, the Twinkie did not catch fire. It did, however produce the same \"burning rubber\" aroma noticed in the irradiation experiment.\r\n\r\nImmersion\r\n\r\nA Twinkie was dropped into a large bucket filled with water, the Twinkie floated momentarily, then began to list and sink. Viscous yellow tendrils ran off its lower half, possibly consisting of a water-soluble artificial coloring. After 2 hours, the Twinkie bloated substantially. Its coloring was now a very pale tan - in contrast to the yellow, urine-like water that surrounded it. The Twinkie bobbed when touched, and had a gelatinous texture. After 72 hours, the Twinkie had increased roughly 200 percent of its original size. The water had turned opaque, and a small, fan-shaped spray of filling had leaked from one of the \"cream holes\". Unfortunately, efforts to remove the Twinkie for further analysis were abandoned when, under light pressure the Twinkie disintegrated into an amorphous cloud of debris. A distinctly sour odor was noted.\r\n\r\nSummary of Results\r\n\r\nThe Twinkie's survival of a 120-foot drop, along with some of the unusual phenomena associated with the \"creamy filling\" and artificial coloring, should give pause to those observers who would unequivocally categorize the Twinkie as \"food\". Further clinical inquiry is required before any definite conclusions can be drawn.\r\n\r\nReprinted from SPY Magazine, July 1",

        "body": "\"One day a friend of mine called me up to tell me he was thinking of buying a computer. This guy is particularly sensitive to criticism and not exactly in the upper echelon of the IQ range, and personally I don't think he should own a programmable VCR much less a computer, but he's a good guy, so I said \"good for you.\" The following conversation ensued:\r\n\r\n    * Him: \"Well, I have a couple questions though, that I thought I should ask you, cause you know about those things, right?\"\r\n    * Me: \"Yeah, ok, what do you want to know?\"\r\n    * Him: \"Well . . . what one should I buy?\"\r\n    * Me: \"What do you want to do with it mostly? Play games, word processsing (blah blah blah) . . .?\"\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes later . . .\r\n\r\n    * Him: \"Well, I think probably I should get a real fast one, you know, cause I want it to go fast so I don't have to wait for the Internet.\"\r\n\r\nI proceed to explain, SLOWLY, about the difference between megahertz and modem speed, which takes another twenty minutes.\r\n\r\n    * Him: \"So how much is this going to cost me anyway?\"\r\n    * Me: \"It all depends on what you want. Some stuff costs more.\"\r\n\r\n(Now, let me say here that at the very beginning of all this I had stated that neither a monitor nor a printer would come with a computer itself, unless you went for a package deal. He was, at this point, saying that he wanted to spend about $500 and that everything had to be from the same manufacturer. This was when the 550 P3 had just come out, so prices were still higher than $500 for any system you could go buy in a Circuit City, which he said he HAD to do.)\r\n\r\n    * Him: \"Well, you know, I just want the basic stuff, a monitor, and a printer and a scanner, and maybe a camera, plus the stuff to make cards and print photos and all that, and the stuff to take care of paying my bills, and online.\"\r\n    * Me: \"Ok, well, you need to get a system first, then think about the extras. You really need to learn the basics first. A computer with a monitor and a printer is probably going to be a minimum of $800 to $1000, if you really want them all to be from the same company.\"\r\n    * Him: \"REALLY?! Well, ok, but I probably will need two printers, so it'll be more then, huh?\"\r\n    * Me: \"What?\"\r\n    * Him: \"Yeah, you can do that, right, hook up two of the same printer to one computer?\"\r\n    * Me: \"Well . . . NO, you can't.\"\r\n    * Him: \"But I'll need to do that!\"\r\n    * Me: \"No, really, you won't. Why do you think that?\"\r\n    * Him: \"Ok, wait, I know, what about two computers? Can you do that? Can you hook two computers together?\"\r\n    * Me: \"But . . . why? No.\"\r\n    * Him: \"But I am going to NEED that! You can't do that for me?!\"\r\n    * Me: \"Ok, ya know what, what the hell are you talking about?!? No one ever NEEDS to do what you are talking about doing so why do you think you need to do this?\"\r\n    * Him: \"Well, when I go to print out that manuscript I'm going to write, it'll probably be like 800 pages or so, so how am I ever going to get one printer to print that much, and one computer probably can't even hold that much in one thing, right?\"\r\n\r\nInside, I was going ballistic at this point, and it did boil over, especially since there is NO WAY there is 800 pages worth of anything in this guy's head, but I explained that (a) one computer can in fact \"hold\" that much and a whole lot more, and (b) one printer (unless it is a huge Xerox or other office type industrial machine) CAN'T hold that much paper in one shot.\r\n\r\nI hope that none of you nice tech support people never EVER get a call from this guy, because I guarantee you it will be the worst call you ever get in your life. You guys may all have to get together and dedicate a page to him, posting only his calls, just to vent your anger. He is the cupholder guy, the NOSMOKE.EXE guy, the guy who insists he \"hasn't changed anything\" when he really edited his AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS to include lines like \"and don't say I'm bad and an invalid,\" and the guy who has everything plugged in but nothing where it is supposed to be plugged in. He WILL have his powerstrip plugged into itself and will insist that it is NOT. May the force be with you all; you'll need it.\"",

If it is clear, check the vacuum pipes and hoses on the intake manifold and check all rounding wires. \r\n\r\nIf none of these approaches solves the problem, it could be that the fuel pump itself is faulty, causing low delivery pressure to the injectors.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps, John",

The discussion was so heated that even Braingle's debate forums could not equal it.

If they've already had one before, then their Wocka score is added to their Braingle score. Jake has made sure that the passwords of every Wocka and Braingle user match. If your Braingle and Wocka passwords are different, Jake will send you an email by tomorrow noon, Braingle time telling you what to do.\r\n2) All Wocka users with over 1000 marks now have an extra green karma arrow at Braingle.\r\n3) Wocka awards have been altered so that they differ from Braingle awards. The new set of awards have been transferred to your Braingle account.\r\n4) Wocka's joke database is yet to be transferred to Braingle, so you cannot view jokes there or look at your favourites yet.\r\n5) The Wocka forums will be merged into Braingle's soon.\r\n6) In order to match Braingle, subscription will be renamed to joke watchlist soon.\r\n7) Editors of Wocka are now Jokemasters of Braingle.\r\n8) Any Wocka user who actually thinks this message is serious loses ALL points on Braingle earned by taking the IQ test.",

I've never figured out why men think with their head and women with their heart.\r\n\r\nFOR EXAMPLE:\r\nOne evening last week, my girlfriend and I were getting into bed. Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says, \"I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.\" I said, \"WHAT??!!\r\n\r\nWhat was that?!\" So she says the words that every boyfriend on the planet dreads to hear . . . \"You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.\" She responded to my puzzled look by saying, \"Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?\"\r\n\r\nRealizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep. The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big un-named department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits.\r\n\r\nShe couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said, \"Let's get a pair for each outfit.\" We went on to the jewelery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings. Let me tell you . . . she was so excited.\r\n\r\nShe must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. I think I threw her for a loop when I said, \"That's fine, honey.\" She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation, she finally said, \"I think this is\r\nall dear, let's go to the cashier.\"\r\n\r\nI could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, \"No honey, I don't feel like it.\" Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, \"WHAT?\"\r\n \r\nI then said, \"Honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You're just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.\" Just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, \"Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?\"\r\n\r\nApparently I'm not having sex tonight either . . . but at least that girl knows I'm smarter than her.",

But instead of just turning a 180 and walking back in the direction from which you came, you have to first do something like check your watch or phone or make a grand arm gesture and mutter to yourself to ensure that no one in the surrounding area thinks you're crazy by randomly switching directions on the sidewalk. \r\n\r\nThat's enough, Nickelback.\r\n\r\nI totally take back all those times I didn't want to nap when I was younger.\r\n\r\nIs it just me, or are 80% of the people in the \"people you may know\" feature on Facebook people that I do know, but I deliberately choose not to be friends with?\r\n\r\nDo you remember when you were a kid, playing Nintendo and it wouldn't work? You take the cartridge out, blow in it and that would magically fix the problem. Every kid in America did that, but how did we all know how to fix the problem? There was no internet or message board or FAQ's. We just figured it out. Today's kids are soft.\r\n\r\nThere is a great need for sarcasm font.\r\n\r\nSometimes, I'll watch a movie that I watched when I was younger and suddenly realize I had no idea what the f was going on when I first saw it.\r\n\r\nHow the hell are you supposed to fold a fitted sheet?\r\n\r\nI would rather try to carry 10 plastic grocery bags in each hand than take 2 trips to bring my groceries in.\r\n\r\nI think part of a best friend's job should be to immediately clear your computer history if you die.\r\n\r\nThe only time I look forward to a red light is when I trying to finish a text.\r\n\r\nWas learning cursive really necessary?\r\n\r\nLOL has gone from meaning, \"laugh out loud\" to \"I have nothing else to say\".\r\n\r\nI have a hard time deciphering the fine line between boredom and hunger.\r\n\r\nWhenever someone says \"I'm not book smart, but I'm street smart\", all I hear is \"I'm not real smart, but I'm imaginary smart\".\r\n\r\nHow many times is it appropriate to say \"What?\" before you just nod and smile because you still didn't hear what they said?\r\n\r\nI love the sense of camaraderie when an entire line of cars teams up to prevent a dick from cutting in at the front. Stay strong, brothers!\r\n\r\nEvery time I have to spell a word over the phone using 'as in' examples, I will undoubtedly draw a blank and sound like a complete idiot. Today I had to spell my boss's last name to an attorney and said, \"Yes that's G as in...(10 second lapse)...ummm...Goonies.\"\r\n\r\nWhile driving yesterday I saw a banana peel in the road and instinctively swerved to avoid it...thanks Mario Kart.\r\n\r\nMapQuest really needs to start their directions on #5.

Don't mind if I do!\r\n\r\nWhy is it that during an ice-breaker, when the whole room has to go around and say their name and where they are from, I get so incredibly nervous? Like I know my name, I know where I'm from, this shouldn't be a problem.\r\n\r\nYou never know when it will strike, but there comes a moment at work when you've made up your mind that you just aren't doing anything productive for the rest of the day. \r\n\r\nCan we all just agree to ignore whatever comes after DVDs? I don't want to have to restart my collection.\r\n\r\nThere's no worse feeling than that millisecond you're sure you are going to die after leaning your chair back a little too far.\r\n\r\nI'm always slightly terrified when I exit out of Word and it asks me if I want to save any changes to my ten page research paper that I swear I did not make any changes to.\r\n\r\n\"Do not machine wash or tumble dry\" means I will never wash this ever.\r\n\r\nI hate when I just miss a call by the last ring (Hello? Hello? Damnit!), but when I immediately call back, it rings nine times and goes to voicemail. What'd you do after I didn't answer? Drop the phone and run away?\r\n\r\nI hate leaving my house confident and looking good and then not seeing anyone of importance the entire day. What a waste.\r\n\r\nWhen I meet a new person, I'm terrified of mentioning something they haven't already told me but that I have learned from some light internet stalking.\r\n\r\nI like all of the music in my iTunes, except when it's on shuffle, then I like about one in every fifteen songs in my iTunes.\r\n\r\nWhy is a school zone 20 mph? That seems like the optimal cruising speed for pedophiles...\r\n\r\nAs a driver I hate pedestrians, and as a pedestrian I hate drivers, but no matter what the mode of transportation, I always hate cyclists.\r\n\r\nI keep some people's phone numbers in my phone just so I know not to answer when they call.\r\n\r\nEven if I knew your social security number, I wouldn't know what do to with it.\r\n\r\nEven under ideal conditions people have trouble locating their car keys in a pocket, hitting the G-spot, and Pinning the Tail on the Donkey \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but I bet my ass everyone can find and push the Snooze button from 3 feet away, in about 1.7 seconds, eyes closed, first time every time...\r\n\r\nI think the freezer deserves a light as well.\r\n\r\nI disagree with Kay Jewelers. I would bet on any given Friday or Saturday night more kisses begin with Miller Lites than Kay.\r\n\r\nThe other night I ordered takeout, and when I looked in the bag, saw they had included four sets of plastic silverware. In other words, someone at the restaurant packed my order, took a second to think about it, and then estimated that there must be at least four people eating to require such a large amount of food. Too bad I was eating by myself. There's nothing like being made to feel like a fat %$#@! before dinner.",

''That one's even more expensive - $10,000! What does it do?'' ''Oh, that one's a C++ monkey; it can manage object-oriented programming, Visual C++, even some Java. All the really useful stuff,'' said the shopkeeper. The tourist looked around for a little longer and saw a third monkey in a cage of its own. The price tag around its neck read $50,000.

This had gone on for years and the Drids were sick of it.\r\n\r\nOne day a rabbi walked into the town and saw that all the people were unhappy. He went to a man and asked him what was wrong. The man replied, \"Our king takes all of our food and money and we hardly have anything. He lives wealthily while many of us starve.\"\r\n\r\nThe rabbi pondered thus for a minute and said to the man, \"Gather up all your people. I have an idea.\" Later that night, all the people were gathered in the town square. The man said to them, \"You guys need to stand up for yourselves. Have any of you actually tried to talk with this king?\" The townspeople all murmured. \"Well, one of you should talk to him tomorrow and demand he stops.\" One man stood up and said he would do it.\r\n\r\nThe next day the man and the rabbi went up to the king's castle which was up high on a hill. He said to the king, \"Please, oh great king, your people are starving and we have no money. Could you please spare us some of what we make?\" The king was infuriated; he kicked the man down the hill. The rabbi watched as the king did this. Later that night the rabbi had the same speech and said they need to bargain with the king. Another man volunteered.\r\n\r\nThe next day the man and the rabbi walked up the hill to the king. The man said to the king, \"Oh great king, would you please let us have some of our money and food back? We will double our crop and still give you most but could you spare us some?\" The king was even more infuriated and kicked the man down the hill. The rabbi was astonished. He gathered the townspeople in the center and declared that he would go talk to the king.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Rabbi walked up the hill by himself to the king. \"King!\" he roared. \"I have traveled far and wide and when I came to your town I saw that your people were unhappy. I have found out what you were doing to them. I am appalled! They are treated poorly and you must stop taking your people's food or they all will starve to death!\"\r\n\r\nThe king pondered this for a moment and said to the rabbi, \"I have heard what you have to say and I will stop stealing from my townspeople. I have enough wealth already, I guess I could spare them.\"\r\n\r\nThe rabbi had one more question for the king. \"Why do you kick your townpeople down the hill?\"\r\n\r\nThe king laughed and replied, \"Silly rabbi; kicks are for Drids.\"",

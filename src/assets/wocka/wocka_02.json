So he looked all around this small town he was in and found that the only place he could buy a faster means of transportation was at the local monastery. They had a horse for sale there for quite a deal. When the man was leaving the monastery with his new horse the monk that was sold him the horse said \"Now all you have to remember is- When you want the horse to move all you need to say is 'Hallelujah' and when you want it to stop say 'Amen.'\" The man then gave the monk a half acknowledged nod and continued on his way.\r\nAfter several miles the man sneezed and spooked the horse. The horse started running faster and faster. Then the man noticed a cliff ahead of him and stared to panic and said a prayer when the traveler said \"Amen\" the horse stopped right on the edge of the cliff. Then the man shouted and Praised God saying \"Hallelujah!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA certain man traveling ran into a stroke of bad luck. His horse died when he was still traveling, but luckily he was only a few miles off of a small town. He reached the town and inquired where he would be able to find a horse and he was told that the only person who had horses in the town was the preacher. The man went to the preacher and asked if he could buy a horse. The preacher said: \"Why certainly I'll sell this one right here to you. But remember this; I trained my horses to move when you say 'Praise the Lord' and when you want the horse to stop say 'Amen.'\"\r\nWith that the man thanked the preacher and said \"Praise the Lord!\" and the horse and the man immediately went riding away. While the man was riding along he noticed a cliff ahead of him and thought to himself \"What was it that the preacher told me to say to get this horse to stop?\" he then tried \"Whoa whoa, Betsy!\" but the horse kept on riding. The man finally so desperate said a prayer and at the end of his payer he said \"Amen.\" The horse stopped right at the edge of the cliff. The man looked down the steep cliff and said \"Praise the Lord!\"",

They advised that too many people were steering the boat, while not enough people were rowing. To prevent losing to the Japanese again next year, the rowing team's management structure was totally reorganized to 4 steering supervisors, 3 area steering superintendents and 1 assistant superintendent steering manager. They also implemented a new performance system that would give the 1 person rowing the boat greater incentive to work harder. It was called the Rowing Team\r\n Quality First Program, with meetings, dinners and a free pen for the rower.

Then ask for his card. Look at it for awhile, then give up and say you didn't like the trick anyway.\r\n\r\n12. Buy those bead kits where you make animals, santa claus, etc. Make them. Always carry at least one with you. Whenever you see a certain person, such as a roommate or sibling, whisper nasty gossip to the bead object, but not so loud as so the person can hear. Make sure to eye that person paranoidally.\r\n\r\n13.Buy 1 of every nightlight you can find. Say you are starting a collection. After 3 weeks, rip the decorative fronts, covers, or outsides of the nightlights. When someone asks, say you'll get back to him on that, then hastily throw them all away. Deny their existence and all knowledge you have of them.\r\n\r\n14. Fill a garbage bag full of leaves. Dump them in a pile on your roommate's bed. Play in it. Comment on the beautiful foliage.\r\n\r\n15.Ask someone why they hate you. Pretend you never asked.\r\n\r\n16. Right here! All purpose illogical things to say! Use them:\r\n\r\nTo answer a question\r\nSuddenly for no reason\r\nTo interrupt a conversation\r\nAnd to always, always pretend you never said it. So here we go!\r\n\r\n\"I got it! Suddenly it is so clear!\"\r\n\"You know, I always will regret doing that.\"\r\n\"When a Rubik's Cube is broken, and nobody is around to fix it, do I care?\"\r\n\"Fub!\"\r\n\"Nuk!\"\r\n\"Twee!\"\r\n\"Gan!\"\r\n\"Fireman Jellyfish.\"\r\n\"What? What? What? What? What? (etc.)\"\r\n\"I wonder what it's like to be a slice of cheese.\"\r\n\"Yes. I mean no. I mean... Maybe.\"(best used to answer questions that are NOT yes or no)\r\n\r\n17. Use the 'Confused Idiot' method. Say things that might seem in context, but obviously aren't.\r\n\r\n18. Buy a computer. Leave it on when you aren't using it. Turn it off when you are.\r\n\r\n19.Ask someone why the hell they ate your nachos, even though you ever had any nachos. Explain you will not leave him/her alone until he/she admits it. Follow that person everywhere. Always talk about the nachos. Guarranteed to make them admit or get a restraining order.",

It explodes. \r\nA king-size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2,000 sq ft house almost 4 inches deep. \r\nLegos will pass through the digestive tract of a 4-year-old. \r\nDuplos will not. \r\nPlay-Doh and microwave ovens should never be used in the same sentence. \r\nSuper Glue is forever. \r\nMacGyver can teach us many things we don't want to know. \r\nSo can Tarzan. \r\nNo matter how much Jell-O you put in the pool, you still can't walk on water. \r\nPool filters do not like Jell-O. \r\nVCRs do not eject PB&J sandwiches, even though TV commercials show they do. \r\nGarbage bags do not make good parachutes. \r\nMarbles in gas tanks make lots of noise when driving. \r\nYou probably don't want to know what that odor is. \r\nAlways look in the oven before you turn it on. \r\nPlastic toys do not like ovens. \r\nThe fire department in San Diego has at least a 5-minute response. \r\nThe spin cycle on the washing machine does not make earthworms dizzy. \r\nIt will, however, make cats dizzy. \r\nCats throw up twice their body weight when dizzy. \r\nA good sense of humor will get you through most problems in life.",

The deceased male was dressed in a full wet suit, complete with scuba tanks on his back, flippers, and face mask.\r\n\r\nA postmortem test revealed that the man died not from burns, but from massive internal injuries. Dental records provided a positive identification. Investigators then set about to determine how a fully clothed diver ended up in the middle of a forest fire.\r\n\r\nIt was revealed that on the day of the fire, the man went diving off the coast, some 20 miles from the forest. The fire fighters, seeking to control the fire as quickly as possible, had called in a fleet of helicopters with very large dip buckets. Water was dipped from the ocean and emptied at the site of the forest fire.\r\n\r\nYou guessed it. One minute our diver was making like Flipper in the Pacific, the next, he was doing the breast stroke in a fire dip bucket 300 feet in the air. Some days it just doesn't pay to get out of bed.\r\n___________________________________________\r\n\r\nStill think you're having a bad day?\r\n\r\nA man was working on his motorcycle on the patio, his wife nearby in the kitchen. While racing the engine, the motorcycle accidentally slipped into gear. The man, still holding onto the handlebars, was dragged along as it burst through the glass patio doors.\r\n\r\nHis wife, hearing the crash, ran in the room to find her husband cut and bleeding, the motorcycle, and the shattered patio door. She called for an ambulance and, because the house sat on a fairly large hill, went down the several flights of stairs to meet the paramedics and escort them to her husband.\r\n\r\nWhile the attendants were loading her husband, the wife managed to right the motorcycle and push it outside. She also quickly blotted up the spilled gasoline with some paper towels and tossed them into the toilet.\r\n\r\nAfter being treated and released, the man returned home, looked at the shattered patio door and the damage done to his motorcycle. He went into the bathroom and consoled himself with a cigarette while attending to his business. About to stand, he flipped the butt between his legs.\r\n\r\nThe wife, who was in the kitchen, heard a loud explosion and her husband screaming. Finding him lying on the bathroom floor with his trousers blown away and burns on his buttocks, legs and groin, she\r\nonce again phoned for an ambulance. The same paramedic crew was dispatched.\r\n\r\nAs the paramedics carried the man down the stairs to the ambulance they asked the wife how he had come to burn himself. She told them.\r\nThey started laughing so hard, one slipped, the stretcher and dumping the husband out. He fell down the remaining stairs, breaking his arm.\r\n______________________________________________\r\nStill having a bad day? Just remember, it could be worse...\r\n\r\nThe average cost of rehabilitating a seal after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska was $80,000. At a special ceremony, two of the most expensively saved animals were being released back into the wild amid cheers and applause from onlookers. A minute later, in full view, a killer whale ate them both.\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nStill think you are having a bad day?\r\n\r\nA woman came home to find her husband in the kitchen shaking frantically, almost in a dancing frenzy, with some kind of wire running from his waist towards the electric kettle. Intending to jolt him away from the deadly current, she whacked him with a handy\r\nplank of wood, breaking his arm in two places. Up to that moment, he had been happily listening to his Walkman.\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nSTILL think you're having a bad day?\r\n\r\nTwo animal rights protesters were protesting at the cruelty of sending pigs to a slaughterhouse in Bonn, Germany. Suddenly, all two thousand pigs broke loose and escaped through a broken fence, stampeding madly The two hopeless protesters were trampled to death.\r\n____________________________________________\r\n\r\nWhat?!

On this mountain lived a Giant. The Giant did not allow Trids on his mountain. If a Trid dared to climb onto the mountain, the Giant would kick him into the ocean. Trids are notoriously bad swimmers, and frequently drowned when kicked into the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe Trids were a very sexual people, and the population had grown quite large. Every square inch of the island, except the mountain, was crowded with Trids.\r\n\r\nThe Trids spent their days crowded together, dreaming of the open space available on the ever visible mountain. Every few days, a Trid would decide he couldn't stand the crowds any more. He would start to climb the mountain, and the Giant would kick the Trid into the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe Trids were a very depressed people.\r\n\r\nOne day a traveling Rabbi visited the Island of Trid. Despite their overcrowded conditions, the Trids were extremely generous to this man of God.\r\n\r\nThe Rabbi decided to return the favor, and to go plead the Trid's case to the Giant. \"Surely the Giant can be convinced to share some of the mountain with you,\" the Rabbi explained.\r\n\r\nThe Trids were horrified. \"Please don't go, Rabbi\", the Trids implored. \"The Giant will kick you into the ocean, and you will surely drown.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rabbi was stubborn, and insisted that he talk to the Giant. The Trids sent out every boat they had. They formed a ring around the island, so that they would be able to rescue the Rabbi.\r\n\r\nThe Rabbi started walking towards the mountain. No sign of the Giant.\r\n\r\nHe walked through the foothills, and there was no sign of the Giant.\r\n\r\nHe started up the slopes of the mountain, further than any Trid had ever been. Still no sign of the Giant.\r\n\r\nFinally he reached the summit of the mountain. There the Giant was waiting for him. The Rabbi asked \"Tell me Giant, why have you allowed me to climb to the top of the mountain, without kicking me off the moment I started climbing?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Giant replied, \"Silly Rabbi, kicks are for Trids!\"",

Therefore, a program to phase out older personnel by the end of the current fiscal year, via retirement, will be placed into effect immediately.\r\n\r\nThis program will be known as SLAP (Sever Late-Aged Personnel). Employees who are SLAPPED will be given the opportunity to look for jobs outside the company.\r\n\r\nSLAPPED employees can request a review of their employment records before actual retirement takes place. This review phase of the program is called SCREW.\r\n\r\nSCREW (Survey of Capabilities of Retired Early Workers). All employees who have been SLAPPED and SCREWED may file an appeal with upper management.\r\n\r\nThis appeal is called SHAFT (Study by Higher Authority Following Termination).\r\n\r\nUnder the terms of the new policy, an employee may be SLAPPED once, SCREWED twice, but may be SHAFTED as many times as the company deems appropriate.\r\n\r\nIf an employee follows the above procedure, he/she will be entitled to get: HERPES (Half Earnings for Retired Personnel's Early Severance) or CLAP (Combined Lump sum Assistance Payment).\r\n\r\nAs HERPES and CLAP are considered benefit plans, any employee who has received HERPES or CLAP will no longer be SLAPPED or SCREWED by the company.\r\n\r\nManagement wishes to assure the younger employees who remain on board that the company will continue its policy of training employees through our:\r\n\r\nSpecial High Intensity Training (SHIT). We take pride in the amount of SHIT our employees receive. We have given our employees more SHIT than any company in this area. If any employee feels they do not receive enough SHIT on the job, see your immediate supervisor.\r\n\r\nYour supervisor is specially trained to make sure you receive all the SHIT you can stand.\r\n\r\nAnd, once again, thanks for all your years of service with us.",

We don't have a life, and we find it deeply moving to catch a fleeting glimpse of yours.\r\n\r\nDon't write anything down. Ever. We can play back the error messages from here.\r\n\r\nWhen an I.T. person says he's coming right over, go for coffee. That way you won't be there when we need your password. It's nothing for us to remember 700 screen saver passwords.\r\n\r\nWhen you call the help desk, state what you want, not what's keeping you from getting it. We don't need to know that you can't get into your mail because your computer won't power on at all.\r\n\r\nWhen I.T. support sends you an E-Mail with high importance, delete it at once. We're just testing.\r\n\r\nWhen an I.T. person is eating lunch at his desk, walk right in and spill your guts right out. We exist only to serve.\r\n\r\nSend urgent email all in uppercase. The mail server picks it up and flags it as a rush delivery.\r\n\r\nWhen the photocopier doesn't work, call computer support. There's electronics in it.\r\n\r\nWhen something's wrong with your home PC, dump it on an I.T. person's chair with no name, no phone number and no description of the problem. We love a puzzle.\r\n\r\nWhen an I.T. person tells you that computer screens don't have cartridges in them, argue. We love a good argument.\r\n\r\nWhen an I.T. person tells you that he'll be there shortly, reply in a scathing tone of voice: \"And just how many weeks do you mean by shortly?\" That motivates us.\r\n\r\nWhen the printer won't print, re-send the job at least 20 times. Print jobs frequently get sucked into black holes.\r\n\r\nWhen the printer still won't print after 20 tries, send the job to all 68 printers in the company. One of them is bound to work.\r\n\r\nDon't learn the proper term for anything technical. We know exactly what you mean by \"My thingy blew up\".\r\n\r\nDon't use on-line help.

        "body": "THE NBA PLAYER ADOPTION PROGRAM NEEDS YOU!\r\n\r\nWith an NBA player's strike against the team owners looming, now is the time for us to show the world just how much we care. It's just not right. Hundreds of basketball players in our very own country are living at or just below the seven-figure salary level! Atrocious! And, as if that weren't bad enough, they will be deprived of pay for several weeks - possibly a whole year - as a result of the strike. But now you can help! For about two thousand dollars a day - that's less than the cost of a large screen projection TV - you can help a basketball player remain economically viable during his time of need.\r\n\r\nTwo thousand dollars a day may not seem like a lot of money to you, but to a basketball player it could mean the difference between a vacation spent golfing in Florida or a Mediterranean cruise. For you, two thousand dollars is nothing more than three months rent or mortgage payments, but to a basketball player, two thousand dollars a day will almost replace his salary.\r\n\r\nYour commitment of two thousand dollars a day will enable a player to buy that home entertainment center, trade in the year-old Lexus for a new Ferrari, or enjoy a weekend in Rio.\r\n\r\n\"HOW WILL I KNOW I'M HELPING?\"\r\n\r\nEach month, you will receive a complete financial report on the player you sponsor. Detailed information about his stocks, bonds, 401(k), real estate, and other investment holdings will be mailed to your home. You'll also get information on how he plans to invest the $5 million lump sum he will receive upon retirement. Plus upon signing up for this program, you will receive a photo of the player (unsigned). Put the photo on your refrigerator to remind you of other peoples' suffering.\r\n\r\n\"HOW WILL HE KNOW I'M HELPING\"\r\n\r\nYour basketball player will be told that he has a SPECIAL FRIEND who just wants to help in a time of need. Although the player won't know your name, he will be able to make collect calls to your home via a special operator just in case additional funds are needed for unexpected expenses.\r\n\r\nSimply fill out the form below.\r\n\r\n___YES, I want to help!\r\n\r\nI would like to sponsor a striking NBA basketball player. My preference is checked below:\r\n\r\n[ ] Starter\r\n[ ] Reserve\r\n[ ] Star*\r\n[ ] Superstar**\r\n[ ] Entire team***\r\n[ ] I'll sponsor a player most in\r\n    need. Please select one for me.\r\n\r\n*    Higher cost\r\n**   Much higher cost\r\n***  Please call our 900 number to\r\n     ask for the cost of a specific\r\n     team (Sorry, does not include\r\n     cheerleaders).\r\n\r\nPlease charge the account listed below $2,054.79 per day for a reserve player or starter for the duration of the strike. Please send me a picture of the player I have sponsored, along with a team logo and my very own NBA Players Association badge to wear proudly on my lapel.\r\n\r\n[ ] MasterCard       [ ] Visa\r\n[ ] American Express [ ] DiscoverCard\r\n[ ] Diner's Club \r\n\r\nYour Name: __________________________\r\nTelephone Number:  __________________\r\nAccount Number: _____________________\r\nExp.Date:____________________________\r\nSignature:  _________________________\r\n\r\nMail completed form to NBA Players Association or call 1-888-TOOMUCH now to enroll by phone. (Children under 18 must have parental approval.)\r\n\r\nNote: Sponsors are not permitted to contact the player they have sponsored, either in person or by other means including, but not limited to, telephone calls, letters, e-mail, or third parties. Keep in mind that the basketball player you have sponsored will be much too busy enjoying his free time, thanks to your generous donations. Oh, yes, contributions are not tax-deductible.",

On the last Friday of Lent, the neighborhood men got together and decided that something had to be done about John. He was tempting them to eat meat each Friday of Lent, and they couldn't take it anymore.\r\n\r\nThey decided to try and convert John to Catholicism.\r\n\r\nThey went over and talked to him. John decided to join all of his neighbors and become a Catholic, which made them all very happy.\r\n\r\nThey took him to church, and the priest sprinkled some water over him, and said, \"You were born a Baptist, you were raised a Baptist, and now you are a Catholic.\"\r\n\r\nThe men were so relieved, now their biggest Lenten temptation was resolved.\r\n\r\nThe next year's Lenten season rolled around. The first Friday of Lent came, and, just at supper time, when the neighborhood was settling down to their cold tuna fish dinner, the smell of steak cooking on a grill came wafting into their homes. The neighborhood men could not believe their noses! WHAT WAS GOING ON?\r\n\r\nThey called each other up and decided to meet over in John's yard to see if he had forgotten it was the first Friday of Lent. The group arrived just in time to see John standing over his grill with a small pitcher of water. He was sprinkling some water over his steak on the grill, saying, \"You were born a cow, you were raised a cow, and now you are a fish.\"",

Sure enough, five minutes later, the Pope walked through the door and shook my hand, I knelt down and he spoke a few words to me.\" \"Oh, really!

I repeat, the chicken did NOT cross the road.\r\n\r\nMachiavelli: The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who cares why? The end of crossing the road justifies whatever motive there was.\r\n\r\nBill Gates: I have just released the new Chicken Office 2000, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook.\r\n\r\nOliver Stone: The question is not, \"Why did the chicken cross the road?\" Rather, it is, \"Who was crossing the road at the same time, whom we overlooked in our haste to observe the chicken crossing?\"\r\n\r\nPlato: For the greater good of man. \r\n\r\nKarl Marx: It was a historical inevitability.\r\n\r\nOsama Bin Laden: The chicken knew nothing of its mission (ha, ha, ha) only that it would be a martyr. \r\n\r\nRonald Reagan: I forget.\r\n\r\nCaptain James T.

I was feeling particularly sassy that day because I had just come from a thrilling choir performance, followed by a thunderous prayer meeting, so I bought the sticker and put it on my bumper.\r\n\r\nBoy, I'm glad I did! What an uplifting experience followed! \r\n\r\nI was stopped at a red light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord and how good He is...and I didn't notice that the light had changed. It is a good thing someone else loves Jesus because if he hadn't honked, I'd never have noticed! I found that LOTS of people love Jesus!\r\n\r\nWhile I was sitting there, the guy behind started honking like crazy, and then he leaned out of his window and screamed, \"For the love of GOD! GO! GO! Jesus Christ, GO!\" \r\n\r\nWhat an exuberant cheerleader he was for Jesus! Everyone started honking! I just leaned out of my window and started waving and smiling at all these loving people. I even honked my horn a few times to share in the love!\r\n\r\nThere must have been a man from Florida back there because I heard him yelling something about a \"sunny beach\"... I saw another guy waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. I asked my teenage grandson in the back seat what that meant, he said that it was probably a Hawaiian good luck sign or something.\r\n\r\nWell, I've never met anyone from Hawaii, so I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back. My grandson burst out laughing ... he was enjoying this religious experience, too! \r\n\r\nA couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started walking towards me. I bet they wanted to pray or ask what church I attended, but this is when I noticed the light had changed. So, I waved to all my sisters and brothers grinning, and drove on through the intersection.\r\n\r\nI noticed I was the only car that got through the intersection before the light changed again and I felt kind of sad that had to leave them after all the love we had shared, so I slowed the car down, leaned out of the window and gave them all the Hawaiian good luck sign one last time as I drove away. \r\n\r\nPraise the Lord for such wonderful folks! \r\n\r\nLove,\r\nGrandma",

        "body": "It is important for men to remember, that as women grow older it becomes harder for them to maintain t he same quality of housekeeping as when they were younger. When you notice this, try not to yell at them. Some are oversensitive and there ain't nothing worse then an oversensitive woman. \r\nMy name is Doug .... Let me relate how I handled the situation with my wife, Ernestine. \r\n\r\nWhen I was laid off from my consulting job and took \"early retirement\" in April, it became necessary for Ernestine to get a full-time job, both for extra income and for the health benefits that we needed. \r\n\r\nShortly after she started working I noticed she was beginning to show her age. I usually get home from the Golf Course about the same time she gets home from work. Although she knows how hungry I am, she almost always says she has to rest for half an hour or so before she starts dinner. I don't yell at her. Instead, I tell her to take her time and just wake me when she gets dinner on the table. I generally have lunch in the Men's Grill at the club so eating out is not reasonable. I'm ready for some home cooked grub when I hit that door... \r\n\r\nShe used to do the dishes as soon as we finished eating. But now, it's not unusual for them to sit on the table for several hours after dinner. I do what I can by diplomatically reminding her several times each evening that they won't clean themselves. I know she appreciates this, as it does seem to motivate her to get them done before she goes to bed. \r\n\r\nI really think my old business as a consultant helps a lot. I consider telling people what they ought to do one of my strong points... \r\n\r\nAnd speaking of bed, her age really shows up there. I go out and golf all day, come in dead tired and after a two hour nap and a good meal, I'm ready, if you know what I mean. Age has gotten her so bad that she actually dozes off during lovemaking. But that's okay. Her satisfaction in that area is important to a sensitive guy like me and if she enjoys sleeping during our little trysts, what the hey... \r\n\r\nNow that she has gotten older, she does seem to get tired so much more quickly. Our washer and dryer are in the basement. Sometimes she says she just can't make another trip down those steps. I don't make a big issue of this; as she finishes up the laundry the next evening, I'm willing to overlook it. \r\n\r\nNot only that, but unless I need something ironed to wear to the Monday lodge meeting, or to Wednesday's or Saturday's poker club, or to Tuesday's or Thursday's bowling, or something like that, I will tell her to wait until the next evening to do the ironing. This gives her a little more time to do some of those odds and ends like shampooing the dog, vacuuming or dusting... \r\n\r\nAlso, if I had a really good day on the course and it was wet and muddy my clubs are a mess, so I let her clean them, you know..... get the grit off the grips and a little light Brillo on the club faces at a casual pace. My golf bag is heavy so I lift it out of the trunk for her. Women are delicate, have weak wrists and can't lift heavy stuff as good as men. But I did tell her I don't like to be wakened during my after golf nap, so rather then bother me, she can put them back in the trunk when she's finished. \r\n\r\nAnother symptom of aging is complaining, I think. For example, she will say that it is difficult for her to find t ime to pay the monthly bills during her lunch hour. But boys, we take em for better or worse, so I just smile and offer encouragement. I tell her to stretch it out over two or even three days. That way she won't have to rush so much. I also remind her that missing lunch completely now and then wouldn't hurt her any (if you know what I mean). I like to think tact is one of my strong points. \r\n\r\nWhen doing simple jobs, she seems to think she needs more rest periods. She had to take a break when she was only half finished mowing the yard. I try not to make a scene. I'm a fair man. I tell her to fix herself a nice, big, cold glass of freshly squeezed lemonade and just sit for a while. And, as long as she is making one for herself, she may as well make one for me too, then take her break by my hammock. That way she can talk with me until I fall asleep. \r\n\r\nI know that I probably look like a saint in the way I support Ernestine. I'm not saying that showing this much consideration is easy. Many men will find it difficult. Some will find it impossible. Nobody knows better than I do, how frustrating women get as they get older. \r\n\r\nHowever, guys, even if you just use a little more tact and less criticism of your aging wife because of this article, I will consider that writing it was well worthwhile. After all, we are put on this earth to help each other... \r\n\r\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Doug died suddenly Thursday, January 3. He was found with a Calloway extra long 50 inch Big Bertha Driver rammed up his rectum with only 2 inches of grip showing. His wife Ernestine was arrested, but the Grand Jury accepted her defence that he accidentally sat on it and she was released on Friday, January 4th.",

Pictures will be taken next Wednesday and employees will receive their cards in two weeks.\" (This was the winning quote from Fred Dales at Microsoft Corp. in Redmond, WA.)\r\n\r\n2. \"What I need is a list of specific unknown problems we will encounter.\" (Lykes Lines Shipping)\r\n\r\n3. \"E-mail is not to be used to pass on information or data. It should be used only for company business.\" (Accounting manager, Electric Boat Company)\r\n\r\n4. \"This project is so important, we can't let things that are more important interfere with it.\" (Advertising/Marketing manager, United Parcel Service)\r\n\r\n5. \"Doing it right is no excuse for not meeting the schedule.\"\r\n\r\n6. \"No one will believe you solved this problem in one day! We've been working on it for months. Now, go act busy for a few weeks and I'll let you know when it's time to tell them.\" (R&D supervisor, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing/3M Corp.)\r\n\r\n7. \"My Boss spent the entire weekend retyping a 25-page proposal that only needed corrections. She claims the disk I gave her was damaged and she couldn't edit it. The disk I gave her was write-protected.\" (CIO of Dell Computers)\r\n\r\n8. Quote from the Boss: \"Teamwork is a lot of people doing what I say.\" (Marketing executive, Citrix Corporation)\r\n\r\n9. My sister passed away and her funeral was scheduled for Monday. When I told my boss, he said she died on purpose so that I would have to miss work on the busiest day of the year. He then asked if we could change her burial to Friday. He said, \"That would be better for me.\" (Shipping executive, FTD Florists)\r\n\r\n10. \"We know that communication is a problem, but the company is not going to discuss it with the employees.\" (Switching supervisor, AT&T Long Lines Division)\r\n\r\n11. We recently received a memo from senior management saying: \"This is to inform you that a memo will be issued today regarding the memo mentioned above.\" (Microsoft, Legal Affairs Division)\r\n\r\n12. One day my boss asked me to submit a status report to him concerning a project I was working on. I asked him if tomorrow would be soon enough. He said, \"If I wanted it tomorrow, I would have waited until tomorrow to ask for it!\" (New business manager, Hallmark Greeting Cards) \r\n\r\n13. As director of communications, I was asked to prepare a memo reviewing our company's training programs and materials. In the body of the memo in one of the sentences I mentioned the \"pedagogical approach\" used by one of the training manuals. The day after I routed the memo to the executive committee, I was called into the HR director's office, and told that the executive vice president wanted me out of the building by lunch. When I asked why, I was told that she wouldn't stand for perverts (paedophiles?) working in her company. Finally, he showed me her copy of the memo, with her demand that I be fired \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the word \"pedagogical\" circled in red. The HR manager was fairly reasonable, and once he looked the word up in his dictionary and made a copy of the definition to send back to her, he told me not to worry. He would take care of it. Two days later, a memo to the entire staff came out directing us that no words, which could not be found in the local Sunday newspaper could be used in company memos. A month later, I resigned, and in accordance with company policy, I created my resignation memo by pasting words together from the Sunday paper. (Taco Bell Corporation)",

        "body": "Memorize these definitions and pooping at work will become a pure pleasure.\r\n\r\nESCAPEE: A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing poop in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of panic/embarrassment. This is similar to the hot flash you receive when passing an unseen police car & speeding. If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you are standing next to the farter at the urinal, pretend that you did not hear it. No one likes an escapee, it is uncomfortable for all involved. Making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel uneasy.\r\n\r\nJAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with escapee): When forcing a poop, several farts slip out at a machine gun's pace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should happen do not panic, remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.\r\n\r\nCOURTESY FLUSH: The act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of the poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed location. This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom. This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME.\r\n\r\nWALK OF SHAME: Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you have just stunk-up the shitter. This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks in and busts you. As with all farts, it is best to pretend that the smell does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of a COURTESY FLUSH.\r\n\r\nOUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER: A colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it. You will often see an Out of the Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with a newspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look around the office for the Out OF THE CLOSET POOPER before entering the bathroom.\r\n\r\nTHE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN): This is a group of coworkers who band together to ensure emergency pooping goes off without incident. This group can help you to monitor the whereabouts of OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPERS and identify SAFE HAVENS.\r\n\r\nSAFE HAVEN: A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom.\r\n\r\nTURD BURGLAR: A pooper who does not realize that you're in the stall and tries to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments that occur when taking a dump at work. If this occurs, remain in the stall until the TURD BURGLAR leaves. This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact. TURD BURGLARS have been know to cause premature pinchage, which inevitably causes you to pinch one off in the middle.\r\n\r\nCAMO-COUGH: A phony cough which alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON or to alert potential TURD BURGLARS. Very effective when used in conjunction with an ASTAIRE.\r\n\r\nASTAIRE: This is a subtle toe-tap that is used to alert all potential TURD BURGLARS that you are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that the stall is occupied. If you hear an ASTAIRE, leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace.\r\n\r\nWATERMELON: A turd that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water. This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a WATERMELON coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH.\r\n\r\nHAVANA OMELET: A load of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water. Often accompanied by an escapee. Try using a CAMO-COUGH with an ASTAIRE.\r\n\r\nUNCLE TED: A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever. Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot. An UNCLE TED makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, as you should always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees.\r\n\r\nFLY BY: The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in, check for other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and come back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER. People may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.",

        "body": "THE COMMON FART \r\n\r\nThe Common Fart is the fart heard most often. It is a very close relative of the \"Ripper\", but is released with less force. It is usually heard in groups where people aren't yet comfortable with farting amongst each other. Therefore, one person in the group gets up some nerve and releases this common-sounding fart in such a manner that everyone now feels comfortable with group flatulence.. Usually there is no smell with the Common Fart. \r\n\r\nTHE ANXIOUS FART \r\n\r\nThe Anxious Fart is let in a place where someone does not want the fart to be heard. \r\nYou may have seen men and women in book stores or grocery stores, or even on the street, letting these farts. \r\nThey are generally controlled, usually barely audible, and require much skill to master. \r\n\r\nTHE COUGHING FART \r\n\r\nThe Coughing Fart is one that the farter tries to cover up with a cough. My dad used to let these farts all the time when he worked at the Bingo Hall. He would stand at the back of the hall and cough, just as a nice \"common fart\" was let. It can be embarrassing for the farter, and those around the farter, if the timing is off at all, or if the fart is longer than anticipated. \r\n\r\nTHE WET FART \r\n\r\nThe Wet Fart is one that sounds quite juicy. Quite often this fart is cause for alarm, \r\nand an indication that a trip to the toilet is imminent.\r\n\r\nTHE BLOWER \r\n\r\nThis fart is similar to the ripper, except it has a bit of a hollow, windy sound to it. \r\nThis is due to farter blowing all the gas out quickly. This fart will almost always get a laugh. \r\n\r\nTIGHT BUN FART \r\n\r\nThis fart is always recognizable. It sounds like the farter's \r\nbuns were so tight that he/she was in pain while farting. \r\n\r\nTHE RIPPER\r\n\r\nOne of the best farts around is The Ripper. It is loud, rough, and always raises an eyebrow or two. Characteristics of The Ripper often show up in other farts, but make no mistake - \r\nthis fart is a single, powerful gas-bubble that comes screaming from the farter's butt",

Sir Isaac Newton called this sudden termination of motion the stooge's surcease.\r\n\r\nCartoon Law III Any body passing through solid matter will leave a perforation conforming to its perimeter.\r\nAlso called the silhouette of passage, this phenomenon is the speciality of victims of directed-pressure explosions and of reckless cowards who are so eager to escape that they exit directly through the wall of a house, leaving a cookie-cutout-perfect hole. The threat of skunks or matrimony often catalyzes this reaction.\r\n\r\nCartoon Law IV The time required for an object to fall twenty stories is greater than or equal to the time it takes for whoever knocked it off the ledge to spiral down twenty flights to attempt to capture it unbroken.\r\nSuch an object is inevitably priceless, the attempt to capture it inevitably unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nCartoon Law V All principles of gravity are negated by fear.\r\nPsychic forces are sufficient in most bodies for a shock to propel them directly away from the earth's surface. A spooky noise or an adversary's signature sound will induce motion upward, usually to the cradle of a chandelier, a treetop, or the crest of a flagpole. The feet of a character who is running or the wheels of a speeding auto need never touch the ground, especially when in flight.\r\n\r\nCartoon Law VI As speed increases, objects can be in several places at once.\r\nThis is particularly true of tooth-and-claw fights, in which a character's head may be glimpsed emerging from the cloud of altercation at several places simultaneously. This effect is common as well among bodies that are spinning or being throttled.\r\nA wacky character has the option of self-replication only at manic high speeds and may ricochet off walls to achieve the velocity required.\r\n\r\nCartoon Law VII Certain bodies can pass through solid walls painted to resemble tunnel entrances; others cannot.\r\nThis trompe l'oeil inconsistency has baffled generations, but at least it is known that whoever paints an entrance on a wall's surface to trick an opponent will be unable to pursue him into this theoretical space.\r\nThe painter is flattened against the wall when he attempts to follow into the painting. This is ultimately a problem of art, not of science.\r\n\r\nCartoon Law VIII Any violent rearrangement of feline matter is impermanent.\r\nCartoon cats possess even more deaths than the traditional nine lives might comfortably afford. They can be decimated, spliced, splayed, accordion-pleated, spindled, or disassembled, but they cannot be destroyed. After a few moments of blinking self pity, they reinflate, elongate, snap back, or solidify.\r\nCorollary: A cat will assume the shape of its container.\r\n\r\nCartoon Law IX Everything falls faster than an anvil.\r\n\r\nCartoon Law X For every vengeance there is an equal and opposite revengeance.\r\nThis is the one law of animated cartoon motion that also applies to the physical world at large. For that reason, we need the relief of watching it happen to a duck instead.\r\n\r\nCartoon Law Amendment A A sharp object will always propel a character upward.\r\nWhen poked (usually in the buttocks) with a sharp object (usually a pin), a character will defy gravity by shooting straight up, with great velocity.\r\n\r\nCartoon Law Amendment B The laws of object permanence are nullified for \"cool\" characters.\r\nCharacters who are intended to be \"cool\" can make previously nonexistent objects appear from behind their backs at will. For instance, the Road Runner can materialize signs to express himself without speaking.\r\n\r\nCartoon Law Amendment C Explosive weapons cannot cause fatal injuries.\r\nThey merely turn characters temporarily black and smokey.",

If a student does not successfully FART by grade 5, that student shall be placed in a separate English program, the Special Mastery Elective for Learning Language (SMELL).\r\n\r\nIf with this increased SMELL program the student cannot pass the required FART test, he or she can graduate to middle school by taking a one-semester course in Comprehensive Reading and Arithmetic Preparation (CRAP).\r\n\r\nIf by age fourteen, the student cannot FART, SMELL, or CRAP,he will earn his promotion in an intensive one-week seminar. This is the Preparatory Reading for Unprepared Nationally Exempted Students (PRUNES).\r\n\r\nIt is the opinion of the Florida Department of Public Instruction (DPI) that an intensive week of PRUNES will enable any student to FART, SMELL, or CRAP. \r\nThis revised provision of the student-testing component of House Bill 110 should help clear the air.\r\n\r\nThis is part of the: \"No School Left Standing Act\".",

If the thing has been misplaced, I'll miss a whole show looking for it, though one time I was able to survive by holding a calculator.\r\n\r\nBecause I'm a guy, when I lock my keys in the car I will fiddle with a wire clothes hanger and ignore your suggestions that we call a road service until long after hypothermia has set in.\r\n\r\nOh, and when the car isn't running very well, I will pop the hood and stare at the engine as if I know what I'm looking at. If another guy shows up, one of us will say to the other, \"I used to be able to fix these things, but now with all these computers and everything, I wouldn't know where to start.\" We will then drink beer.\r\n\r\nBecause I'm a guy, when I catch a cold I need someone to bring me soup and take care of me while I lie in bed and moan. You never get as sick as I do, so for you this isn't an issue.\r\n\r\nBecause I'm a guy, I can be relied upon to purchase basic groceries at the store, like milk or bread. I cannot be expected to find exotic items like \"cumin\" or \"tofu.\" For all I know these are the same thing. And never, under any circumstances, expect me to pick up anything for which \"feminine hygiene product\" is a euphemism.\r\n\r\nBecause I'm a guy, when one of our appliances stops working I will insist on taking it apart -- despite evidence that this will just cost me twice as much once the repair person gets here and has to put it back together.\r\n\r\nBecause I'm a guy, I don't think we're all that lost, and no, I don't think we should stop and ask someone. Why would you listen to a complete stranger -- how the heck could HE know where we're going?\r\n\r\nBecause I'm a guy, there is no need to ask me what I'm thinking about. The answer is always either sex or football, though I have to make up something else when you ask, so don't.\r\n\r\nBecause I'm a guy, I do not want to visit your mother, or have your mother come visit us, or talk to her when she calls, or think about her any more than I have to. Whatever you got her for Mother's Day is okay, I don't need to see it. Did you remember to pick up something for my mom, too?\r\n\r\nBecause I'm a guy, I am capable of announcing, \"one more beer and I really have to go,\" and mean it every single time I say it, even when it gets to the point that the one bar closes and my buddies and I have to go hunt down another. I will find it increasingly hilarious to have my pals call you to tell you I'll be home soon, and no, I don't understand why you threw all my clothes into the front yard. What's the connection?\r\n\r\nBecause I'm a guy, you don't have to ask me if I liked the movie. Chances are, if you're crying at the end of it, I didn't.\r\n\r\nBecause I'm a guy, yes, I have to turn up the radio when Bruce Springsteen or The Doors comes on, and then, yes, I have to tell you every single time about how Bruce had his picture on the cover of Time and Newsweek the same day, or how Jim Morrison is buried in Paris and everyone visits his grave. Please do not behave as if you do not find this fascinating.\r\n\r\nBecause I'm a guy, I think what you're wearing is fine. I thought what you were wearing five minutes ago was fine, too.

        "body": "1. Women love to shop. It is the one area of the world where they feel like they're actually in control. \r\n\r\n2. Women especially love a bargain. The question of \"need\" is irrelevant, so don't bother pointing it out. Anything on sale is fair game. \r\n\r\n3. Women never have anything to wear. Don't question the racks of clothes in the closet; you \"just don't understand\". \r\n\r\n4. Women need to cry. And they won't do it alone unless they know you can hear them. \r\n\r\n5. Women will always ask questions that have no right answer, in an effort to trap you into feeling guilty. \r\n\r\n6. Women love to talk. Silence intimidates them and they feel a need to fill it, even if they have nothing to say. \r\n\r\n7. Women need to feel like there are people worse off than they are. That's why soap operas and Oprah Winfrey-type shows are so successful. \r\n\r\n8. Women don't need sex as often as men do. This is because sex is more physical for men and more emotional for women. Just knowing that the man wants to have sex with them fulfills the emotional need. \r\n\r\n9. Women hate bugs. Even the strong-willed ones need a man around when there's a spider or a wasp involved.\r\n\r\n10. Women can't keep secrets. They eat away at them from the inside. And they don't view it as being untrustworthy, providing they only tell two or three people. \r\n\r\n11. Women always go to public restrooms in groups. It gives them a chance to gossip. \r\n\r\n12. Women can't refuse to answer a ringing phone, no matter what she's doing. It might be the lottery calling. \r\n\r\n13. Women never understand why men love toys. Men understand that they wouldn't need toys if women had an \"on/off\" switch. \r\n\r\n14. Women think all beer is the same. \r\n\r\n15. Women keep three different shampoos and two different conditioners in the shower. After a woman showers, the bathroom will smell like a tropical rain forest. \r\n\r\n16. Women don't understand the appeal of sports. Men seek entertainment that allows them to escape reality. Women seek entertainment that reminds them of how horrible things could be. \r\n\r\n17. If a man goes on a seven-day trip, he'll pack five days worth of clothes and will wear some things twice; if a woman goes on a seven-day trip she'll pack 21 outfits because she doesn't know what she'll feel like wearing each day. \r\n\r\n18. Women brush their hair before bed. \r\n\r\n19. Watch a woman eat an ice cream cone and you'll have a pretty good idea about how she'll be in bed. \r\n\r\n20. Women are paid less than men, except for one field: Modeling. \r\n\r\n21. Women are never wrong. Apologizing is the man's responsibility, \"It's there in the Bible\". Hmmm, who was it that gave Adam the apple? \r\n\r\n22. Women do not know anything about cars. \"Oil-stick, oil doesn't stick?\" \r\n\r\n23. Women have better restrooms. They get the nice chairs and red carpet. Men just get a large bowl to share. \r\n\r\n24. The average number of items in a typical woman's bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.\r\n\r\n25. Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren't looking, men kick cats.\r\n\r\n26. Women love to talk on the phone. A woman can visit her girlfriend for two weeks, and upon returning home, she will call the same friend and they will talk for three hours.\r\n\r\n27. A woman will dress up to go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, or get the mail.\r\n\r\n28. Women will drive miles out of their way to avoid the possibility of getting lost using a shortcut.\r\n\r\n29. Women don't try as hard as men during sex; after all, they don't fall asleep afterwards.\r\n\r\n30. Women do NOT want an honest answer to the question, \"How do I look?\"\r\n\r\n31. PMS stands for: Permissible Man-Slaughter. (Or at least men think it means that. PMS also stands for Preposterous Mood Swings and Punish My Spouse. \r\n\r\n32. The first naked man a women sees is \"Ken\". \r\n\r\n33. Women are insecure about their weight, butt, and breast sizes.\r\n\r\n34. Women will make three right-hand turns to avoid making one left-hand turn.\r\n\r\n35. \"Oh, nothing,\" has an entirely different meaning in woman-language than it does in man-language.\r\n\r\n36. Lewis Carroll's Caterpillar had nothing on women.\r\n\r\n37. Women cannot use a map without turning the map to correspond to the direction that they are heading.\r\n\r\n38. All women are overweight by definition; don't agree with them about it. Women always have 5 pounds to lose, but don't bring this up unless they really have 5 pounds to gain.\r\n\r\n39. If it is not Valentines day and you see a man in a flower shop, you can probably start up a conversation by asking, \"What did you do?\"\r\n\r\n40. Only women understand the reason for \"guest towels\" and the \"good china\".\r\n\r\n41. Women want equal rights, but you rarely hear them clamoring to be let into the draft to cover the responsibilities that go with those rights. All women seek equality with men until it comes to sharing the closet, taking out the trash, and picking up the check.\r\n\r\n42. Origin of the word \"woman\" is: woo-man.\r\n\r\n43. If a man ticks off a woman she will often respond by getting a fuzzy toilet cover which warms their rear, but makes it impossible for the lid to stay up, thus it constantly gets peed on by the guys (which gets them in more trouble).\r\n\r\n44. Women never check to see if the lid is up. They seem to prefer taking a flying butt leap towards the bowl and then chewing men out because they \"left the seat up\" instead of taking two seconds and lowering it themselves.\r\n\r\n45. Women can get out of speeding tickets by pouting. This will get men arrested.\r\n\r\n46. Women don't really care about a sense of humor in a guy despite claims to the contrary. You don't see women trampling over Tom Cruise to get to Gilbert Gottfried, do you?\r\n\r\n47. Women fake orgasm because men fake foreplay.\r\n\r\n48. It's okay for women to dance with each other and not be gay. You don't see straight men dancing together.\r\n\r\n49. Women will spend hours dressing up to go out, and then they'll go out and spend more time checking out other women. Men can never catch women checking out other men; women will always catch men checking out other women.\r\n\r\n50. The most embarrassing thing for women is to find another woman wearing the same dress at a formal party. You don't hear men say, \"Oh-my-GOD, there's another man wearing a black tux, get me outta here!\"",

He was told to report to a nearby airport, where a single-engine plane would be waiting for him. \r\n\r\nHe arrived at the airport and saw a plane warming up near the gate.

So, He went in and made the necessary arrangements to have Finkelstein prepare a new robe for Him. A few days later, when the robe was finished, Jesus tried it on and it was a perfect fit! \r\n\r\nHe asked how much He owed, but Finkelstein brushed him off: \"No, no, no, for the Son of God? There's no charge! However, may I ask for a small favor?\" Whenever you give a sermon, perhaps you could just mention that your nice new robe was made by Finkelstein, the Tailor.\" \r\n\r\nJesus readily agreed and as promised, extolled the virtues of His Finkelstein robe whenever He spoke to the masses. \r\n\r\nA few months later, while Jesus was again walking through Jerusalem, He happened to walk past the Finkelstein shop and noted a huge line of people waiting for Finkelstein robes. \r\n\r\nHe pushed his way through the crowd to speak to him and as soon as Finkelstein spotted Him he said: \"Jesus, Jesus, look what you've done for my business! Would you consider a partnership?\" \r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied Jesus. \" 'Jesus & Finkelstein' it is.\" \r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, no,\" said Finkelstein. \" 'Finkelstein & Jesus'. After all, I am the craftsman.\" \r\n\r\nThe two of them debated this for some time. Their discussion was long and spirited but ultimately fruitful, and they finally came up with a mutually acceptable compromise. \r\n\r\nA few days later, the new sign went up over Finkelstein's shop. \r\n\r\nAnd of course, this shop is still here to this day.

If they don't get air they can drown, like my brother did last summer. (David age 7) \r\n\r\nOysters' balls are called pearls. (James age 6) \r\n\r\nIf you are surrounded by sea you are an Island. If you don't have sea all around you, you are incontinent. (Wayne age 7) \r\n\r\nI think sharks are ugly and mean, and have big teeth, just like Emily Richardson. She's not my friend no more. (Kylie age 6) \r\n\r\nA dolphin breaths through an asshole on the top of it's head. (Billy age 6) \r\n\r\nMy uncle goes out in his boat with pots, and comes back with crabs. (Millie age 6) \r\n\r\nWhen ships had sails, they used to use the trade winds to cross the ocean. Sometimes, when the wind didn't blow, the sailors would whistle to make the wind come. My brother said they would be better off eating beans. (William age 7) \r\n\r\nI like mermaids. They are beautiful, and I like their shiny tails. How do mermaids get pregnant? (Helen age 7) \r\n\r\nI'm not going to write about the sea. My baby brother is always screaming and being sick, my Dad keeps shouting at my Mom, and my big sister has just got pregnant, so I can't think what to write. (Amy age 8) \r\n\r\nSome fish are dangerous. Jelly fish can sting. Electric eels can give you a shock. They have to live in caves under the sea where I think they have to plug themselves into chargers. (Christopher age 7) \r\n\r\nMy mom has fish nets, but doesn't catch any fish (Laura age 5) \r\n\r\nWhen you go swimming in the sea, it is very cold, and it makes my willy small. (Kevin age 6) \r\n\r\nA submarine goes under the water like a fish, but it has lots of seamen inside. (Emma age 8) \r\n\r\nWhen I grow up, I want to be captain of a big ship, and have lots of sailors. (Valerie age 6) \r\n\r\nOn holiday my Mom went water skiing. She fell off when she was going very fast. She says she won't do it again because water shot up her fanny. (Julie age 7)",

The least expensive way is to look at her --\r\npreferably somewhere on her face -- and say, \"I love you, [her name here]\". If you forget her name, don't bother with the rest of the steps. You're dead.\r\n\r\nSTEP TWO: A Valentine card is an acceptable nonverbal token of appreciation. Best of all, it's cheap. Good Valentines are pink with lots of lace and have cute words such as \"I'll love my sugar bunny forever and ever and ever and ... \" Bad Valentine cards say, \"Good for one free quart of motor oil.\"\r\n\r\nSTEP THREE: Candy. For some scientific reason that makes no sense, women regard chocolate the same way men view beer. While a handful of M&Ms is OK, women tend to expect something a bit nicer. Wrapped up for starters.\r\n\r\nSTEP FOUR: Jewellery. A bit pricier, especially if you did not bother with steps 1-3. If you did, you might get by with a small but hideously expensive ring, necklace, or tiara. Keep in mind most women, even in Utah, do not consider aluminium, tin or a Mylar balloon to be a precious metal.\r\n\r\nSTEP FIVE: Lingerie. Be careful. Not only does it have to be the right size and caliber, it must also match any of the 8 billion feelings she currently has about herself. To be safe, tell the clerk you're looking for something that can't be used to strangle you in your sleep.\r\n\r\nSTEP SIX: Romantic getaways are good for couples with more than no kids. Studies prove that not even bacteria can reproduce when a toddler is beating on the bedroom door with a Fisher-Price toy. Depending on the size of your family, the romantic getaway may have to cross at least three international boundaries.\r\n\r\nSTEP SEVEN: Unlike men, women give points for trying. So do something. Anything is better than nothing. If you don't believe me, I can show you last year's knot still on the back of my head.",

        "body": "1. I had someone ask for an aisle seat so that their hair wouldn't get messed up by being near the window.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. A client called in inquiring about a package to Hawaii. After going over all the cost information, she asked, \"Would it be cheaper to fly to California and then take the train to Hawaii?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n3. I got a call from a woman who wanted to go to Capetown. I started to explain the length of the flight and the passport information when she interrupted me with \"I'm not trying to make you look stupid, but Cape Town is in Massachusetts.\" Without trying to make her look like the stupid one, I calmly explained, \"Cape Cod is in Massachusetts, Capetown is in Africa.\"\r\n\r\nHer response was \"click.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n4. A man called, furious about a Florida package we did. I asked what was wrong with the vacation in Orlando. He said he was expecting an ocean-view room. I tried to explain that is not possible, since Orlando is in the middle of the state. He replied, \"Don't lie to me. I looked on the map and Florida is a very thin state.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n5. I got a call from a man who asked, \"Is it possible to see England from Canada?\" \r\n\r\nI said, \"No.\" \r\n\r\nHe said, \"But they look so close on the map.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Another man called and asked if he could rent a car in Dallas. When I pulled up the reservation, I noticed he had a 1-hour lay over in Dallas. When I asked him why he wanted to rent a car, he said, \"I heard Dallas was a big airport, and I need a car to drive between the gates to save time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n7. A nice lady just called. She needed to know how it was possible that her flight from Detroit left at 8:20am and got into Chicago at 8:33am. I tried to explain that Michigan was an hour ahead of Illinois, but she could not understand the concept of time zones. Finally I told her the plane went very fast, and she bought that!\r\n\r\n\r\n8. A woman called and asked, \"Do airlines put your physical description\r\non your bag so they know whose luggage belongs to who?\" I said, \"No, why do you ask?\" She replied, \"Well, when I checked in with the airline, they put a tag on my luggage that said FAT, and I'm overweight, is there any connection?\" After putting her on hold for a minute while \"I looked into it,\" (I was actually laughing) I came back and explained that the city code for Fresno is FAT, and that the airline was just putting a destination tag on her luggage.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. I just got off the phone with a man who asked, \"How do I know which plane to get on?\" I asked him what exactly he meant, to which he replied, \"I was told my flight number is 823, but none of these darn planes have numbers on them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n10. \"A woman called and said, \"I need to fly to Pepsi-cola on one of those computer planes.\" I asked if she meant to fly to Pensacola on a commuter plane. She said, \"Yeah, whatever.\"\r\n\r\n11. A businessman called and had a question about the documents he needed in order to fly to China. After a lengthy discussion about passports, I reminded him he needed a visa. \"Oh no I don't, I've been to China many\r\ntimes and never had to have one of those.\" I double-checked and sure enough, his stay required a visa. When I told him this he said, Look, I've been to China four times and every time they have accepted my American Express.\"\r\n\r\n12. A woman called to make reservations. \"I want to go from Chicago to Hippopotamus, New York.\" The agent was at a loss for words. Finally, the agent asked, \"Are you sure that's the name of the town?\" \r\n\r\n\"Yes, what flights do you have?\" replied the customer. \r\n\r\nAfter some searching, the agent came back with, \"I'm sorry, ma'am, I've looked up every airport code in the country and can't find a Hippopotamus anywhere.\" \r\n\r\nThe customer retorted,\"Oh don't be silly. Everyone knows where it is. Check your map!\" \r\n\r\nThe agent scoured a map of the state of New York and finally offered, \"You don't mean Buffalo, do you?\"\r\n\r\n \"That's it! I knew it was a big animal!\"",

I liked it so much, I got one for us too.\" \r\n\r\nNo more was said about the statue, not even later that night when they went to sleep. Around two in the morning the husband got out of bed, went to the kitchen and returned a while later with a sandwich and a glass of milk. \r\n\r\n\"Here,\" he said to the 'statue', \"eat something. I stood like an idiot at the Smiths for three days and nobody offered me as much as a glass of water.\"",

They went to the barn where the farmer picked up a pig by the tail with his teeth. \"Yup, that there swine weighs 74 pounds.\" \r\n\r\nNoticing the man's bewilderment, the farmer explained that it was a family trait, passed on through generations, to be able to precisely weigh pigs in that manner.  The city slicker, however, insisted on a second opinion. So the farmer called his son over and the boy came up with the same result.  The man was ready to buy the pig on the spot, but the farmer said to go on up to the house and pay his wife. The man could then bring the receipt back to the farmer and take the pig.  After a long wait, the city slicker finally returned, but without a receipt. \r\n\r\n\"What's the problem, son?\" asked the farmer. \r\n\"I went up there like you said,\" said the man, \"And your wife was too busy.\" \r\n\"Busy doing what?\" \r\n\"Well, don't quote me on this,\" he warned, \"But I think she was weighing the milkman.\"",

Provides a handy ON-OFF switch in most current release.\r\n\r\nAIRLINE LUGGAGE VIRUS - You're in Dallas, but your data is in Singapore. \r\n\r\nAL GORE VIRUS - Claims that it is the Internet.

It'll be back!\r\n\r\nARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER VIRUS v 2.0 - Now widespread in California where it wiped out the Gray Davis virus and is terminating programs left and right in the state legislature's computers. \r\n\r\nAT&T VIRUS - Every three minutes it tells you what great service you are getting.\r\n\r\nBILL CLINTON VIRUS v 1.0 - It has a six inch hard drive and no memory.

This Virus protests your computer's involvement in other computer's affairs, even though it has been having one of its own for 12 years.\r\n\r\nBILL CLINTON VIRUS v 6.0 - Automatically connects to every URL in your Internet browser's list of bookmarks, then it tells you emphatically that your computer never made any connections to any URL, because since it didn't transmit and receive simultaneously, it wasn't really connected. \r\n\r\nBILL GATES VIRUS - This dominant strain searches for desirable features in all other viruses via the internet. It then either engulfs the competing viruses or removes their access to computers until they die out.\r\n\r\nBIN LADEN (aka AL QAEDA) VIRUS - displays threatening messages and spawns numerous smaller viruses that periodically destroy files. The Bin Laden virus and its spawned viruses are being seen less and less frequently and may be becoming extinct due to the spread of the George W. Bush virus. \r\n\r\nBIRTHDAY VIRUS - Keeps advancing your clock by another year. \r\n\r\nBOB DOLE VIRUS - Could be virulent, but it's been around too long to be much of a threat. \r\n\r\nBOB DOLE (aka VIAGRA) VIRUS - Makes a new hard drive out of an old floppy. \r\n\r\nBUREAUCRAT VIRUS - Divides your hard disk into hundreds of little units, each of which does practically nothing, but all of which claim to be the most important part of your computer. \r\n\r\nCHILD VIRUS - It constantly does annoying things, but is too cute to get rid of.\r\n\r\nCONGRESSIONAL VIRUS v 1.0 - It runs every program on the hard drive simultaneously but doesn't allow the user to accomplish anything.\r\n\r\nCOMGRESSIONAL VIRUS v 2.0 - Computer locks up, screen splits vertically with a message appearing on each half blaming the other side for the problem.\r\n\r\nCONGRESSIONAL VIRUS v 3.0 - Overdraws your disk space. \r\n\r\nCOUCH POTATO VIRUS - Just sits there, eating chips all day. \r\n\r\nDEMOCRAT VIRUS - Doesn't allow you to delete inefficient programs or wasted disc space - if you try, it accuses you of being a \"mean-spirited extremist\". \r\n\r\nDIET VIRUS - Allows your hard drive to lose weight by eliminating the FAT table.\r\n\r\nDISNEY VIRUS - Everything in the computer goes Goofy.\r\n\r\nDOLLY PARTON VIRUS - It sounds pretty good, but you'd swear your monitor looks larger and have more knobs than it used to.

Becomes very jealous of the size of your friend's hard drive.\r\n\r\nFRENCH VIRUS - garbles some files and then displays a message asking you for help. If you click OK, it just garbles more files and asks for help again. If you click Cancel, it displays the message, \"I surrender!\" and shuts down your computer. If you click Ignore, it scans your computer for the German and Russian viruses. If the French, Russian, and German viruses find each other, they merge into a single virus that conflicts with the George W. Bush virus, slowing it down. \r\n\r\nGALLUP POLL VIRUS - 60% of the PC's infected will lose 30% of their data 14% of the time (plus or minus a 3.5% margin of error). \r\n\r\nGEORGE MICHAEL VIRUS - Runs its course, occasionally releasing excess data buildup.\r\n\r\nGEORGE W.

BUSH VIRUS v 2.0 - Tells you it's going to eliminate all other viruses from your computer but that it may take a long time. Then it actually does scan your computer and eliminate viruses. It also scans for Programs of Mass Destruction (PMD), which are programs that destroy a lot of files if they are run. PMDs may be caused by a number of other viruses, such as the Saddam Hussein virus. The only problems with the George Bush virus are that it uses up a lot of your computer's resources while it's scanning, it never seems to find any PMDs, and it keeps switching the background color on your computer screen back and forth between yellow and orange. \r\n\r\nGERALDO RIVERA VIRUS - Digs dirt out of your files, but it airs the dirt for all to see.

Many experts believe this virus may become its most dangerous in 2008. \r\n\r\nHOWARD STERN VIRUS - One of the dirtiest viruses around. It writes 4 letter words to all of your files just to annoy the operating system. It also installs an X-rated GIF on your hard drive.

SIMPSON VIRUS v 1.0 - It claims that it did not, could not, and would not delete two of your files and vows to find the virus that did it.\r\n\r\nO.J. SIMPSON VIRUS v 2.0 (Often accompanied by the Johnny Cochran Virus.) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 You know it's guilty of trashing your system, but you just can't prove it.

Some of the spawned viruses are still in existence but are gradually being eradicated by the George W. Bush virus. PMDs spawned by the Saddam Hussein virus, if they exist, have yet to be found because they have the \"hidden\" attribute set. The Saddam Hussein virus wasn't seen for a long time because of the rapid spread of the George Bush virus. At the end of 2003, the George Bush virus found every instance of the Saddam Hussein virus, which was discovered to have mutated into a harmless, ugly graphic hiding in the Trash/Recycle Bin. \r\n\r\nSEARS VIRUS - Your data won't appear unless you buy new cables, power supply, and a set of shocks. \r\n\r\nSHARON STONE VIRUS - Makes a huge initial impact, then you forget it's there.\r\n\r\nSLACKER VIRUS - Uses 80% of your computer's resources, yet does absolutely nothing. \r\n\r\nSONNY BONO VIRUS - Just when you get to surfing the web, a firewall appears out of nowhere.\r\n\r\nSPICE GIRL VIRUS - Has no real function, but makes a pretty desktop.\r\n\r\nSPRINT VIRUS - Periodically runs sound file of a pin dropping. \r\n\r\nSTAR TREK VIRUS - Invades your system in places where no virus has gone before.\r\n\r\nSYEPHEN KING VIRUS - It wipes a fifth of your hard drive, then tells you that if enough people send in a dollar, it will destroy the rest in some surprising, exciting way. \r\n\r\nSURVIVOR VIRUSES - Deletes your files one by one over 13 weeks until only the most annoying one remains. \r\n\r\nTECH STOCK VIRUS - At the slightest hint of an error, plays a screaming panic sound and shuts down your computer. \r\n\r\nTED KENNEDY VIRUS - It drives your files into the bitstream, crashes your computer, then denies it ever happened.\r\n\r\nTED TURNER VIRUS - Colorizes your monochrome monitor.\r\n\r\nTEENAGER VIRUS - Your PC stops every few seconds to ask for money.\r\n\r\nTEXAS VIRUS - Makes sure that it's bigger than any other file.\r\n\r\nTIGER WOODS VIRUSES - Assumes pre-eminence over other applications, which are left to operate at consistently humiliating performance levels.

The result was monumental havoc and a great outcry by the populace. The Gray Davis virus has not been seen since the appearance of the Arnold Schwarzenegger virus. \r\n\r\nHANS BLIX VIRUS - is a derivative of the U.N. virus. It tells you it's going to inspect your computer for viruses, but then it just creates all sorts of text files filled with bureaucratic drivel, all the while displaying messages saying it needs more time. It never finds any viruses. The quickest cure for this virus is the George Bush virus. \r\n\r\nIMELDA MARCOS VIRUS v 1.0 - Sings you a song (slightly off key) on boot up, then subtracts money from your Quicken account and spends it all on expensive shoes it purchases through AOL.\r\n\r\nIMELDA MARCOS VIRUS v 2.0 - After depleting your bank account, returns to infect you again!

If detected, it claims it doesn't remember being there.\r\n\r\nRONALD REAGAN VIRUS v 2.0 - Saves your data, but forgets where it's stored. \r\n\r\nROSANNE BARR VIRUS - Plays the National Anthem at boot-up.

Both of these viruses destroyed files, but the Uday virus also displayed pornographic images. Both of these viruses were completely eliminated by the spread of the George W. Bush virus. \r\n\r\nWARREN COMMISSION VIRUS - Won't allow you to open your files for 75 years.\r\n\r\nWATERGATE VIRUS - Erases 18 minutes off your tape backup.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM KENNEDY SMITH VIRUS - It strips your files, manipulates your data\r\nand denies anything ever happened; and gets away with it.",

The horse reared, and the cowboy drew his six-gun to shoot the snake.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on there, partner,\" said the snake, \"don't shoot - I'm an enchanted rattlesnake, and if you don't shoot me, I'll give you any three wishes you want.\"\r\n\r\nThe cowboy decided to take a chance; he knew he was safely out of the snake's striking range.

        "body": "If you have raised kids (or been one), and gone through the pet syndrome including toilet-flush burials for dead goldfish. It's a long story but one that will have you laughing out LOUD!\r\n\r\nOverview: I had to take my son's hamster to the vet. Here's what happened:\r\n\r\nJust after dinner one night, my son came up to tell me there was something wrong with one of the two hamsters he holds prisoner in his room. \"He's just lying there looking sick,\" he told me, \"I'm serious, Dad. Can you help?\"\r\n\r\nI put my best hamster-healer look on my face and followed him into his bedroom. One of the little rodents was indeed lying on his back, looking stressed. I immediately knew what to do. (Call my wife.)\r\n\r\n\"Honey,\" I called, \"come look at the hamster!\" \"Oh, my gosh,\" my wife diagnosed after a minute. \"She's having babies.\" \"What?\" my son demanded.\r\n\r\n\"But their names are Bert and Ernie, Mom!\"\r\n\r\nI was equally outraged. \"Hey, how can that be?! I thought we said we didn't want them to reproduce!\" I accused my wife. \"Well, what do you want me to do, post a sign in their cage?!\" she inquired. (I actually think she had the gall to say this sarcastically.)\r\n\r\n\"No, but you were supposed to get two boys!\" I reminded her (in my most loving, calm, sweet voice, while gritting my teeth together). \"Yeah, Bert and Ernie!\" my son agreed. \"Well, it's just a little hard to tell on some guys, ya know,\" she informed me. (Again with the sarcasm, ya think?)\r\n\r\nBy now the rest of the family had gathered to see what was going on. I shrugged, deciding to make the best of it. \"Kids, this is going to be a wonderous experience,\" I announced. \"We're about to witness the miracle of birth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, gross!\" they shrieked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, isn't THAT just great! What are we going to do with a litter of tiny little hamster babies?\" my wife wanted to know. (I really do think she was being snotty here, too, don't you?)\r\n\r\nWe peered at the patient. After much struggling, what looked like a tiny foot would appear briefly, vanishing a scant second later. \"We don't appear to be making much progress,\" I noted.\r\n\r\n\"It's breech,\" my wife whispered, horrified. \"Do something, Dad!\" my son urged. \"Okay, okay.\" Squeamishly, I reached in and grabbed the foot when it next appeared, giving it a gingerly tug. It disappeared. I tried several more times with the same results.\r\n\r\n\"Should I call 911?\" my eldest daughter wanted to know, \"maybe they could talk us through the trauma.\" (You see a pattern here with the females in my house?)\r\n\r\n\"Let's get Ernie to the vet,\" I said grimly.\r\n\r\nWe drove to the vet with my son holding the cage in his lap. \"Breathe, Ernie, breathe,\" he urged.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think hamsters do Lamaze,\" his mother noted. (Women can be so cruel to their own young. I mean, what she does to ME is one thing, but this boy is of her womb.)\r\n\r\nThe vet took Ernie back to the examining room and peered at the little animal through a magnifying glass. \"What do you think, Doc, a c-section?\" I suggested scientifically. My son appeared impressed by my observation.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very interesting,\" he murmured. \"Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, may I speak to you privately for a moment?\" I gulped, nodding for my son to step outside.\r\n\r\n\"Is Ernie going to be okay?\" My wife asked. \"Oh, perfectly,\" the vet assured us.\r\n\r\n\"This hamster is not in labor. In fact, that isn't EVER going to happen, because Ernie is a boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, Ernie is a young male, and occasionally, as they come into maturity, like most male species, they um .... er ... masturbate, just the way he did, lying on his back.\" He blushed, glancing at my wife. \"Well, you know what I'm saying, Mr. Cameron.\"\r\n\r\nWe were silent, absorbing this.\r\n\r\n\"So Ernie's just ... just ... excited?\"! my wife offered.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" the vet replied, relieved that we understood. More silence. Then my vicious, cruel wife started to giggle. And laugh. And then even laugh loudly!\r\n\r\n\"What's so funny?\" I demanded, knowing, but not believing, that the woman I married would commit the upcoming affront to my flawless manliness. Tears were now running down her face.\r\n\r\n\"It's just ... that ... I'm picturing you pulling on its ... its teeny little ...\" she gasped for more air to bellow in laughter once more.\r\n\r\n\"That's enough,\" I warned.\r\n\r\nWe thanked the Veterinarian and hurriedly bundled the hamsters and our son back into the car. He was glad everything was going to be okay.\r\n\r\n\"I know Ernie's really thankful for what you've done, Dad,\" he told me.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you have NO idea,\" my wife agreed, once again collapsing into laughter.\r\n\r\nEnough said.",

In a short time, ice began to form on his wings and he fell to earth in a barnyard, almost frozen.\r\n\r\nA cow passed by and crapped on the little sparrow. The sparrow thought it was the end. But, the manure warmed him and defrosted his wings. Warm and happy, able to breathe, he started to sing. Just then a large cat came by and, hearing the chirping, investigated the sounds.\r\nThe cat cleared away the manure, found the chirping bird and promptly ate him.\r\n\r\nThe moral of the story:\r\n\r\n1.) Everyone who craps on you is not necessarily your enemy.\r\n\r\n2.) Everyone who gets you out of the crap is not necessarily your friend.\r\n\r\n3.)

You sit down expecting the worst, but what you get is a smooth sliding, fartless masterpiece that breaks the water with the splashless grace of an expert diver. But that's not the end of it. You use some toilet tissue only to find that it was totally unnecessary. It makes you feel that all is right with the world and you are in perfect harmony with it.\r\n\r\nThe Beer Dump-\r\nTalk about nasty dumps. Depending on the dumper's tolerance, the beer dump is the end result of too many beers. it could have been 2 or 22, it doesn't matter. What you get is a sinister, lengthy, noisy dump accompanied by a malevolent fog that could close a bathroom for days.\r\n\r\nThe Chili Dump-\r\nHot when it goes in, and rocket fuel when it leaves. The chili dump stays with you all day, making your tush feel like a heat shield.\r\n\r\nThe Cable Dump- \r\nLong, curly and perfectly formed like 2 feet of E13 telephone CO-axial cable. It loops lazily around the bowl, like a friendly serpent. You wonder admiringly, \"DID I DO THAT? Where did it come from?\" you leave the bathroom pleased with yourself.\r\n\r\nThe Latrine Dump-\r\nIn case you didn't know, a latrine is a hole in the ground with a tent around it where soldiers, boy scouts and flies go to dump. Tip: Don't ever, ever look in the hole.\r\n\r\nThe Mona Lisa Dump-\r\nThis is the masterpiece of dumps. It's as perfectly formed as it can be. Delicate and slender with intricacies that would make da Vinci weep. And just think, you made it yourself. You may even want to break out the Polaroid, but maybe that's going a bit too far.\r\n\r\nThe Empty Roll Dump- \r\nYou're done...you reach for the toilet paper only to discover that empty cardboard cylinder. A mild panic begins coldly in your throat. You could use the curtains...no, someone would say \"Where are the curtains?\" Then what would you say? The rug?...too cumbersome. Then you must come to the same conclusion that every \"empty roll dumper\" must face...Pull up your slacks, tighten your tush and wriggle yourself to the nearest full roll.\r\n\r\nThe Splash Back Dump-\r\nYou send the dump on its way, it drops like a depth charge into the bowl creating a column of cold bowl water that washes your bottom with a startlingly unpleasant shock. Now you're wet and embarrassed.\r\nTip: Blot instead of wiping.\r\n\r\nThe Aborted Dump- \r\nYou are in mid-dump when the phone rings. What do you do? ABORT! Pinch it off, go for the phone, and save the rest for later. It isn't pretty, but you've gotta do what you gotta do.\r\n\r\nThe Caesarian Dump- \r\nPain, that's what this dump and childbirth have in common. Its simply a case of too much dump trying to go through too small a hole, and there's no obstetrician to help.\r\n\r\nThe Alfresco Dump- \r\nEveryone has had to go outdoors from time to time. This can be a rather pleasant experience really. The open air, the nature, and a good bush all contribute to the peaceful ambiance that our primitive forefathers must have enjoyed. What can screw up this harmonious interlude is a troop of brownies or a patch of poison ivy.\r\n\r\nThe Childbirth Dump- \r\nThis is a dump that is simply too big to go through the aperture provided by nature for the purpose. You sit there, thinking over your dilemma. First it hurts, and it isn't going to get any better. You wonder if you'll ever see your loved ones again. You imagine the newspaper headlines screaming \"Man dies trying to hatch monster loaf\". You realize you'll have to resolve the crisis before you can leave the bathroom. Basically there are only three things you can do:\r\n\r\n1. Scream \r\n2. Call an Obstetrician \r\n3. Hope like hell have enough Vaseline to get you through it.\r\n\r\nThe Tijuana Trot Dump- \r\nThe phrase \"Sh*t Happens\" really applies here in a big way. When the ice in your tainted margarita makes contact with your lower intestinal tract, the fun begins. For the next 72 hours you'd be better off if you carried your own portable toilet with you because you will spend most of that time on the pot and the rest of the time in a fetal position. Now you realize why Mexico never had a navy.\r\n\r\nThe Machine Gun Dump- \r\nYou're just sitting there in a state of sublime peace when all of a sudden you emit a group of noisy gassy bursts that break the silence like machine gun fire. The guy in the next stall hits the floor like a combat veteran cradling his umbrella like an M16...damn commies.\r\n\r\nThe Sound Effect Dump- \r\nYou feel a noisy one coming on. Relatives, friends or work mates are within earshot, so you must employ some clever techniques to cover the disgusting sounds you are about to emit. Timing is obviously very important here. At the precise moment of release, try the following sound effects: \r\n\r\n1. Flush the toilet \r\n2. Sing the first two stanzas of your national anthem \r\n3. Drop a handful of quarters on the floor \r\n\r\nThe Security Dump-\r\nYou have enough on your mind when you're in the bathroom without worrying about a lockless door and someone bursting in to find you in mid-dump mode. So how can you prevent this embarrassing spectacle from taking place? One way is to strategically place your foot against the door. If you can't reach to do this...hum loudly\r\n\r\nThe Cling-On Dump- \r\nFor the most part you've completed your dump, but there's one little morsel that refuses to drop off. You're getting impatient. Someone else wants to use your stall. So, you grip the seat with both hands and wriggle, twist and pump but that last little stubborn piece just hangs there, suspended, clinging like a canned peach between you and the bowl water. Maybe the person pounding impatiently on the door has scissors\r\n\r\nThe Houdini Dump- \r\nYou go, then you stand up to flush, and the darn thing has disappeared. Where'd it go? Did it creep down the pipe? Did you dream the whole thing? Is it lurking out of sight? Should you wipe...maybe you should just to make sure you went. Should you flush? you'd better, because if you don't, you know it will reappear and smile at the next person who comes in\r\n\r\nThe Flu Dump- \r\nYou feel so bad that you don't know which end of you to put down first. You have roaring cramps, so you sit down. Then a wave of nausea rolls over you like a cold fog, so you stand up and cramps squeeze your intestines like a vice so you sit down again...up down up down. Don't you wish Mom were close by?\r\n\r\nThe Porta-Pottie Dump-\r\nConstruction workers and outdoor concert goers will tell you about going in a portable toilet. My best description would be, \"Its like taking a shit in an upright coffin\". Its claustrophobic and it smells bad...best advice...go in a paper cup.\r\n\r\nThe Proctologist Dump- \r\nIn the beginning, the lord created the earth, the sky and the firmament, but I hope he didn't create this dump, because there is nothing biblical about it, you run out of gas. That's right, you run out of propulsion. The dump is right there at the end of your barrel and refuses to go any further. You grunt, you squeeze, you wriggle but it just stays there like a lump of lead. You've only got two choices here. One is to squeeze the damn thing back up your intestine and wait until next time. The other is to pretend you're a proctologist and go after it yourself. Not a pretty picture is it?? \r\n\r\nThe Whole Roll Dump- \r\nNo matter how much you wipe, it doesn't seem to be enough. You blow the whole roll and you have to flush 25 times too. The whole episode is consumer waste.\r\n\r\nThe Graffiti Dump- \r\nYou flush the dump and the swirling motion of the receding bowl water forces the dump to the porcelain sides, scraping a creative squiggle on its way down. You flush again but the curlicue hangs there...love it or leave it. Its your choice.\r\n\r\nThe Encore Dump- \r\nAhhhh, you're done, so you wipe, put yourself together, wash your hands and are about to vacate the bathroom when you feel another dump coming. You have to return for a curtain call. The world's record is seven encores.\r\n\r\nThe Born Again Dump- \r\nThis is a dump that's going so badly, you say \"Lord, if I live through this, I'll take up religion\" you always get through it, but seldom keep the promise you made in desperation, because a born again dump is like childbirth...you forget the pain quickly.",

He thinks nothing of it, and is about to shoot when he hears\r\n\r\n \"Ribbit, 9 iron\"\r\n\r\n The man looks around and doesn't see anybody. So he gets ready again, when he hears \r\n\r\n\"Ribbit 9 iron\"\r\n\r\n He looks at the frog, and decides to prove him wrong. He puts away his club, and gets a 9 iron. \r\n\r\nHe whacked that ball, and it landed 10 in. from the cup! He was shocked, and looked at the frog, \"Wow, that was amazing\" he said \"You must be a lucky frog then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ribbit, Lucky Frog\"\r\n\r\nThe man takes the frog to the next hole. \"What do you think?\" he said. \r\n\r\n\"Ribbit, 3 wood\"\r\n\r\nThe man takes out his 3 wood, and hit the ball. Hole in 1! He was befuddled, and didn't know what to say. \r\n\r\nHe took the frog to every hole, and he golfed his best game.\r\n\r\n\"OK,\" said the man \"Where to next?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ribbet, Las Vegas\"\r\n\r\nSo off they went, to Las Vegas. When they arive, he asks, \"Now what?\" \r\n\r\n\"Ribbit, Roulette Wheel\"\r\n\r\n\"What should I bet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ribbit, $3000, black 6\"\r\n\r\nAfter the luck at golfing, the man says, \"What the hell.\" \r\n\r\nThen, suddenly loads of  cash came sliding across the table; he got it.\r\n\r\nHe takes his winnings and buys the best hotel room, and he, of course, brings the frog.\r\n\r\n\"Frog, you have won me all this money, and I do not know how to repay you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ribbit, Kiss Me\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOOF........\r\n\r\nThe frog becomes a 10 year old boy. \"And that, your honor, is how the boy got into my room.

        "body": "SHOTGUN RULES: \r\nEver have the problem of catching a ride with someone whose car doesn't have much of a back seat? At times like these, it is important to know the rules of calling shotgun. Never again will you let someone take advantage of you because you don't know the rules. \r\n \r\nSection I - General Rules\r\n1) The first person to yell \"SHOTGUN\" gets to ride in the front seat.\r\n2) The remaining back seats may be divvied up in the same manner by being the first to call \"back right seat\", etc..\r\n3) The word \"shotgun\" must be loud enough to be heard by at least one witness. If no witness is to be found, or in case of a tie, the driver has the final word. After all, it is most likely his car. (note: if it isn't his car, and the owner is present, the owner's decision is final. Owner must be sober, however, or he will defer his judgment to the driver.)\r\n4) Early calls are strictly prohibited. All occupants of the vehicle (including the driver) must be outside of the building and directly on the way to the vehicle before shotgun may be called. Under no circumstances may a person call shotgun inside a building. For sake of simplicity, a garage is considered to be outside. Parking structures and detached garages are always considered as being outdoors, even if they are underground. \r\n5) A person may only call shotgun for one way of a trip. Shotgun can never be called while inside a vehicle or still technically on the way to the first location. For example, one can not get out of a vehicle and call Shotgun for the return journey.\r\n6) Being as how everyone is created equal, men have the same right as women to the front seat of the car. i.e. women don't own the front seat.\r\n7) One is allowed to ride shotgun as many times as he can call it, but for himself only. No one can call shotgun for their slower friend, unless the friend has a speech or mental handicap that prevents them from calling it for themselves.\r\n8) The driver has final say in all ties and disputes. The driver has the right to suspend or remove all shotgun privileges from one or more persons. \r\nSection II - Special Cases\r\nThese special exceptions to the rules above should be considered in the order presented; the case listed first will take precedence over any of the cases beneath it, when applicable.\r\n1) In the instance that the normal driver of a vehicle is drunk or otherwise unable to perform their duties as driver, then he/she is automatically given Shotgun.\r\n2) If the instance that the person who actually owns the vehicle is not driving, then he/she is automatically given Shotgun, unless they decline.\r\n3) In the instance the driver's spouse, lover, partner, or hired prostitute for the evening is going to accompany the group, he/she is automatically given Shotgun, unless they decline.\r\n4) In the instance that one of the passengers may become so ill during the course of the journey that the other occupants feel he/she will toss their cookies, then the ill person should be given Shotgun to make appropriate use of the window.\r\n5) In the instance that only one person knows how to get to a given location and this person is not the driver, then as the designated navigator for the group they automatically get Shotgun, unless they decline.\r\n6) In the instance that one of the occupants is too wide or tall to fit comfortably in the back seat, then the driver may show mercy and award Shotgun to the genetic misfit. Alternatively, the driver and other passengers may continually taunt the poor fellow as they make a three hour trip with him crammed in the back.\r\n\r\nSection III - The Survival Of The Fittest Rules (a.k.a The Bastard Rules)\r\n1) If the driver so wishes, he/she may institute the Survival Of The Fittest Rules on the process of calling Shotgun. In this case all rules, excepting 1.8, are suspended and the passenger seat is occupied by whoever can take it by force.\r\n2) The driver must announce the institution of the Survival Of The Fittest Rules with reasonable warning to all passengers. This clause reduces the amount of blood lost by passengers and the damage done to the vehicle.\r\n3) Please follow the above rules to the best of your ability. If there are any arguments or exceptions not covered in these rules, please refer to rule 1.8.\r\n\r\nSection IV - Revisions\r\n1) These rules shall be subject to either revision or amendment at any time. But, changes and new rules you create during a car ride do not take effect until the next car ride. \r\n2) Since there is an established body currently in place to distribute world-wide information, it is proposed that the United Nations oversee the adoption, updates (as required) and enforcement of these rules once adopted by at least two-thirds of the current membership of the UN. \r\n3) It shall be the responsibility of all drivers to have a current copy of these rules in the vehicle's glove compartment, so that disputes may be resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection V - Amendments \r\nAmendment I: The Laser / Shotgun Double Barrel Rule \r\nA person may call \"laser\" or \"Shotgun Double Barrel\" after shotgun has been called, to override the shotgun call. This is only valid if the driver verifies the call as we see in Section 1.3. \r\nAdditionally, any passenger who says \"No Blitz\" after claiming shotgun, may not have it taken away by either the \"Laser\" or \"Double Barrel\" rules. \r\nThese rules hold no precedence over Standard shotgun procedure, and the driver has final say in all calls.\r\n\r\nAmendment II: The Specific Amendment\r\nAny person who wishes to claim shotgun must actually pronounce either the word \"Shotgun\" or \"Gun.\" One may not say the name of a type of shotgun, such as \"12 Gauge.\" If a passenger does, then he or she can lay no claim on shotgun, and may be called by another person. \r\n\r\nAmendment III: The \"House\" Rule\r\nThe Owner of the vehicle decides which Shotgun Amendments to institute on his own car. All passengers must abide by the rules of these Amendments, which are stated in this document. This Amendment clarifies that not all Amendments need be active at any given time. \r\n\r\nAmendment IV: Eviction\r\nIf the vehicle is forced to stop for a serious infraction of the Shotgunner, the Shotgunner must relinquish his/her seat, if the driver so wishes. \r\nSerious infractions have been known to include spilling alcoholic beverages, spilling any beverage, being annoying, breaking parts of the car, and in extreme cases, just being ugly. \r\n\r\nAmendment V: The Shotgun Clause\r\nThis rule native to the south, but practical in many northern cities, states that the potential occupant with the largest caliber weapon on their person defaults to shotgun, unless one occupant is actually armed with a shotgun, in which case he gets shotgun. If two or more occupants actually have shotguns, then the over/under barrel configuration rules. \r\n\r\nAmendment VI: The Reserve Shotgun Amendment (Bitch, Spanky, Comm and SAM)\r\nAfter Shotgun has been called, other patrons may call \"Bitch,\" \"Spanky,\" or \"Comm,\" referring to the seat behind shotgun, the seat behind the driver, and the center back seat, respectively. SAM applies to the hatchback or trunk. \r\n\r\nAmendment VII: Navigator\r\nThe passenger who has shotgun MUST serve as Navigator. By this, he must watch out for signs and intersections that the driver may miss during the course of a road trip. The Navigator must also ask for directions out the window. \r\nIt is also the responsibility of the passenger who has shotgun to take control of the radio and air conditioning, however the driver has final say over the settings. The other occupants of the car can also have an opinion. If the passenger with shotgun is caught forgetting their duties and makes the car listen to commercials and/or bad music, then his privilege can be lost. Of course, this is all in good judgement of the driver. As Navigator, the driver may also ask him to operate other devices such as the windshield wipers, and rear window defroster. \r\nIt is also the job of the Navigator throw all trash and empty beer bottles out of the window. The beer bottles must be crushed under the tires to destroy all evidence, in case of an emergency situation.\r\nIn addition, the Navigator must possess the ability and the will to insult other drivers and be heard, only if they deserve it (ie: being cut off). This is to allow the driver to continue to operate the vehicle properly.\r\nThe Navigator must possess the ability (and the will) to roll down their window and invite any chicks in adjacent cars to the driver's destination. \r\n\r\nAmendment VIII: First Blood\r\nThis rule from the mid-west states that whoever draws blood (supposedly when the Survival of the Fittest rules are in effect) gets shoved in the back of the hatchback (or trunk) with the spare tire. \r\n\r\nAmendment IX: Australian Shotgun\r\nOriginally from Australia, if two people tie for shotgun, then the first person to put their thumb on their head is awarded shotgun. If they both do this at the same time, then an immediate pissbolt (race) to the car is required. \r\n\r\nAmendment X: Five Minute Rule\r\nThis rule, which originated in Massachusetts, states that in the event that the passenger riding shotgun leaves the car (ie: to get something from his house or a convenient store) is allowed 5 minutes in which to return and still retain his shotgun privilege. If he does not return within the time frame allotted, another passenger may take his place. There are other variations to this rule such as the \"Two Hour Rule,\" but these usually result in the shotgunner geting beaten up by the other passengers.\r\n\r\nAmendment XI: Awnings\r\nOnce all passengers have exited through the final doorway on the way to the car, (provided the car is in view), they are considered outside and may call shotgun no matter what covering is overhead. This rule applies to all awnings, covered decks and all outdoor shelters. Garages are considered outside so long as the door is open. \r\n\r\nAmendment XII: National Bitch\r\nThis rule alters Amendment VI, where the caller of \"Bitch\" gains the center back seat. Comm is replaced with \"Spanky 2,\" referring to the seat behind Shotgun. \r\n\r\nAmendment XIII: Refueling\r\nIn addition to Amendment VII, if the car needs refueling at any time, it is the duty of the Shotgunner to gas up the car and pay (though usually with money given by the driver). \r\n\r\nAmendment XIV: The Race\r\nIf there is a tie when calling shotgun, the first person who touches the car wins. \r\n\r\nAmendment XV: Ozzie Pissbolt\r\nIf the driver gets confused or annoyed with chaotic rules arguments, he may shout \"Ozzie Pissbolt,\" suggesting that the first person to touch the car is awarded shotgun. \r\n\r\nAmendment XVI: Jedi Run\r\nIf the car is not within sight of the driver, and significantly far away, so that the proposed walk to the vehicle is neither linear nor within five minutes, the initiating party may call \"Jedi Run\" after a successful shotgun call (vehicle visibility is not required for this success). She must then beat all other opponents to the vehicle. In order to secure shotgun, the initiating party must not be out of breath or tired by the time the rest of the troupe arrives. This overrides any other countermeasures for shotgun if executed before they come into effect. \r\n\r\nAmendment XVII: Alternate Names\r\nThis amendment adds additional aliases.\r\nShotgun may also be called under the following aliases: Gun, Shogun, Catgut, and Shotty. Bitch (as in, behind shotgun) may also be called under the following aliases: Rightsies and On-The-Rightsies SAM may also be called under the following aliases: Turrets \r\n\r\nAmendment XVIII: Alternative Seats\r\nIn addition to Amendment XVII, anyone who wants to be duct-taped to the roof calls \"Mir!\" If a trunk is present in the vehicle, then this \"seat\" will hereby be recognized as \"Ex-Wife.\" \r\n\r\nAmendment XIV: The Recall Rule\r\nOnce a passenger has called shotgun, another passenger may call \"Recall Shotgun,\" thereby overriding the shotgun call and claiming shotgun for themselves. In order for this not to happen the first passenger must call \"Shotgun, No Recall.\" This rule is similar to the \"No Blitz\" call.\r\n\r\nAmendment XX: Reversion\r\nIf the original caller of shotgun lost their seat to some countermeasure, the initial caller may shout \"Same Seatsies\" to regain their right to shotgun. In addition, \"Double Barrel\" and \"Laser\" may be followed by \"No Blitz,\" so that the original caller cannot regain their shotgun right. \"No Blitz\" and \"Same Seatsies\" are synonymous with \"No Recall\" and \"Recall Shotgun,\" respectively. \r\n\r\nAmendment XXI: Duel\r\nIn such a case where any present shotgun rules still causes confusion between two individuals, they may duel for the honor of Shotgun. This duel takes the form of one (and only one) round of traditional \"paper, rock, scissor.\" Alternatively, this may be replaced by one (and only one) round of \"odds or evens.\" \r\n\r\nAmendment XXII: Chinese Sneak Attack\r\nIn the event that someone manages to touch the car's handle, and/or is in the car before anyone called shotgun, then they immediately receive the shotgun priviledge. However, this amendment does not apply to someone who ran to the vehicle in question in order to do so. \r\n\r\nAmendment XXIII: Broken Seat\r\nIn the event that the front passenger seat in the car is extremely uncomfortable (i.e. has a big hole in it), the passenger who called Shotgun must sit in that seat. The other passengers may ridicule him as they wish. \r\n\r\nAmendment XXIV: Smoking\r\nIn the event that smoking is allowed in said vehicle, smoking passengers are given consideration over non-smokers in order that they may utilize either the window or ashtray. \r\nIn the event that there is more than one smoking passenger, the passenger that has already lit-up has Shotgun privilege over those who are not already engaged in the act of smoking. \r\nIn the event that more than one smoker is already smoking while on the way to the vehicle, the driver may enforce The Survival of the Fittest Rules or First Blood Rule. This however, is not recommended do to the high risk factor to the vehicle in question. As stated in Section I Article 8 of the Constitution, the driver has all final say in disputes between passengers.\r\n\r\nAmendment XXV: Secondary Passenger\r\nIf a passenger is \"just along for the ride,\" then they must sit in the back seat (or worst seat, if the car is otherwise full), because the ride is not for them. \r\n\r\nAmendment XXVI: Double Shotgun\r\nThis rule from Delaware states that if a given passenger calls a valid \"shotgun\", then he or she may not say \"shotgun\" again. By calling \"shotgun\" a second time, he or she would automatically forfeit their seat and shotgun is reopened to the other passengers. \r\nOther passengers are allowed to try to trick the person who originally says \"shotgun\" into saying it again, in order to claim shotgun for themselves. \r\n\r\nAmendment XXVII: Contraband\r\nIn the event that the car is about to pass an abandoned case of beer, pornography, or any other form of contraband that the passengers might find useful in some way or another, it is the responsibility of the passenger riding shotgun to open his door and scoop up the said beer, pornography or contraband, while the car is still in motion. \r\nAdditionally, if the car is moving at a speed above 15 M.P.H. (24 km/h) the passenger riding shotgun may decline to do so.\r\n\r\nAmendment XXVIII: No Bitch\r\nThis rule states that once Shotgun has been called by one of the passengers, the remaining passengers may call, \"No Bitch.\" The passenger who calls \"No Bitch\" last, or fails to call it at all, is forced to ride bitch. \r\n\r\nAmendment XXIX: No Chauffeur / Compulsory Shotgun\r\nIn the event that there are fewer passengers than capacity would allow, there must always be a passenger riding shotgun. This would include a couple. This is to prevent the driver from feeling ditched, or like a chauffeur.\r\n\r\nAmendment XXX: Seniority\r\nIn the instance that one of the passengers is much older than the rest of the passengers, he/she is automatically given Shotgun unless they decline. \r\n\r\nAmendment XXXI: Ten-Foot Rule\r\nThis rule native to Myrtle Beach and Charleston, SC, states that once a passenger has called Shotgun, another passenger may call \"10 Foot Rule.\" In this case, there would be an immediate race for the car. The first passenger to come within 10 feet of the car is awarded Shotgun. \r\n\r\nAmendment XXXII: Backfire\r\nThis rule from Central NC states that if a passenger has shotgun on a trip, and then calls shotgun for the return trip, any passenger may call, \"Double Shotgun Backfire,\" to prevent a single passenger from dominating the front seat. \r\n\r\nAmendment XXXIII: International Travel\r\nWhen crossing the border into another country. All shotgun claims are void, and passengers may once again call shotgun. If another passenger gets it, the driver must pull over at his earliest and safest convenience. \r\n\r\nAmendment XXXIV: Context\r\nA passenger may only receive shotgun if he says shotgun within the context of calling shotgun. For instance, a passenger may not be awarded shotgun if he says, \"Did anybody call shotgun?,\" or if he/she was talking about a shotgun. \r\n\r\nAmendment XXXV: Language\r\nIf you reside in a non-English-speaking locale, Shotgun must be called by its native word. For instance, in Sweden, the word \"Hagelbossa\" must be pronounced, while in Germany, \"Schrotflinte.\" \r\nShotgun may be called in any language the driver is fluent in. \"Fluent\" is described here as being proficient enough in a language to understand conversation exchanges. \r\nOrder of preference rewards the language closest to the native language of the locale in which Shotgun is called. For instance, if the call is made is Sweden, and the only calls were \"Schrotflinte\" and \"Escopeta\" (Spanish), respectively, the seat will be given to the second caller, as German is closer-related to Swedish than Spanish is. \r\n\r\nAmendment XXXVI: The Eviction Notice\r\nParticularly crafty individuals may override a yet-to-be-made Shotgun call by leaving a note, clearly visible on the passenger-side door, with the word \"Shotgun\" written legibly on it, following the author's name. So long as no Shotgun call was made before the message was seen, the writer of the message is awarded Shotgun. \r\nOther calls relating to Shotgun may also be made in similar manner, including such calls as \"No Blitz\", \"Laser\", etc. \r\nThe execution of the written \"call\" goes into effect as soon as someone has seen the writing. Calls made prior to this override the note. \r\n\r\nAmendment XXXVII: No Hump\r\nLocal to Toronto, ON (Canada), this rule is relevant if there are five passengers in a car that has only four seats. After a successful Shotgun call is made, the remaining passengers may call \"No Hump\" to avoid sitting on the hump between the two back seats. The individual failing to make the call, or the last person to make the call, must sit on the uncomfortable, ball-breaking hump. This is a much-feared \"seat\" to Camaro and Firebird passengers. \r\n\r\nAmendment XXXVIII: Eagle Scout\r\nAn addition to Amendment XXX, it is the duty of the Shotgunner to spot all speed cameras and police cars that could pose a threat to the driver and car. If the vehicle is stopped because the Shotgunner failed in his duties, he may be banned from riding Shotgun for a period of time dictated by the driver. \r\n\r\nAmendment XXXIX: Shotgun Suicide\r\nIf the Shotgun caller attempts to open the car door as it is being unlocked (thus causing it to stay locked), he immediately loses Shotgun priviliges for the upcoming ride, and a new round of calling Shotgun must be executed. \r\n\r\nAmendment XXXX: Multiple Vehicles\r\nIn the case that there is more than one eligible car to make a trip, the owners of their respective vehicles may not want to drive. In these cases, they may force their colleagues to waste gas by proclaiming, \"Shot Not\". A successful call will not only save them gas, but will award them shotgun in another vehicle. \r\nIf there are more than two vehicles that can be driven, \"Shot Not\" can be followed by the name of the car's owner who the caller wants to have Shotgun in. \r\nIf \"Shot Not\" was called, but the car in which preference was called for has already had a successful Shotgun call, the individual still need not drive, so long as there are other potential vehicles whose drivers did not make successful \"Shot Not\" calls. \r\nOnce non-drivers have been eliminated with successful \"Shot Not\" calls, all non-Shotgun riding passengers may choose seats in the typical manner (ie \"Bitch\", \"Comm\", etc.) followed by the driver's name of the car they wish to travel in. A passenger is not guaranteed a particular seat in a vehicle unless the seat specified and the car specified is legal (ie, it has not yet been called). \r\n\"Shot Not\" may be called under the aliases of \"Shot No Drive\", \"Shotgun Not Drive\", and \"Shotgun No Drive\". \r\nFor efficiency-sake, \"Shot Not\" cannot be overriden with rules such as \"Laser\". \r\n\r\nAmendment XXXXI: Multiple Calls\r\nThis happens when multiple groups of people are meeting at one car, and both groups had someone claim Shotgun. If it can not be determined who made the call first, the dispute is settled with Rock, Paper, Scissors. \r\n\r\nAmendment XXXXII: Boyfriend/Girlfriend\r\nSection II, Article 3 of the Constitution states that , \"In the instance the driver's spouse, lover, partner, or hired prostitute for the evening is going to accompany the group, he/she is automatically given Shotgun, unless they decline.\" In addition, serious Boy/Girl friends should also receive preferential treatment in regards to shotgun.\r\n\r\nAmendment XXXXIII: The Couples Rule\r\nIn the event that a couple is traveling together, they must both sit together in either the front or back seat. This is so that people without boy/girlfriends, spouses, lovers, or prostitutes, can talk amongst themselves in the hope of acquiring boy/girlfriends, spouses, lovers, or prostitutes.\r\nThis rule however is null and void if the The No Chauffeur / Compulsory Shotgun Rule is in effect.\r\n\r\nAmendment XXXXIV: Balking\r\nIf you have called Shotgun and are waiting for the doors to be unlocked, you are not allowed to lift the handle during the unlocking, causing the other doors to remain locked. This voids your right to Shotgun.\r\n\r\nAmendment XXXXV: Abandonment\r\nIf the Shotgun occupant leaves the vehicle (even if they plan to come back), the Shotgun seat is up for grabs. One exception is if the Shotgun rider leaves to do a deed for the driver, like buying cigarettes or pumping gas. In those cases, that person retains their Shotgun rights. \r\n\r\nAmendment XXXXVI: The Handicapped\r\nSection II, Article 6 states that preferential shotgun treatment may be offered to anyone \"too wide or tall to fit comfortably in the back seat\". Preferential treatment should be awarded to the handicapped as well as to these genetic misfits, especially if the injury prevents them from achieving maximum leg room, maneuverability, etc. (as might be the case with a broken leg, foot, etc.) Unlike with Section II, Article 6, however, the handicapped are not to be taunted as with the genetic misfits if not awarded shotgun. Otherwise, taunting is okay. \r\n\r\nAmendment XXXXVII: The Bribery Amendment\r\nIn the event that the shotgun call ends up in a tie between two passengers, the passengers in the tie may attempt to bribe the driver so that the driver makes the call in their favor. This rule is null and void, however if the driver institutes the Survival of the Fittest Rules. Examples of bribes are money, food and soda.\r\n\r\nAmendment XXXXVIII: The Full View Amendment\r\nThe automobile must be in full view of all passengers before \"Shotgun\" may be called.\r\n\r\nAmendment XXXXIV: The Second Call Amendment\r\nIf a given passenger calls a valid \"shotgun\", then he or she may not say \"shotgun\" again. By calling \"shotgun\" a second time, he or she would automatically forfeit their seat and shotgun is reopened to the other passengers.\r\nOther passengers are allowed to try to trick the person who originally says \"shotgun\" into saying it again, in order to claim shotgun for themselves.\r\n\r\nAmendment L: Voiding\r\nWhenever you break a Shotgun rule, you may be voided from receiving Shotgun privileges for that ride. \r\n\r\nAmendment LI: Long Trips\r\nThe rules listed in our guide were created for short trips (1 hour or less). On longer trips, Shotgun can be divided equally among those who want it.\r\n\r\nAmendment LII: The Rock Amendment\r\nThis rule states that once a passenger calls \"Shotgun,\" he must also say, \"No Rock.\" If the gunner does not say this, another passenger may call, \"Rock.\" In this case Shotgun is awarded to the winner of a best of three, Rock, Paper, Scissors contest.\r\n\r\nAmendment LIII: The Rotating Shotgun Rule\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 This rule is native to a suburb of Philadelphia, PA to ensure that everybody gets shotgun at least once per long road trip. \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Before the first ride a passenger will call shotgun under the normal procedures, as stated in Section I of the Official Rules. \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Once a passenger has had shotgun, he or she may not have shotgun again until everyone else has had shotgun. \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Before the second ride, everyone (besides the person who has already had shotgun) competes for shotgun under the normal conditions. \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 This continues until the trip has either ended or if everyone has already had shotgun once. \r\nOnce everyone has had shotgun, the \"shotgun order\" has been established. You must now rotate in that order. \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The shotgun order recycles over and over until the trip is finished. \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Person(s) joining the trip after the first ride are entered into the order by the following process: \r\n----Clause A: On their first ride, the calling of gun is between that person and the person whose turn it is in the shotgun order. \r\n----Clause B: if the order has not yet been established, the new rider is entered into the pool of riders calling for shotgun. \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Driver still has final say in all ties and disputes. All rules from the Official rules, including special cases, and the Survival of the Fittest, are still in effect. \r\n\r\nAmendment LIV: The Barefoot Rule\r\nSince you must be outside to call Shotgun, some people will just grab their shoes, run outside, and call Shotgun before putting their shoes on. This is not valid. You must have your shoes on (if you plan to wear any) before you may call Shotgun. \r\nAmendment II: Re-entry \r\nIf you call Shotgun and then go back inside the building, you lose your Shotgun rights. While you are gone, someone else can call shotgun. If nobody does, you can call it when you go back. \r\n\r\nAmendment LV: Hand On The Shotgun Door\r\nShotgun can no longer be called once someone's hand is holding the shotgun door handle. This is significant when nobody else is around to hear you call shotgun. \r\n\r\nAmendment LVI: Sitting Down\r\nBy sitting in the Shotgun seat before anyone has called it, you get to stay there even if somebody calls it afterwards. Nobody needs to hear you actually call shotgun.",

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity that he ordered the preacher not to enter the donkey in another race. The paper headline read: BISHOP SCRATCHES PREACHER'S ASS. This was too much for the Bishop, so he ordered the preacher to get rid of the donkey. The preacher decided to give it to a nun in a nearby convent. The paper headline the next day read: NUN HAS BEST ASS IN TOWN. The Bishop fainted. He informed the nun that she would have to get rid of the donkey, so she sold it to a farmer for $10.00.\r\n\r\nThe next day the headline read: NUN SELLS ASS FOR $10.00. This was too much for the Bishop, so he ordered the nun to buy back the donkey, lead it to the plains, and let it go. Next day, the headline in the paper read: NUN ANNOUNCES HER ASS IS WILD AND FREE.

The solution: Eat it in the parking lot.\r\n\r\nDiet tip: Eat a chocolate bar before each meal. It'll take the edge off your appetite and you'll eat less.\r\n\r\nA nice box of chocolates can provide your total daily intake of calories in one place. Isn't that handy?\r\n\r\nIf you can't eat all your chocolate, it will keep in the freezer.\r\n\r\nBut if you can't eat all your chocolate, what's wrong with you?\r\n\r\nIf calories are an issue, store your chocolate on top of the fridge. Calories are afraid of heights, and they will jump out of the chocolate to protect themselves.\r\n\r\nIf I eat equal amounts of dark chocolate and white chocolate, is that a balanced diet? Don't they actually counteract each other?\r\n\r\nMoney talks. Chocolate sings.\r\n\r\nChocolate has many preservatives. Preservatives make you look younger.\r\n\r\nQ. Why is there no such organization as Chocoholics Anonymous? \r\nA. Because no one wants to quit.\r\n\r\nIf not for chocolate, there would be no need for control top pantyhose. An entire garment industry would be devastated.\r\n\r\nPut \"eat chocolate\" at the top of your list of things to do today. That way, at least you'll get one thing done.",

Just before the party started, two bums showed up looking for a handout. Feeling sorry for the bums, the woman told them that she would give them a meal if they will help chop some wood for her out back. Gratefully, they headed to the rear of the house.\r\n\r\nThe guests arrived, and all was going well with the children having a wonderful time. But the clown hadn't shown up. After a half and hour, the clown finally called to report that he was stuck in traffic, and would probably not make the party at all.\r\n\r\nThe woman was very disappointed and unsuccessfully tried to entertain the children herself. She happened to look out the window and saw one of the bums doing cartwheels across the lawn. She watched in awe as he swung from tree branches, did mid-air flips, and leaped high in the air.\r\n\r\nShe spoke to the other bum and said, \"What your friend is doing is absolutely marvelous. I have never seen such a thing. Do you think your friend would consider repeating this performance for the children at the party? I would pay him $50!\"\r\n\r\nThe other bum says, \"Well, I dunno. Let me ask him.\"\r\n\r\nHe yells, \"HEY WILLIE! FOR 50 DOLLARS, WOULD YOU CHOP OFF ANOTHER TOE?\"",

He spent the first few weeks of his retirement in peace and contentment.\r\n\r\nThen a new school year began. The very next afternoon three young boys, full of youthful, after-school enthusiasm, came down his street, beating merrily on every trash can they encountered.

Stopping them, he said, \"You kids are a lot of fun. I like to see you express your exuberance like that. In fact, I used to do the same thing when I was your age. Will you do me a favor? I'll give you each a dollar if you'll promise to come around every day and do your thing.\" The kids were elated and continued to do a bang-up job on the trash cans.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days, the old-timer greeted the kids again, but this time he had a sad smile on his face. \r\n\r\n\"This recession's really putting a big dent in my income,\" he told them. \"From now on, I'll only be able to pay you 50 cents to beat on the cans.\"\r\n\r\nThe noisemakers were obviously displeased, but they did accept his offer and continued their afternoon ruckus. A few days later, the wily retiree approached them again as they drummed their way down the street.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" he said, \"I haven't received my Social Security check yet, so I'm not going to be able to give you more than 25 cents.

The party of the first part (Lawyer) shall, with or without elevation at his option, by means of a chair, stepstool, ladder or any other means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and rotate the party of the second part (Light Bulb) in a counter-clockwise direction, said direction being non-negotiable. Said grasping and rotation of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) shall be undertaken by the party of the first part (Lawyer) with every possible caution by the party of the first part (Lawyer) to maintain the structural integrity of the party of the second part (Light Bulb), notwithstanding the afore-mentioned failure of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) to perform the aforementioned customary and agreed upon duties. The foregoing notwithstanding, however, both parties stipulate that structural failure of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) may be incidental to the aforementioned failure to perform and in such case the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall be held blameless for such structural failure insofar as this agreement is concerned so long as the non-negotiable directional codicil (counter-clockwise) is observed by the party of the first part (Lawyer) throughout.\r\n\r\n2.) Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part (Light Bulb) becomes separated from the party of the third part (\"Receptacle\"), the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of disposing of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable state, local and federal statutes.\r\n\r\n3.) Once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of beginning installation of the party of the fourth part(\"New Light Bulb\"). This installation shall occur in a manner consistent with the reverse of the procedures described in step one of this self- same document, being careful to note that the rotation should occur in a clockwise direction, said direction also being non-negotiable.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The above described steps may be performed, at the option of the party of the first part (Lawyer), by said party of the first part (Lawyer), by his heirs and assigns, or by any and all persons authorized by him to do so, the objective being to produce a level of illumination in the immediate vicinity of the aforementioned front (north) door consistent with maximization of ingress and revenue for the party of the fifth part, also known as \"The Firm\".",

Instead, run to their bed, jump up and dry yourself off on the sheets.\r\n\r\nThis is especially good if it's right before your human's bedtime.\r\n\r\n2. Act like a convicted criminal. When the humans come home, put your ears back, tail between your legs, chin down and act as if you have done something really bad. Then, watch as the humans frantically search the house for the damage they think you have caused.(Note: This only works when you have done absolutely nothing wrong.)\r\n\r\n3. Let the humans teach you a brand new trick. Learn it perfectly. Then the humans try to demonstrate it to someone else, stare blankly back at the humans. Pretend you have no idea what they're talking about.\r\n\r\n4. Make your humans be patient. When you go outside to go 'pee', sniff around the entire yard as your humans wait. Act as if the spot you choose to go pee will ultimately decide the fate of the earth.\r\n\r\n5. Draw attention to the human. When out for a walk always pick the busiest, most visible spot to go 'poo'. Take your time and make sure everyone watches. This works particularly well if your humans have forgotten to bring a plastic bag.\r\n\r\n6. When out for a walk, alternate between choking and coughing every time a strange human walks by.\r\n\r\n7. Make your own rules. Don't always bring back the stick when playing fetch with the humans. Make them go and chase it once in a while.\r\n\r\n8. Hide from your humans. When your humans come home, don't greet them at the door. Instead, hide from them, and make them think something terrible has happened to you. (Don't reappear until one of your humans is panic-stricken and close to tears).\r\n\r\n9. When your human calls you to come back in, always take your time. Walk as slowly as possible back to the door.\r\n\r\n10. Wake up twenty minutes before the alarm clock is set to go off and make the humans take you out for your morning pee.  As soon as you get back inside, fall asleep. (Humans can rarely fall back asleep after going outside, this will drive them nuts!)",

You could toast one-sided or double-sided. Successive slices would get lighter and lighter. The toaster would jam your bread for you. \r\n\r\nIf Radio Shack made toasters... The staff would sell you a toaster, but not know anything about it. Or you could buy all the parts to build your own toaster. \r\n\r\nIf Thinking Machines made toasters... You would be able to toast 64,000 pieces of bread at the same time. \r\n\r\nIf Cray made toasters... They would cost $16 million, but would be faster than any other single-slice toaster in the world. \r\n\r\nIf the Rand Corporation made toasters... It would be a large, perfectly smooth, and seamless black cube. Every morning there would be a piece of toast on top of it. Their service department would have an unlisted phone number, and the blueprints for the box would be highly classified, government documents.

The ToastMan, which would be barely larger than the single piece of bread it is meant to toast, and it could be conveniently attached to your belt. \r\n\r\nIf Timex made toasters... They would be cheap and small quartz-crystal wrist toasters that take a licking and keep on toasting. \r\n\r\nIf Fisher Price made toasters...

So the man walks and walks and eventually he comes upon a monastery.\r\n\r\nHe asks a monk at the monastery, \"Can I stay here over night? My car ran out of gas.\"\r\n\r\nThe monk replies, \"You may; but you musn't come out of your room between the hours of 12 midnight and 6 am.\"\r\n\r\nThe man replies, \"That's fine with me.\"  The monk takes him to his room, and the man falls asleep.\r\n\r\nAbout 12 midnight the man is roused from his sleep by a horrible groaning noise that was coming from the basement.  He gets out of his bed to see what it is, but remembers the monk saying that he couldn't leave his room between 12 and 6 am.  The groaning keeps the man awake all night long until it finally stops at 6.\r\n \r\nThe next morning the man asks the monk from yesterday, \"What was that racket coming from the basement?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't tell you. You're not a monk,\" the monk replies.\r\n\r\nSo the man gets some gas from the monk, fuels up his car and drives home. For a year that groaning noise haunts him. The man decides to become a monk so he can find out what it was.  \r\n\r\nThe man goes to monk school, and afterwards goes to the monastery that he arrived at a year ago.\r\n\r\nHe asks a monk there, \"Can I stay here for the night?\"\r\n\r\nThe monk replies, \"Yes, but do not come out of your room between the hours of 12 midnight and 6 am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" the man asks.\r\n\r\n\"I can't tell you.  You're not a monk,\" the monk replies.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am,\" the man says.\r\n\r\n\"Well, just don't come out,\" the monk says.\r\n\r\nThat night the man is awakened by the groaning noise.  The man thinks, 'I'm a monk, so I can go and see what it is. The man walks down to the first floor and opens the door to the basement.\r\n\r\nIt had been bugging him for sooo long what the groaning noise was in the basement. It had haunted his dreams, scared him in the day, and he had gone through monk school and everything JUST to see what the groaning noise was in the basement. It was a strange noise, and he was finally able to see what it was, after a whole 365 days. He was just so excited to know what it was, so he wouldn't be haunted anymore. So he went down to the basement, sighed, and slowly creaked the door open to see what he had been wanting to see for the longest time.\r\n\r\nDo you know what the man saw in the basement?

There were thousands of beautiful women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about. The sun was shining and the temperature was perfect.

While he's in the house, go find his sleigh and write him a speeding ticket. \r\n\r\n3.)  Leave him a note, explaining that you've gone away for the holidays. Ask if he would mind watering your plants. \r\n\r\n4.)  While he's in the house, replace all his reindeer with exact replicas. Then wait and see what happens when he tries to get them to fly. \r\n\r\n5.)  Keep an angry bull in your living room. If you think a bull goes crazy when he sees a little red cape, wait until he sees that big, red Santa suit! \r\n\r\n6.)  Build an army of mean-looking snowmen on the roof, holding signs that say \"We hate Christmas,\" and \"Go away Santa.\" \r\n\r\n7.)  Leave a note by the telephone, telling Santa that Mrs. Claus called and wanted to remind him to pick up some milk and a loaf of bread on his way home. \r\n\r\n8.)  While he's in the house, find the sleigh and sit in it. As soon as he comes back and sees you, tell him that he shouldn't have missed that last payment, and take off. \r\n\r\n9.)  Leave a plate filled with cookies and a glass of milk out, with a note that says, \"For The Tooth Fairy.\r\n\r\n10.) Leave another plate out with half a stale cookie and a few drops of skim milk in a dirty glass with a note that says, \"For Santa.\" \r\n\r\n11.) Take everything out of your house as if it's just been robbed and when Santa arrives, show up dressed like a policeman and say, \"Well, well.

Set a bear trap at the bottom of the chimney. Wait for Santa to get caught in it, and then explain that you're sorry, but from a distance, he looked like a bear. \r\n\r\n17.) Leave out a Santa suit, with a dry-cleaning bill. \r\n\r\n18.) Paint \"hoof-prints\" all over your face and clothes. While he's in the house, go out on the roof.

Wait for Santa to come and then say, \"This neighborhood ain't big enough for the both of us.\"",

As you may know, this seat is situated directly across from the lavatory, so close that I can reach out my left am and touch the door. \r\n\r\nAll my senses are being tortured simultaneously. It's difficult to say what the worst part about sitting in 29E really is. Is it the stench of the sanitation fluid that's blown all over my body every 60 seconds when the door opens? Is it the wooosh of the constant flushing? Or is it the passengers asses that seem to fit into my personal space like a pornographic jig-saw puzzle? \r\n\r\nI constructed a stink-shield by shoving one end of a blanket into the overhead compartment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 while effective in blocking at least some of the smell, and offering a small bit of privacy, the ass-on-my-body factor has increased, as without my evil glare, passengers feel free to lean up against what they think is some kind of blanketed wall. The next ass that touches my shoulder will be the last! \r\n\r\nI am picturing a board room full of executives giving props to the young promising engineer that figured out how to squeeze an additional row of seats onto this plane by putting them next to the LAV. I would like to flush his head in the toilet that I am close enough to touch, and taste, from my seat. \r\n\r\nPutting a seat here was a very bad idea. I just heard a man groan in there! This sucks! \r\n\r\nWorse yet, is I've paid over $400.00 for the honor of sitting in this seat! \r\n\r\nDoes your company give refunds? I'd like to go back where I came from and start over. Seat 29E could only be worse if it was located inside the bathroom. \r\n\r\nI wonder if my clothing will retain the sanitizing odor . . . what about my hair! I feel like I'm bathing in a toilet bowl of blue liquid, and there is no man in a little boat to save me. \r\n\r\nI am filled with a deep hatred for your plane designer and a general dis-ease that may last for hours. \r\n\r\nWe are finally decending, and soon I will be able to tear down the stink-shield, but the scars will remain. \r\n\r\nI suggest that you initiate immediate removal of this seat from all of your crafts. Just remove it, and leave the smouldering brown hole empty, a good place for sturdy/non-absorbing luggage maybe, but not human cargo.",

Suddenly look over at him/her, and say, \"You're one of THEM!\"\r\n\r\n6. Put down your book, and look at him/her.

Start arguing with yourself, then when he/she looks at you funny, say, \"Ohh, I'm sorry. I was just telling my subconscious to be quiet.\"\r\n\r\n14. Sit down, and then say to the person next to you, \"Hi! My name's (...) and I'm really glad to meet you.\"\r\n\r\n15. Ask him/her if he/she knew there are eddies in the space/time continuum.\r\n\r\n16. Ask him/her what species he/she is.\r\n\r\n17. Every so often, yelp in pain, and look at your feet.\r\n\r\n18. Bring a bag or purse, and peer into it and say, \"Got enough air in their?\" or, \"Settle down in there. I'm trying to read!\"\r\n\r\n19. Ask them what their name is, and then when they start to reply, cut them off by saying, \"No, it isn't!\"\r\n\r\n20. Break the silence by making a bodily function noise, then say, \"Wow!

IT'S A GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY! ALIENS BEAMED IT INTO MY BAG! IT'S BECAUSE I DIDN'T LET THEM DO EXPERIMENTS ON ME!\"\r\n\r\n46. Without looking away from your book, say to no one in particular, \"I know what you did last summer.\"\r\n\r\n47. Bring a piece of bread, and drop pieces of it down the little hole in the center of the table meant for cords.\r\n\r\n48.

When the person next to asked what is wrong, look at him/her with an inquiring look on your face, and say, \"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n60.

Start telling a VERY strange story, then half way through say, \"Never mind.\"\r\n\r\n62. Turn to them and while pointing your fingers at them as if you were electrocuting them, say, \"BUZZ!

Bye!\" and run off.\r\n\r\n67. Continuously rub a book while chanting, \"Come out, come out. I know you're in there!\" When they ask what you're doing, say, \"I'm calling the book genie out!\"\r\n\r\n68. Run up to them with a book, thrust it under their nose and ask, \"Will you sign my autograph?\" Make sure you say MY.\r\n\r\n69. Get up onto the table, and start acting like a duck.

Say, \"Oomph!\" like you were just shot, and while smushing a ketchup pack on your chest, fall on the floor. Then get back up like nothing happened. After that, look at your stomach, and say, \"What? How'd this stain get here?\" while motioning to the ketchup.",

Don't take the machine into the air unless you are satisfied it will fly.\r\n\r\n 2. Never leave the ground with the motor leaking.\r\n\r\n 3. Don't turn sharply when taxiing. Instead of turning sharp, have someone lift the tail around.\r\n\r\n 4. In taking off, look at the ground and the air.\r\n\r\n 5. Never get out of the machine with the motor running until the pilot relieving you can reach the motor controls.\r\n\r\n 6. Pilots should carry hankies in a handy place to wipe off goggles.\r\n\r\n 7. Riding on the steps, wings, or rail of the machine is prohibited.\r\n\r\n 8. In case the engine fails on takeoff, land straight ahead regardless of obstacles.\r\n\r\n 9. No machine must taxi faster than a man can walk.\r\n\r\n 10. Never run motor so that blast will blow on other machines.\r\n\r\n 11. Learn to gauge altitude, especially on landing.\r\n\r\n 12. If you see another machine near you, get out of the way.\r\n\r\n 13. No two cadets should ever ride together in the same machine.\r\n\r\n 14. Do not trust altitude instruments.\r\n\r\n 15. Before you begin a landing glide, see that no machines are under you.\r\n\r\n 16. Hedge-hopping will not be tolerated.\r\n\r\n 17. No spins on back or tail sides will be indulged in as they unnecessarily strain the machines.\r\n\r\n 18. If flying against the wind and you wish to fly with the wind, don't make a sharp turn near the ground. You may crash.\r\n\r\n 19. Motors have been known to stop during a long glide. If pilot wishes to use motor for landing, he should open the throttle.\r\n\r\n 20. Don't attempt to force the machine onto the ground with more than flying speed. The result is bounding and ricocheting.\r\n\r\n 21. Pilots will not wear spurs while flying.\r\n\r\n 22. Do not use aeronautical gasoline in cars or motorcycles.\r\n\r\n 23. You must not take off or land closer than 50 feet to the hanger.\r\n\r\n 24. Never take a machine into the air until you are familiar with it's controls and instruments.\r\n\r\n 25.

Jay went into the audience to find the most embarrassing first date that a woman ever had. The winner described her worst first date experience. There absolutely no question as to why her tale took the prize! \r\n\r\nShe said it was midwinter, snowing and quite cold; and the guy had taken her skiing to Lake Arrowhead. It was a day trip (no overnight). They were strangers, after all, and truly had never met before. The outing was fun but relatively uneventful until they were headed home late that afternoon. They were driving back down the mountain, when she gradually began to realize that she should not have had that extra latte. \r\n\r\nThey were about an hour away from anywhere with a rest room and in the middle of nowhere! Her companion suggested she try to hold it, which she did for a while. Unfortunately, because of the heavy snow and slow going, there came a point where she told him that he had better stop and let her pee beside the road, or it would be the front seat of his car. They stopped and she quickly crawled out beside the car, yanked her pants down and started. Unfortunately, in the deep snow she didn't have good footing, so she let her butt rest against the rear fender to steady herself. Her companion stood on the side of the car watching for traffic and indeed was a real gentleman and refrained from peeking. \r\n\r\nAll she could think about was the relief she felt despite the rather embarrassing nature of the situation. Upon finishing however, she soon became aware of another sensation. As she bent to pull up her pants, the young lady discovered her buttocks were firmly glued against the car's fender. Thoughts of tongues frozen to pump handles immediately came to mind as she attempted to disengage her flesh from the icy metal. It was quickly apparent that she had a brand new problem due to the extreme cold.\r\n\r\nHorrified by her plight and yet aware of the humor she answered her date's concerns about \"what is taking so long?\" with a reply that indeed, she was \"freezing her butt off and in need of some assistance\"! He came around the car as she tried to cover herself with her sweater and then, as she looked imploringly into his eyes, he burst out laughing. She too, got the giggles and when they finally managed to compose themselves, they assessed her dilemma. Obviously, as hysterical as the situation was, they also were faced with a real problem. \r\n\r\nBoth agreed it would take something hot to free her chilly cheeks from the grip of the icy metal! Thinking about what had gotten her into the predicament in the first place, both quickly realized that there was only one way to get her free. So, as she looked the other way, her first-time date proceeded to unzip his pants and pee her butt off the fender. As for the Tonight Show; she took the prize hands down - or perhaps that should be \"pants down.\" And you thought your first date was embarrassing. Jay Leno's comment? This gives a whole new meaning to being \"pissed off.\"",

The Stella's are named after 81-year-old Stella Liebeck who spilled coffee on herself and successfully sued McDonalds. That case inspired the Stella Awards for the most frivolous successful lawsuits in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe following are this year's candidates:\r\n\r\n1. Kara Walton of Claymont, Delaware, successfully sued the owner of a nightclub in a neighboring city when she fell from the bathroom window to the floor and knocked out her two front teeth. This occurred while Ms. Walton was trying to sneak through the window in the ladies room to avoid paying the $3.50 cover charge. She was awarded $12,000 and dental expenses.\r\n\r\n2. Jerry Williams of Little Rock, Arkansas, was awarded $14,500 and medical expenses after being bitten on the buttocks by his next-door neighbor's beagle. The beagle was on a chain in its owner's fenced yard. The award was less than sought because the jury felt the dog might have been just a little provoked at the time by Mr. Williams who was shooting it repeatedly with a pellet gun.\r\n\r\n3. A 19-year-old Carl Truman of Los Angeles won $74,000 and medical expenses when his neighbor ran over his hand with a Honda Accord. Mr. Truman apparently didn't notice there was someone at the wheel of the car when he was trying to steal his neighbor's hub caps.\r\n\r\n4. A Philadelphia restaurant was ordered to pay Amber Carson of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, $113,500 a! after she slipped on a soft drink spill and broke her coccyx (tailbone). The beverage was on the floor because Ms. Carson had thrown it at her boyfriend 30 seconds earlier during an argument.\r\n\r\n5. Terrence Dickson of Bristol, Pennsylvania, was leaving a house he had just finished robbing by way of the garage. He was not able to get the garage door to go up since the automatic door opener was malfunctioning. He couldn't reenter the house because the door connecting the house and garage locked when he pulled it shut. The family was on vacation, and Mr. Dickson found himself locked in the garage for eight days. He subsisted on a case of Pepsi he found and a large bag of dry dog food. He sued the homeowner's insurance claiming the situation caused him undue mental anguish. The jury agreed to the tune of $500,000.\r\n\r\n6. A jury of her peers awarded Kathleen Robertson of Austin, Texas, $780,000 after breaking her ankle by tripping over a toddler who was running inside a furniture store. The owners of the store were understandably surprised at the verdict, considering the misbehaving little toddler was Ms. Robertson's son.\r\n\r\n7. This year's favorite could easily be Mr. Merv Grazinski of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Mr. Grazinski purchased a brand new 32-foot Winnebago motor home. On his first trip home, having driven onto the freeway, he set the cruise control at 70 mph and calmly left the drivers seat to go into the back and make himself a cup of coffee. Not surprisingly, the R.V. left the freeway, crashed and overturned. Mr. Grazinski sued Winnebago for not advising him in the owner's manual that he couldn't actually do this. The jury awarded him $1,750,000 plus a new motor home. The company actually changed their manuals on the basis of this suit, just in case there were any other complete morons buying their recreation vehicles.",

The probability of the latter increases with the number of people you tell about the former.\r\n\r\nLAW 3: Brand new golf balls are water-magnetic.

If one does, the tree is breaking a law of the universe and should be cut down.\r\n\r\nLAW 5: No matter what causes a golfer to muff a shot, all his playing partners must solemnly chant, \"You looked up,\" or invoke the wrath of the universe.\r\n\r\nLAW 6: The higher a golfer's handicap, the more qualified he deems himself as an instructor.\r\n\r\nLAW 7: Every par-three hole in the world has a secret desire to humiliate golfers.

        "body": "Dear Mom and Dad,\r\n\r\n\r\nOur scoutmaster told us all to write to our parents in case you saw the flood on TV and worried. We are OK. Only one of our tents and two of our sleeping bags got washed away. Luckily none us got drowned because we were all up on the mountain looking for Chad when it happened.\r\n\r\nOh yes, please call Chad's mother and tell her he is OK. He can't write because of the cast. I got to ride in one of the search and rescue jeeps. It was neat. We never would have found him in the dark if it hadn't been for the lightning. Scoutmaster Long got mad at Chad for going on a hike alone without telling anyone. Chad said he did tell him, but it was during the fire so he probably didn't hear him. Don't worry it didn't hurt anything very much, just burned part of the chow hall. Scoutmaster Long said we will have to wash the black stuff off of the meat that used to be in the cooler but he said it would be alright. Did you know that if you put gas on a fire, the gas can will blow up? The wet wood still didn't burn, but one of our tents did. Also some of our clothes. John is going to look weird until his hair grows back.\r\n\r\nWe will come home on Saturday if Scoutmaster Long gets the car fixed. It wasn't his fault about the wreck. The brakes worked OK when we left. Scoutmaster Long said that with a car that old, you have to expect something to break down; that's probably why he can't get insurance on it. We think it's a neat car. He doesn't care if we get it dirty, and if it's hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate. It gets pretty hot with ten people in the car. He let us take turns riding in the trailer until the highway patrolman stopped and talked to us. Scoutmaster Long is a neat guy. Don't worry, he is a good driver. Especially when that wheel came off when we were going around this steep curve. In fact, he is teaching Terry how to drive. He only lets him drive on them mountain roads where there isn't any traffic. All we ever see up there are logging trucks. I'm glad Terry wasn't driving when the wheel came off. We probably would have went off the cliff.\r\n\r\nThis morning all the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out in the lake. Scoutmaster Long wouldn't let me because I can't swim and Chad was afraid he would sink because of the cast, so he let us take the canoe across the lake. It was great. You can still see some of the trees under the water from the flood. Scoutmaster Long isn't crabby like some scoutmasters. He didn't even get mad about the life jackets. When I can I will tell you how we lost them. He has to spend a lot of time working on the car so we are trying not to cause him any trouble.\r\n\r\nGuess what? We have passed all our first aid merit badges. When Dave dove in the lake and cut his arm, we all got to see how a tourniquet works. Also, Wade and I threw up. Scoutmaster Long said it was probably just food poisoning from the leftover chicken. He said they got sick that way sometimes from the food they ate in prison. I'm so glad he got out and became our scoutmaster.\r\n\r\nHe said he sure figured out how to get things done while he was doing his time.\r\n\r\nI have to go now, we are going to town to mail our letters and buy bullets. Scoutmaster Long has a big pistol and he is going to teach us how to shoot it. The reason we have to buy more bullets is Jimmy threw all of the others in the fire. It sure was a loud noise. It was neat though, it sounded like a bunch of bees flying out of the fire. Scoutmaster Long said not to tell any one because some of the tents got holes in them from the bullets and he said he is not supposed to have a gun but he didn't say why. Don't worry we put duct tape over the holes in the tents. Scoutmaster Long says that is the best stuff to fix anything. He should know, the seats in his old car has it all over them, so does the dash.\r\n\r\nDon't worry about anything. We are fine.\r\nLove, Cole \r\n\r\nP.S.

Go up to random people and ask \"How are you doing?\" See what kind of conversation you can start.\r\n(I met lots of new people this way)\r\n\r\n2.  Ask someone what another person's name is nearby.  Go up to that person and say \"Hey, *person's name*.  How are you? You forgot my name, again, didn't you!?\" (People normally look at me very confused with this one.)\r\n\r\n3.  Fall down in front of strangers, and see if they try to help. (If they don't help, I yell out, \"FINE! DON'T HELP ME THEN!\")\r\n\r\n4.  Bump into someone and pretend it causes you to fall down. See if they apologize. (This is hard to do, because they normally try to avoid me when I try to bump them.)\r\n\r\n5.  Walk behind someone until he/she turns around. Then say, \"What?\" (You should look very confused, so it makes them be confused also.)\r\n\r\n6.  Run around and jump on things and make noises pretending to be a monkey.\r\n(It works with any animal.)\r\n\r\n7.  Put water in your mouth, and pretend you are barfing when someone walks by. (It's really funny when you chew up some Snickers for this.)\r\n\r\n8.  Get an \"Obsession, for men\" cologne sample spray, and go up to people asking,  \"Do you have an obsession for men?  I was just wondering because I have an obsession for me.  It's in my pants.  Do you want me to spray you with it?\"  When they look at you funny, take out the cologne and say \"What? It's just my obsession for men cologne. What were you thinking of?\" (It doesn't work on the people that have the cologne.)\r\n\r\n9.  Walk behind someone and have an arguement with yourself. (It's even better if you talk in two different voices.)\r\n\r\n10. Have a bottle of water and go up to people saying, \"Thirsty?\" (I got a total of 5 people to drink from my bottle.)\r\n\r\n11. Have a newspaper or a book (or something like that) and hold it out to someone and ask, \"Thirsty?\" (Confusion is funny.)\r\n\r\n12. Put a chunk of something sticky on your hand, and go up to people saying, \"Hey, how're you doing?\" and try to shake their hand. (Some people actually don't notice huge sticky brown things sticking to your hand.)\r\n\r\n13. Jump kick a wall and look at someone and say, \"Please don't do that.\" (It works with trees too.)\r\n\r\n14. Go up to someone and say in a very low voice, \"Death by catapult.\" (There is also, death by spatula, death by rug burn, death by malapropism, or any other weird random way of death.)\r\n\r\n15. Get people to join you in your strange adventures. (Twice the people = twice the fun.)\r\n\r\nBe careful about the people you do these things to.  Have fun. :-D",

Like many young men, then and now, the boy didn't really know what he wanted to do - and he didn't seem overly concerned about it.\r\n\r\nOne day, while the boy was away at school, his father decided to try an experiment. What he did was, he went into the boy's room and placed on his study table these three objects: a Bible, a silver dollar, and a bottle of whiskey...\r\n\r\n\"Now then,\" the old preacher said to himself, \"I'll just hide behind the door here, and when my son comes home from school this afternoon, I'll see which of these three objects he picks up. If he picks up the Bible, he's going to be a preacher like me, and what a blessing that would be! If he picks up the dollar, he's going to be a businessman, and that would be o.k. too. But if he picks up the bottle, he's going to be a drunkard - a no-good drunkard and Lord, what a shame that would be.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man was anxious as he waited, and soon he heard his son's footsteps as he came in the house whistling and headed back to his room. He deposited his books on the bed, as a matter of routine, and as he turned around to leave the room he spotted the objects on the table.\r\n\r\nWith a curious set in his eye, he walked over to inspect them. What he finally did was, he picked up the Bible and placed it under his arm. He picked up the silver dollar and dropped it into his pocket. He uncorked the bottle and took a big drink...\r\n\r\n\"Lord have mercy,\" the old man whispered, \"He's gonna be a politician!\"",

        "body": "NEWSPAPERS: If you have to go to the bathroom while playing in the front yard, always use the newspaper that's placed in the driveway every morning for that purpose. \r\n\r\nVISITORS: Quickly determine which guest is afraid of dogs. Charge across the room, barking loudly and leap playfully on this person. If the human falls down on the floor and starts crying, lick its face and growl gently to show your concern.\r\n\r\nBARKING: Because you are a dog, you are expected to bark. So bark -- a lot. Your owners will be very happy to hear you protecting their house. Especially late at night while they are sleeping safely in their beds. There is no more secure feeling for a human than to keep waking up in the middle of the night and hearing your protective bark, bark, bark... \r\n\r\nLICKING: Always take a BIG drink from your water dish immediately before licking your human. Humans prefer clean tongues. Be ready to fetch your human a towel. \r\n\r\nHOLES: Rather than digging a BIG hole in the middle of the yard and upsetting your human, dig a lot of smaller holes all over the yard so they won't notice. If you arrange a little pile of dirt on one side of each hole, maybe they'll think it's gophers. There are never enough holes in the ground. Strive daily to do your part to help correct this problem. \r\n\r\nDOORS: The area directly in front of a door is always reserved for the family dog to sleep. \r\n\r\nTHE ART OF SNIFFING: Humans like to be sniffed. Everywhere. It is your duty, as the family dog, to accommodate them. \r\n\r\nDINING ETIQUETTE: Always sit under the table at dinner, especially when there are guests, so you can clean up any food that falls on the floor. It's also a good time to practice your sniffing. \r\n\r\nHOUSEBREAKING: Housebreaking is very important to humans, so break as much of the house as possible. \r\n\r\nGOING FOR WALKS: Rules of the road: When out for a walk with your master or mistress, never go to the bathroom on your own lawn. \r\n\r\nCOUCHES: It is perfectly permissible to lie on the new couch after all your humans have gone to bed. \r\n\r\nPLAYING: If you lose your footing while chasing a ball or stick, use the flower bed to absorb your fall so you don't injure yourself. \r\n\r\nCHASING CATS: When chasing cats, make sure you never--- quite--- catch them. It spoils all the fun. \r\n\r\nCHEWING: Make a contribution to the fashion industry. ...Eat a shoe.",

Mrs. Smith replied, \"Yes, he is my husband.\" Well that set off a torrent of accolades about how knowledgeable Mr. Smith was about the subject matter he was teaching, about how he got the whole class to discuss their fears about learning the subject. Well Mrs. Smith was taken back by what she heard from these girls and replied, \"I don't know how you find him to be so gifted at teaching you this course. You know he only tried it twice in his life. The first time he tried it, he got sick, and the second time, his hat blew off and he just quit.\"",

Before or after he died?\r\n --------\r\nQ. Officer, what led you to believe the defendant was under the influence?\r\nA. Because he was argumentary and he couldn't pronunciate his words.\r\n --------\r\nTHE COURT: Now, as we begin, I must ask you to banish all present \r\ninformation\r\nand prejudice from your minds, if you have any.\r\n --------\r\nQ. Did he pick the dog up by the ears?\r\nA. No.\r\nQ. What was he doing with the dog's ears?\r\nA. Picking them up in the air.\r\nQ. Where was the dog at this time?\r\nA.

Could you see him from where you were standing?\r\nA. I could see his head.\r\nQ. And where was his head?\r\nA. Just above his shoulders.\r\n --------\r\nQ. What can you tell us about he truthfulness and veracity of this \r\ndefendant?\r\nA. Oh, she will tell the truth. She said she'd kill that sonofabitch - and\r\nshe did!\r\n --------\r\nQ.

The London hotel involved submitted this to the Sunday Times. No name was mentioned.\r\n \r\n \r\n       WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THOSE \"FREE\" SOAPS WHEN TRAVELLING\r\n \r\n    Dear Maid,\r\n    Please do not leave any more of those little bars of soap in my bathroom since I have brought my own bath-sized Dial. Please remove the six unopened little bars from the shelf under the medicine chest and another three in the shower soap dish. They are in my way. Thank you,\r\n                                             S. Berman\r\n \r\n \r\n -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n \r\n    Dear Room 635,\r\n    I am not your regular maid. She will be back tomorrow, Thursday, from her day off. I took the 3 hotel soaps out of the shower soap dish as you requested. The 6 bars on your shelf I took out of your way and put on top of your Kleenex dispenser in case you should change your mind. This leaves only the 3 bars I left today which my instructions from the management is to leave 3 soaps daily.\r\n    I hope this is satisfactory.\r\n                                             Kathy, Relief Maid\r\n \r\n \r\n -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n \r\n    Dear Maid - I hope you are my regular maid.\r\n    Apparently, Kathy did not tell you about my note to her concerning the little bars of soap. When I got back to my room this evening I found you had added 3 little Camays to the shelf under my medicine cabinet.\r\n    I am going to be here in the hotel for two weeks and have brought my own bath-size Dial so I won't need those 6 little Camays which are on the shelf. They are in my way when shaving, brushing teeth, etc.\r\n    Please remove them.\r\n                                             S. Berman\r\n \r\n \r\n -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n \r\n    Dear Mr. Berman,\r\n    My day off was last Wed. so the relief maid left 3 hotel soaps which we are instructed by the management. I took the 6 soaps which were in your way on the shelf and put them in the soap dish where your Dial was. I put the Dial in the medicine cabinet for your convenience. I didn't remove the 3 complimentary soaps which are always placed inside the medicine cabinet for all new check-ins and which you did not object to when you checked in last Monday.  Please let me know if I can of further assistance.\r\n                                             Your regular maid,\r\n                                             Dotty\r\n \r\n \r\n -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n \r\n \r\n    Dear Mr. Berman,\r\n    The assistant manager, Mr. Kensedder, informed me this a.m. that you called him last evening and said you were unhappy with your maid service. I have assigned a new girl to your room. I hope you will accept my apologies for any past inconvenience. If you have any future complaints please contact me so I can give it my personal attention. Call extension 1108 between 8 a.m. and 5p.m. Thank you.\r\n                                             Elaine Carmen\r\n                                             Housekeeper\r\n \r\n \r\n -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n \r\n    Dear Miss Carmen,\r\n    It is impossible to contact you by phone since I leave the hotel for business at 7.45 a.m. and don't get back before 5.30 or 6 p.m. That's the reason I called Mr. Kensedder last night. You were already off duty.\r\n    I only asked Mr. Kensedder if he could do anything about those little bars of soap. The new maid you assigned me must have thought I was a new check-in today, since she left another 3 bars of hotel soap in my medicine cabinet along with her regular delivery of 3 bars on the bathroom shelf. In just 5 days here I have accumulated 24 little bars of soap. Why are you doing this to me?\r\n                                             S. Berman\r\n \r\n \r\n -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n \r\n    Dear Mr. Berman,\r\n    Your maid, Kathy, has been instructed to stop delivering soap to your room and remove the extra soaps.  If I can be of further assistance, please call extension 1108 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Thank you,\r\n                                             Elaine Carmen,\r\n                                             Housekeeper\r\n \r\n \r\n -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n \r\n    Dear Mr. Kensedder,\r\n    My bath-size Dial is missing. Every bar of soap was taken from my room including my own bath-size Dial. I came in late last night and had to call the bellhop to bring me 4 little Cashmere Bouquets.\r\n                                             S. Berman\r\n \r\n \r\n -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n \r\n    Dear Mr. Berman,\r\n    I have informed our housekeeper, Elaine Carmen, of your soap problem.\r\n    I cannot understand why there was no soap in your room since our maids are instructed to leave 3 bars of soap each time they service a room. The situation will be rectified immediately. Please accept my apologies for the inconvenience.\r\n                                     Martin L. Kensedder\r\n                                             Assistant Manager\r\n \r\n \r\n -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n \r\n \r\n    Dear Mrs. Carmen,\r\n    Who the hell left 54 little bars of Camay in my room?  I came in last night and found 54 little bars of soap. I don't want 54 little bars of Camay. I want my one damn bar of bath-size Dial. Do you realize I have 54 bars of soap in here? All I want is my bath size Dial.\r\n    Please give me back my bath-size Dial.\r\n                                             S. Berman\r\n \r\n \r\n -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n \r\n    Dear Mr. Berman,\r\n    You complained of too much soap in your room so I had them removed.\r\n    Then you complained to Mr. Kensedder that all your soap was missing so I personally returned them. The 24 Camays which had been taken and the 3 Camays you are supposed to receive daily (sic). I don't know anything about the 4 Cashmere Bouquets. Obviously your maid, Kathy, did not know I had returned your soaps so she also brought 24 Camays plus the 3 daily Camays. I don't know where you got the idea this hotel issues bath-size Dial. I was able to locate some bath-size Ivory which I left in your room.\r\n                                             Elaine Carmen\r\n                                             Housekeeper\r\n \r\n \r\n -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n \r\n    Dear Mrs. Carmen,\r\n    Just a short note to bring you up-to-date on my latest soap inventory.\r\n \r\n    As of today I possess:\r\n \r\n    - On shelf under medicine cabinet - 18 Camay in 4 stacks of 4 and 1 stack of 2.\r\n    - On Kleenex dispenser - 11 Camay in 2 stacks of 4 and 1 stack of 3.\r\n    - On bedroom dresser - 1 stack of 3 Cashmere Bouquet, 1 stack of 4 hotel-size Ivory, and 8 Camay in 2 stacks of 4.\r\n    - Inside medicine cabinet - 14 Camay in 3 stacks of 4 and 1 stack of 2.\r\n    - In shower soap dish - 6 Camay, very moist.\r\n    - On northeast corner of tub - 1 Cashmere Bouquet, slightly used.\r\n    - On northwest corner of tub - 6 Camays in 2 stacks of 3.\r\n \r\n    Please ask Kathy when she services my room to make sure the stacks are neatly piled and dusted. Also, please advise her that stacks of more than 4 have a tendency to tip. May I suggest that my bedroom window sill is not in use and will make an excellent spot for future soap deliveries. One more item, I have purchased another bar of bath-sized Dial which I am keeping in the hotel vault in order to avoid further misunderstandings.\r\n                                            S.

As the successor to DOS, which has over 10,000,000 systems in use, it creates incredible opportunities for everyone involved with PCs.\"\r\n\r\nBill Gates, Free Market and the LA Times Thanks GC!\r\n\"There are people who don't like capitalism, and people who don't like PCs. But there's no-one who likes the PC who doesn't like Microsoft\" \r\n\r\nFrom the back of an old Digitalk Smalltalk/V PM manual, 1990:\r\n\"This is the right way to develop applications for OS/2 PM. OS/2 PM is a tremendously rich environment, which makes it inherently complex. Smalltalk/V PM removes that complexity and lets you concentrate on writing great programs. Smalltalk/V PM is the kind of tool that will make OS/2 the successor to MS/DOS\".\r\n\r\nfrom \"OS/2 Notebook\", Microsoft Press, (c) 1990 - an excerpt from an interview with Bill Gates and Jim Cannavino, p. 614:\r\nDeveloper: Does the announcement [of the OS/2 joint development agreement between IBM and Microsoft] mean that Microsoft is curtailing any plans for future development of Windows?\r\nGates: Microsoft has not changed any of its plans for Windows. It is obvious that we will not include things like threads and preemptive multitasking in Windows. By the time we added that, you would have OS/2.\r\n\r\nThere's a reason they threw it away...\r\nfrom \"Programmers at Work\" by Microsoft Press, interview with Bill (found on comp.os.os2.advocacy),\r\nInterviewer: Is studying computer science the best way to prepare to be a programmer?\r\n\r\nGates: No, the best way to prepare is to write programs, and to study great programs that other people have written. In my case, I went to the garbage cans at the Computer Science Center and I fished out listings of their operating system.\r\n\r\nOnly the finest Microsoft marketing! (submitted by BarryB):\r\n\"If you don't know what you need Windows NT for, you don't need it.\" \r\n\r\nOn the Box of Windows 2.11 for 286 (submitted by GLDM)\r\n\"New interface closely resembles Presentation Manager, preparing you for the wonders of OS/2!\"\r\n\r\nOn code stability, from Focus Magazine (submitted by Benedikt Heinen Microsoft programs are generally bug-free. If you visit the Microsoft hotline, you'll literally have to wait weeks if not months until someone calls in with a bug in one of our programs. 99.99% of calls turn out to \r\nbe user mistakes.\r\n[...] \r\nI know not a single less irrelevant reason for an update than bugfixes. The reasons for updates are to present more new features.\r\n\r\nUnconfirmed quotes:\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's GUI innovations... 1983 (thanks E.R.)\r\n\"Imagine the disincentive to software development if after months of work another company could come along and copy your work and market it under its own name...without legal restraints to such copying, companies like Apple could not afford to advance the state of the art.\"\r\n\r\nEven more 1984 predictions (thanks Scott Renyen)\r\n\"The next generation of interesting software will be made on a Macintosh, not an IBM PC.\"",

        "body": "Justification for beer and ice cream! But stay away from the pizza!\r\n\r\nAs we all know, it takes 1 calorie to heat 1 gram of water 1 degree centigrade. Translated into meaningful terms, this means that if you eat a very cold dessert (generally consisting of water in large part), the natural processes which raise the consumed dessert to body temperature during the digestive cycle literally suck the calories out of the only available source, your body fat.\r\n\r\nFor example, a dessert served and eaten at near 0 degrees C (32.2 deg. F) will, in a short time, be raised to the normal body temperature of 37 degrees C (98.6 deg. F).  For each gram of dessert eaten, that process takes approximately 37 calories as stated above.  The average dessert portion is 6 oz, or 168 grams.  Therefore, by operation of thermodynamic law, 6,216 calories (1 cal./gm/deg. x 37 deg. x 168 gms) are extracted from body fat as the dessert's temperature is normalized.\r\n\r\nAllowing for the 1,200 latent calories in the dessert, the net calorie loss is approximately 5,000 calories.\r\n\r\nObviously, the more cold dessert you eat,the better off you are and the faster you will lose weight, if that is your goal.\r\n\r\nThis process works equally well when drinking very cold beer in frosted glasses.  Each ounce of beer contains 16 latent calories, but extracts 1,036 calories (6,216 cal. per 6 oz. portion) in the temperature normalizing process.  Thus the net calorie loss per ounce of beer is 1,020 calories.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to calculate that 12,240 calories (12 oz. x 1,020 cal./oz.) are extracted from the body in the process of drinking a can of beer.\r\n\r\nFrozen desserts, e.g., ice cream, are even more beneficial, since it takes 83 cal./gm to melt them (i.e., raise them to 0 deg. C) and an additional 37 cal./gm to further raise them to body temperature. The results here are really remarkable, and it beats running hands down.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, for those who eat pizza as an excuse to drink beer, pizza (loaded with latent calories and served above body temperature) induces an opposite effect.  But, thankfully, as the astute reader should have already reasoned, the obvious solution is to drink a lot of beer with pizza and follow up immediately with large bowls of ice cream.\r\n\r\nWe could all be thin if we were to adhere religiously to a pizza, beer, and ice cream diet.\r\n\r\nHappy eating!",

Six feet eight, built like a wrestler, arms hanging down to the ground. He glared at the driver and said, \"Big John doesn't pay!\" and sat down at the back. Did I mention that the driver was five feet three, thin, and basically meek? Well, he was. Naturally, he didn't argue with Big John, but he wasn't happy about it.\r\n\r\nThe next day the same thing happened-Big John got on again, made a showoff refusing to pay, and sat down. And the next day, and the one after that, and so forth. This grated on the bus driver, who started losing sleepo ver the way Big John was taking advantage of him.\r\n\r\nFinally he could stand it no longer. He signed up for body building courses, karate, judo, and all that good stuff. By the end of the summer, he had become quite strong & invested a lot of money as well ; what's more, he felt really good about himself.\r\n\r\nSo on the next Monday, when Big John once again got on the bus and said,\" Big John doesn't pay!,\" the driver stood up, glared back at the passenger, and screamed, \"And why not?\"  With a surprised look on his face, Big John replied, \r\n\"Big John has a bus pass !\"\r\n\r\nMoral of the story:--  Be sure there is a problem in the first place before working hard to solve one",

Still, a job's a job, he thought.\r\n\r\nAs he went about his route, he stopped and picked up twin girls. These girls were rather portly, and as they entered the bus the first one said, \"My name's Patty.\" The man asked the second twin her name and she said, \"My name's Patty also.\"\r\n\r\nFurther along, there was a boy who was trying to put on a James Dean-esque cool image.

I'm Leonard T.\" He sat in the seat right behind the driver, so the driver could see him in his mirror.\r\n\r\nThey were almost back to the school, and made one last stop. The kid who got on announced, \"I'm Ross... and I'm special.\"\r\n\r\nAs they made their way back to the school, the driver noticed to his disgust that the kid sitting right behing him had removed one shoe to reveal a horrible case of bunions, which he was picking at.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they got to school, the man went to the principal's office, threw down the bus keys on his desk, and announced he was quitting. \"Is something wrong?\" asked the principal?\r\n\r\n\"I can't take this!\" yelled the man. \"I've got two all beef Pattys, special Ross, Leonard T. picking bunions on a Sesame Street bus!\"",

        "body": "I probably shouldn't admit this to you younger readers, but when my generation was your age, we did some pretty stupid things. I'm talking about taking CRAZY risks. We drank water right from the tap. We used aspirin bottles that you could actually open with your bare hands. We bought appliances that were not festooned with helpful safety warnings such as \"DO NOT BATHE WITH THIS TOASTER\".\r\n\r\nBut for sheer insanity, the wildest thing we did was -- prepare to be shocked -- we deliberately ingested carbohydrates.\r\n\r\nI know, I know. It was wrong. But we were young and foolish, and there was a lot of peer pressure. You'd be at a party, and there would be a lava lamp blooping away, and a Jimi Hendrix record playing (a \"record\" was a primitive compact disc that operated by static electricity). And then, when the mood was right, somebody would say: \"You wanna do some 'drates?\" And the next thing you know, there'd be a bowl of pretzels going around, or crackers, or even potato chips, and we'd put these things into our mouths and just ... EAT them.\r\n\r\nI'm not proud of this. My only excuse was that we were ignorant. It's not like now, when everybody knows how bad carbohydrates are, and virtually every product is advertised as being \"low-carb\", including beer, denture adhesives, floor wax, tires, life insurance and Viagra. Back then, we had no idea. Nobody did! Our own MOTHERS gave us bread!\r\n\r\nToday, of course, nobody eats bread. People are terrified of all carbohydrates, as evidenced by the recent mass robbery at a midtown Manhattan restaurant, where 87 patrons turned their wallets over to a man armed only with a strand of No. 8 spaghetti. (\"Do what he says! He has pasta!\") The city of Beverly Hills has been evacuated twice this month because of reports -- false, thank heavens -- that terrorists had put a bagel in the water supply.\r\n\r\nBut as I say, in the old days we didn't recognize the danger of carbohydrates. We believed that the reason you got fat was from eating \"calories\", which are tiny units of measurement that cause food to taste good. When we wanted to lose weight, we went on low-calorie diets in which we ate only inedible foods such as celery, which is actually a building material, and grapefruit, which is nutritious, but offers the same level of culinary satisfaction as chewing on an Odor Eater.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the low-calorie diet was that a normal human could stick to it for, at most, four hours, at which point he or she would have no biological choice but to sneak out to the garage and snork down an entire bag of Snickers, sometimes without removing the wrappers. So nobody lost weight, and everybody felt guilty all the time. Many people, in desperation, turned to disco.\r\n\r\nBut then along came the bold food pioneer who invented the Atkins Diet: Dr. Something Atkins. After decades of research on nutrition and weight gain -- including the now-famous Hostess Ding Dong Diet Experiment, which resulted in a laboratory rat the size of a Plymouth Voyager -- Dr. Atkins discovered an amazing thing: Calories don't matter! What matter are carbohydrates, which result when a carbo molecule and a hydrate molecule collide at high speeds and form tiny invisible doughnuts.\r\n\r\nDr. Atkins' discovery meant that -- incredible though it seemed -- as long as you avoided carbohydrates, you could, without guilt, eat high-fat, high-calorie foods such as cheese, bacon, lard, pork rinds and whale. You could eat an entire pig, as long as the pig had not recently been exposed to bread.\r\n\r\nAt first, like other groundbreaking pioneers such as Galileo and Eminem, Dr. Atkins met with skepticism, even hostility. The low-calorie foods industry went after him big time. The Celery Growers Association hired a detective to -- yes -- stalk him. His car tires were repeatedly slashed by what police determined to be shards of Melba toast.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Atkins persisted, because he had a dream -- a dream that, some day, he would help the human race by selling it 427 million diet books. And he did, achieving vindication for his diet before his tragic demise in an incident that the autopsy report listed as \"totally unrelated to the undigested 28-pound bacon cheeseburger found in his stomach\".\r\n\r\nBut the Atkins Diet lives on, helping millions of Americans to lose weight. The irony is, you can't tell this by looking at actual Americans, who have, as a group, become so heavy that North America will soon be underwater as far inland as Denver. Which can only mean one thing: You people are still sneaking Snickers. You should be ashamed of yourselves! Got any more?",

He then pointed in the window as I saw George Sr. walking with some really ugly woman. \r\nI then asked about his son, George Jr.  Peter said that he had missed it by an inch.  Sure enough, I looked in the window and saw our President walking with what I guess was a woman (it was hard to tell).  \r\nAs I was looking, I saw Bill Clinton walking with Britney Spears.

        "body": "Tigers really are as big and poofy and soft as they look, and they purr like a freight train going by. You find this out by taking one for a walk. To take a tiger for a walk, you first need a tiger. Tigers fresh from the bush are not recommended for the inexperienced. What you need is one who is used to the procedure. He or she is thus liable to be merely playful, rather than actively irritated. You also need a friend, whom you really, really trust. The friend carries an apple wood cane; apple, or some other wood which will bend under stress rather than shattering. This, friend, is your backup, and the cane is his or her only tool for everything, from knocking stuff out of the way that the tiger is liable to eat, to crowd control, to hooking on and madly hanging on if things go wrong.\r\n\r\nWhat YOU carry is a ten foot length of pass-link chain. This is your leash.\r\n\r\nPass-link chain is the stuff where the links will fit through each other. This is important. You need this so you can hook on a safety clip. The chain is looped about the tiger's neck and acts as a giant choke-chain, but the clip is there to keep a loop of some sort in case things go badly wrong. You carry the chain looped in one hand in a peculiar fashion which permits the whole length of chain to be dragged from your hand without taking your hand and/or arm with it. You practice this beforehand till you're sure you've got it right.\r\n\r\nThen you go into the cage with the tiger. Your friend does not. You gauge the tiger's mood and put the leash on the tiger. There isn't a whole lot more to say about this step except to say that that is why your friend is there, OUTside the cage. On your side is the fact that the tiger knows what the leash is for by this time and presumably is largely in favor of the idea.\r\n\r\nThis is where you find out that tigers are soft and poofy. They are also much, much larger than you had ever dreamed, when you're standing next to one.\r\n\r\nThen you take the tiger for a walk. Your friend walks in front with the cane to clear the way. You walk with the tiger at your side, keeping pretty good control and letting the tiger know that you are Paying Attention, because if the tiger thinks you are not Paying Attention, it will do what housecats do, let you know that you should be Paying Attention. Unlike housecats, the tiger is big enough not to have to do anything truly outrageous to rectify the situation. Reaching behind you with one forepaw and sweeping your legs out from under you is generally considered good enough by most tigers. They think this is hilarious. To this extent, tigers differ from housecats in that they seem to have a sense of humor.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the tiger will see something that it wants. In this case, the tiger will go where it wants to go, and your job is to stop it. This is generally done by wrapping the chain around something that you pass, as the tiger drags you away. This will slow it down enough for your friend to jump on top of you and grab the chain as you go bulleting across the countryside. The weight of two adult humans will generally slow a tiger down enough to make things manageable, whereas one will not.\r\n\r\nIt is not usual for the tiger to react to freedom by turning around and turning you into fajitas, though this would actually (at least in the short term) be an eminently practical thing for the tiger to do. They enjoy their fun but are generally not ill-tempered. If they are they don't get taken for walks.\r\n\r\nThey also purr like a freight train passing. Experts in the field claim that this is not purring, that it means something else, but you couldn't put it by me. Sure sounded like purring, at 16-2/3 RPM, but it sounded like purring.\r\n\r\nAll in all, an experience I highly recommend as a lifetime source of cocktail party conversation, but it sort of tends to leave you limp for the rest of the day.",

Lower productivity? No, it's something much more economically debilitating - and permanent.\r\n\r\nThree American lawyers have become the first foreign attorneys permitted to practice law in Japan. What's more, two of them are from New York!\r\n\r\nThe decline has begun.\r\n\r\nJapan has one attorney for every 10,000 residents, compared to the U.S. ratio of one attorney for every 390 residents. For every 100 attorneys trained in Japan, there are 1,000 engineers. In the United States, that ratio is reversed.\r\n\r\nBut a law that became effective on April 1 permits foreigners to practice in Japan for the first time since 1955. Already, an additional 20 American and six British lawyers have applied for permission to open practices in Japan.\r\n\r\nIf anything can slow the Japanese economy, it's the presence of American attorneys.

Today, this woman called in very upset because she caught her little daughter eating ants. I quickly reassured her that the ants are not harmful and there would be no need to bring her daughter into the hospital. She\r\ncalmed down, and at the end of the conversation happened to mention that she gave her daughter some ant poison to eat in order to kill the ants. I told her that she better bring her daughter into the Emergency room right away.\r\n\r\nHere's your sign lady. Wear it with pride.\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nIdiot # 2\r\nSeems that a year ago, some Boeing employees on the airfield decided to steal a life raft from one of the 747s. They were successful in getting it out of the plane and home. When they took it for a float on the river, a Coast Guard helicopter coming towards them surprised them. It turned out that the\r\nchopper was going in on the emergency locator beacon which activated when the raft was inflated.\r\n\r\nThey are no longer employed at Boeing.\r\n\r\nHere's your sign guys. Don't get it wet, the paint might run.\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nIdiot # 3\r\nA true story out of San Francisco: A man, wanting to rob a downtown Bank of America, walked into the branch and wrote \"this iz a stikkup. Put all your muny in this bag.\" While standing in line, waiting to give his note to the teller, he began to worry\r\nthat someone had seen him write the note and might call the police before he reached the teller window. So he left the Bank of America and crossed the street to Wells Fargo.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting a few minutes in line, he handed his note to the Wells Fargo teller. He read it and, surmising from his spelling errors that he wasn't the brightest light in the harbor, told him that she could not accept his stickup note because it was\r\nwritten on a Bank of America deposit slip and that he would either have to fill out a Wells Fargo deposit slip or go back to Bank of America. Looking somewhat defeated, the man said \"OK\"\r\nand left.\r\n\r\nHe was arrested a few minutes later, as he was waiting in line back at Bank of America.\r\n\r\nDon't bother with this guy's sign. He probably could read it anyway.\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nIdiot # 4\r\n\r\nA motorist was unknowingly caught in an automated speed trap that measured his speed using radar and photographed his car. He later received in the mail a ticket for $40 and a photo of his car. Instead of payment, he sent the police department a photograph of $40. Several days later, he received a letter from the police that contained another picture, this time of handcuffs. He immediately mailed in his $40.\r\n\r\nAnother sign (though this guy might be onto something worth thinking about)!\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nIdiot # 5\r\nA Guy walked into a little corner store with a shotgun and demanded all the cash from the cash drawer. After the cashier put the cash in a bag, the robber saw a bottle of scotch that he wanted behind the counter on the shelf. He told the cashier to put it in the bag as well, but he refused and said, \"Because I\r\ndon't believe you are over 21.\"\r\n\r\nThe robber said he was, but the clerk still refused to give it to him because he didn't believe him. At this point the robber took his driver's license out of his wallet and gave it to the clerk. The clerk looked it over, and agreed that the man was in fact over 21 and he put the scotch in the bag. The robber then\r\nran from the store with his loot. The cashier promptly called the police and gave the name and address of the robber that he got off the license.\r\n\r\nThey arrested the robber two hours later.\r\n\r\n(Remind me to have more signs printed up. Give this guy his!)\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nIdiot # 6\r\nA pair of Michigan robbers entered a record shop nervously waving revolvers. The first one shouted, \"Nobody move!\"\r\n\r\nWhen his partner moved, the startled first bandit shot him.\r\n\r\n(This guy doesn't need a sign, he probably figured it out himself.)\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nIdiot # 7\r\nArkansas: Seems this guy wanted some beer pretty badly. He decided that he'd just throw a cinder block through a liquor store window, grab some booze, and run. So he lifted the cinder block and heaved it over his head at the window.\r\n\r\nThe cinder block bounced back and hit the would-be thief on the head, knocking him unconscious. Seems the liquor store window was made of Plexi-Glass. The whole event was caught on videotape.\r\n\r\n(Oh, that smarts. Give him his sign!)\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nIdiot # 8\r\nAnn Arbor: The Ann Arbor News crime column reported that a man walked into a Burger King in Ypsilanti, Michigan at 12:50 am flashed a gun and demanded cash.\r\n\r\nThe clerk turned him down because he said the couldn't open the cash register without a food order. When the man ordered onion rings, the clerk said they weren't available for breakfast. The man, frustrated, walked away",

He sought the counsel of the two wise men in town, Hing, who was scientist, and Ming, who was a sorcerer.\r\n\r\nHing, who has had many advanced course hours in poultry science, consults the classic text in poultry disease, \"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Diseases of Chickens, But Were Afraid to Ask.\" In the book, Hing finds a reference to the report of a study showing that feeding the chickens with an infusion of gum tree leaves is often a remedy for chickens losing their feathers. Meanwhile Ming reads obscure writings of ancient wise men, he meditates, and he reads tarot cards and examines the entrails of a pig. Getting no inspiration he uses his old standby, reading tea leaves. In a spark of discovery, it comes to him that an infusion of gum tree leaves is the cure.\r\n\r\nSo the two wise men report back to the influential Chinese farmer. Ming says, \"As gum sticks to tables and chairs, so shall an infusion of gum tree leaves make feathers stick to chickens.\" Hing agrees, saying \"Studies show that infusions of gum tree leaves alleviate feather loss in chickens.\" The influential Chinese farmer is ecstatic, for the two wisest men in town are of a single mind. He decides to follow their recommendation, but it does not work.\r\n\r\nMoral of the Story: \"All of Hing's courses and all of Ming's ken couldn't get gum tea to feather a hen.\"",

And now, the assignment as submitted by\r\n\r\nRebecca & Gary:\r\n\r\nAt first, Laurie couldn't decide which kind of tea she wanted.\r\nThe chamomile, which used to be her favorite for lazy evenings\r\nat home, now reminded her too much of Carl, who once said in\r\nhappier times, that he liked chamomile. But she felt she must\r\nnow, at all costs, keep her mind off Carl. His possessiveness\r\nwas suffocating, and if she thought about him too much her\r\nasthma started acting up again. So chamomile was out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Advance Sergeant Carl Harris, leader of the attack\r\nsquadron now in orbit over Skylon 4, had more important things\r\nto think about than the neuroses of an air-headed asthmatic\r\nbimbo named Laurie with whom he had spent one sweaty night over\r\na year ago. \"A.S. Harris to Geostation 17,\" he said into his\r\ntransgalactic communicator. \"Polar orbit established. No sign of\r\nresistance so far...\". But before he could sign off a bluish\r\nparticle beam flashed out of nowhere and blasted a hole through\r\nhis ship's cargo bay. The jolt from the direct hit sent him\r\nflying out of his seat and across the cockpit.\r\n\r\nHe bumped his head and died almost immediately, but not before\r\nhe felt one last pang of regret for physically brutalizing the\r\none woman who had ever had feelings for him. Soon afterwards,\r\nEarth stopped its pointless hostilities towards the peaceful\r\nfarmers of Skylon 4. \"Congress Passes Law Permanently Abolishing\r\nWar and Space Travel\", Laurie read in her newspaper one morning.\r\nThe news simultaneously excited her and bored her. She stared\r\nout the window, dreaming of her youth when the days had passed\r\nunhurriedly and carefree, with no newspapers to read, no\r\ntelevision to distract her from her sense of innocent wonder at\r\nall the beautiful things around her. \"Why must one lose one's\r\ninnocence to become a woman?\", she pondered wistfully.\r\n\r\nLittle did she know, but she has less than 10 seconds to live.\r\nThousands of miles above the city, the Anu-udrian mothership\r\nlaunched the first of its lithium fusion missiles. The\r\ndim-witted wimpy peaceniks who pushed the Unilateral Aerospace\r\nDisarmament Treaty through Congress had left Earth a defenseless\r\ntarget for the hostile alien empires who were determined to\r\ndestroy the human race. Within two hours after the passage of\r\nthe treaty the Anu-udrian ships were on course for Earth,\r\ncarrying enough firepower to pulverize the entire planet. With\r\nno one to stop them, they swiftly initiated their diabolical\r\nplan. The lithium fusion missile entered the atmosphere\r\nunimpeded. The President, in his top-secret mobile submarine\r\nheadquarters on the ocean floor off the coast of Guam, felt the\r\ninconceivably massive explosion which vaporized Laurie and 85\r\nmillion other Americans. The President slammed his fist on the\r\nconference table. \"We can't allow this! I'm going to veto that\r\ntreaty! Let's blow 'em out of the sky!\"\r\n\r\nThis is absurd. I refuse to continue this mockery of literature.\r\nMy writing partner is a violent, chauvinistic, semi-literate\r\nadolescent.\r\n\r\nYeah? Well, you're a self-centered tedious neurotic whose\r\nattempts at writing are the literary equivalent of Valium.\r\n\r\nAsshole.\r\n\r\nBitch.",

        "body": "THESE ARE REAL NOTES FROM A REAL CHILLI COOK OFF\r\n\r\nNotes from an inexperienced chili taster named Frank, who was visiting Texas from the east coast:\r\n\r\n\"Recently, I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The original person called in sick at the last moment, and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking directions to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two judges (native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting. So I accepted. Here are the scorecards from the event:\r\n\r\n\r\nChilli # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili\r\n\r\nJUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.\r\nJUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.\r\nFRANK: Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy.\r\n\r\n\r\nChilli # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili\r\n\r\nJUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.\r\nJUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.\r\nFRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.\r\n\r\n\r\nChilli # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili\r\n\r\nJUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.\r\nJUDGE TWO: A bean less chili, a bit salty, good use of red peppers.\r\nFRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now, get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all the beer.\r\n\r\n\r\nChilli # 4: Bubba's Black Magic\r\n\r\nJUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.\r\nJUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.\r\nFRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it, is it possible to burn-out taste buds? Sally, the bar maid, was standing behind me with fresh refills, that 300 lb. bitch is starting to look HOT, just like this nuclear-waste I'm eating. Is chilli an aphrodisiac?\r\n\r\n\r\nChilli # 5: Linda's Legal Lip Remover\r\n\r\nJUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.\r\nJUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.\r\nFRANK: My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off? It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those rednecks!\r\n\r\n\r\nChilli # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety\r\n\r\nJUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice and peppers.\r\nJUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb.\r\nFRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I shit myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally, she must be kinkier than I thought. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone!\r\n\r\n\r\nChilli # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili\r\n\r\nJUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.\r\nJUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chilli peppers at the last moment. I should note that I am worried about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.\r\nFRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit to match my damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. Screw it, I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4 inch hole in my stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\nChilli # 8: Mount Saint Helen's Chili\r\n\r\nJUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all, not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.\r\nJUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili, neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge Number 3 passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Yank, wonder how he would have reacted to a really hot chili?\r\nFRANK: -------------- (editor's note: Judge #3 was unable to report)",

As I turn on the hose in the driveway, I look over at my car and decide my car needs washing.\r\n\r\nAs I start toward the garage, I notice that there is mail on the porch table that I brought up from the mail box earlier.\r\n\r\nI decide to go through the mail before I wash the car.\r\n\r\nI lay my car keys down on the table, put the junk mail in the garbage can under the table, and notice that the can is full, so I decide to put the bills back on the table and take out the garbage first.\r\n\r\nBut then I think, since I'm going to be near the mailbox when I take out the garbage anyway, I may as well pay the bills first.\r\n\r\nI take my check book off the table, and see that there is only 1 check left.\r\n\r\nMy extra checks are in my desk in the study, so I go inside the house to my desk where I find the can of Coke that I had been drinking.\r\n\r\nI'm going to look for my checks, but first I need to push the Coke aside so that I don't accidentally knock it over. I see that the Coke is getting warm, and I decide I should put it in the refrigerator to keep it cold.\r\n\r\nAs I head toward the kitchen with the Coke, a vase of flowers on the counter catches my eye -- they need to be watered.\r\n\r\nI set the Coke down on the counter, and I discover my reading glasses that I've been searching for all morning.\r\n\r\nI decide I better put them back on my desk, but first I'm going to water the flowers.\r\n\r\nI set the glasses back down on the counter, fill a container with water and suddenly I spot the TV remote. Someone left it on the kitchen table.\r\n\r\nI realize that tonight when I go to watch TV, I will be looking for the remote, but I won't remember that it's on the kitchen table, so I decide to put it back in the den where it belongs, but first I'll water the flowers.\r\n\r\nI pour some water in the flowers, but quite a bit of it spills on the floor, so I set the remote back down on the table, get some towels and wipe up the spill.\r\n\r\nThen I head down the hall trying to remember what I was planning to do.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day:\r\n\r\nThe car isn't washed, the bills aren't paid, there is a warm can of Coke sitting on the counter and the flowers don't have enough water, there is still only 1 check in my check book, I can't find the remote, I can't find my glasses, and I don't remember what I did with the car keys.\r\n\r\nThen, when I try to figure out why nothing got done today, I'm really baffled because I know I was busy all day long, and I'm really tired.\r\n\r\nI realize this is a serious problem, and I'll try to get some help for it, but first I'll check my e-mail.\r\n\r\nDon't laugh -- if this isn't you yet, your day is coming!!\r\n\r\nGROWING OLDER IS MANDATORY.

The cardinal and Quasimodo are down on the steps talking, \"Quasi,\" said the cardinal, \"I'm sorry to say this but I can't let you go retire. We don't have anyone to ring the bells if you go. We'll keep the job offer open to anyone, but no one seems to want to do it.\" As he was speaking, an armless man runs up, and out of breath says, \"I'm --- here about --- the bell -- ringing job. Is it still --- available?\" The cardinal looks to Quasimodo and says, \"Hey, it's your choice to try him out.\" Quasimodo nods his shoulders and leads the man up to the bell tower.\r\n\tAs they arrive on the platform, Quasimodo explains to the man how the job works. \"Well, you take this large rope here and pull on it really hard, which moves the bell, causing the clapper inside the bell to hit the sides and make it ring. As you can well guess, we pull the rope once for each hour. It's almost three 'o' clock now, so I'll ring the bell the first time, and you have to ring it the second time.\" He looks out the window, watches the sun for a moment, then goes over and pulls the bell rope. *CLANG* the bell rings. \"Ok, you're turn.\"\r\n\tThe armless man goes over to the rope and tries to get a good pull on it by grabbing it with his shoulder and head, pulling it with his teeth, stepping on the rope all to no avail. \"Come on man, it was only 1 'o' clock two hours ago, we gotta get this bell rung.\" The man, obviously flustered, looks around. He then takes about ten steps away from the bell and leans forward. Then, as fast as his legs can carry him, he charges at the bell. *CLANG* the bell rings from the man's head hitting the bell. Quasimodo cringes as the man stumbles around for a moment. \"Sorry to have to say this, but you have to ring that bell one more time,\" says Quasimodo. The man stumbles around for another moment and then steps back, and runs at the bell again. *CLANG* the bell goes off again. Right as Quasimodo is about to tell the guy \"Good Job\", the man, still dazed, stumbles around and falls out the window, all the way to the steps of the cathedral below, dying instantly.\r\n\tThe cardinal runs out to the man's body, turns around and looks at the window the man fell from, and Quasimodo is now leaning out of. \"Quasimodo, get your ass down here NOW!\" he yells. Quasimodo runs down to the front of the cathedral, and in front of the enraged cardinal. \"Quasi, I thought we fixed the problem we had before and you promised you weren't going to throw people from the bell tower. What the hell happened?!?\" Quasimodo explains the story to him. The cardinal then says, \"Well, we should let his family know about this. Did he tell you his name, where he lived, anything?\" \r\n\tQuasimodo answers him, \"No, we never even mentioned his name or where he was from.

(with the gameboy, X box, T.V. and PS2.)  \r\n\r\n15) In football, when the quarterback says HIKE, that doesn't mean that he got kicked in the ass.  \r\n\r\n16) When Spongebob rips his pants, that's normal. \r\n\r\n17)  When you are in Religion and you are daydreaming and the teacher says, \"And so the answer is what, ( your name )?\"  Just say \"GOD\" it's the answer to pretty much anything. Right? \r\n\r\n18) Always order pizza saying \"Why\" after every question the waiter says. \r\n\r\n19) When people on the street are selling those suckers and they take your money to foundations,  as sweet as it may be, never take the sucker, you never know where it has been. \r\n\r\n20) When you lose the romote, look under you. \r\n\r\n Well I hope you like these interesting things and take note to them.",

They follow the sensor until they come up on a large stone sentinel (guard) crouched down with its arms around its legs. They can detect life signs from it, but it doesn't move, doesn't appear to breathe. \r\nThey call back to their commanders on Earth and report this abnormal situation. Because of this, many great scientific minds, military generals, politicians, and technical wizards are sent to try to interact with this leviathan. After many months, every walk of life has come to try to communicate with the sentinel, but nothing happens. It just sits there with its arms around its legs.\r\nFinally, one of the teamsters who sets up the stage occasionally when some big-shot dignitary comes thinking he can do better than the smartest people in the galaxy. He turns to the sentinel and in frustration yells, \"Will this thing EVER communicate with us?!?!?!\"\r\nSuddenly the sound of stone grinding against stone starts, and the great stone sentinel stands up. It scratches its chin pensively, then blurts out, \"No.\" It then crouches down again and assumes the same position it was in before.\r\n\r\nAnother teamster who saw this turns to the man who yelled at the sentinel originally and says, \"Well, it only stands to reason.\"",

They both graduate #1 and #2 in their class, with Anthony being #1 and Matthew being #2. They then both go to their new parishes, which instantly become hugely popular. For years the two of them rise through the ranks of the Catholic Church, becoming bishops, arch-bishops, and cardinals around the same time. Always though, Anthony is considered the slightly better of the two. \r\nEventually, the reigning Pope passes away, and the College of Cardinals is convened to choose the next Pope. They debate for days until the list is down to just two names, Anthony and Matthew. After another day or two of deliberation, the white smoke is seen, and they make the announcement, Matthew Anderson will be the next Pope. \r\nAnthony, happy for his friend, is perturbed because he knows in his heart that he is better and would make a better Pope. He pleads for time in front of the College of Cardinals, and is granted an audience. He asks them why they decided on Matthew and not him. For a few quiet, still minutes, not a single person talks. Then an old cardinal in the back speaks up. \"Anthony, we know you are the better of the two, but we ultimately had to come to a decision. That decision is that we just could not live with ourselves if we named the next Pope, Pope Sicola.\"\r\n\r\nHint:\r\nRead \"Pope Sicola\" quickly if you don't get the punch line.",

Guess we'd be better off leaving the car in the garage.\" \r\n\r\n(7) \"Kids today are impossible. Those ducktail hair cuts make it impossible to stay groomed. Next thing you know, boys will be wearing their hair as long as the girls'.\" \r\n\r\n(8) \"I'm afraid to send my kids to the movies any more.

        "body": "The Fart Dictionary\r\n\r\n \r\nThe Alarm Fart - This is a good fart for the beginner. It is easy to identify. It starts with a loud unnaturally high note, wavers like a siren, and ends with a quick downward note that stops before you expect it to. It sounds like something is wrong. If it happens to you, you will know right off why it is called the Alarm Fart. You will be alarmed. The alarm fart however is rare.\r\n\r\nThe Amplified Fart - This is any fart that gets its power more from being amplified than from the fart itself. A metal porch swing will amplify a fart every time. So will a plywood table,and empty fifty gallon drum, a tin roof, or some empty cardboard boxes if they are strong through being amplified in this way can be called an Amplified Fart. These are common farts under the right conditions \r\n\r\nThe Anticipated Fart - This one warns that it is back there waiting for some time before it arrives. A person who is uneasy for a time in a crowd and who later farts at a time when they think no one will notice has farted an Anticipated Fart. \r\n\r\nThe Back Seat Fart - This is a fart that occurs only in automobiles. It is identified chiefly by odor. The Back Seat Fart can usually be concealed by traffic noise as it is an eased-out fart and not very loud. But its foul odor will give it away, due to the way air moves around in a car. It is often followed by someone saying, \"Who farted in the back seat?\" \r\n\r\nThe Barn Owl Fart - A familiarity with owl calls is helpful in identifying this fart. Almost any morning if you get up just before daybreak you can hear one of these birds talking to himself. It's a sort of a crazy laugh, particularly the way it ends. If you hear a fart that has about eight notes in it, ending on a couple of down notes, and it sounds maniacal, you have heard the rare Barn Owl Fart. \r\n\r\nThe Bathtub Fart - People who would never in their life know one fart from another, who would like to act like fart don't exist, will have to admit that a Bathtub Fart is something special. It is the only fart you can see! What you see is the bubbles. The Bathtub Fart can be either single or multiple noted and fair or foul as to odor. It makes no difference. The farter's location is what does it. Maybe there is a kind of muffled pong and one big bubble. Or there may be a ping ping ping and a bunch of bubbles. The sound I should point out depends somewhat on the depth of the water, and even more on the tub. If it is one of those big old heavy tubs with the funny legs you can get terrific sound effects. While one of the new thin ones half buried in the floor can be disappointing.\r\n\r\nThe Biggest Fart in the World Fart - Like the great bald eagle, this fart is pretty well described just by its name. This can either be a group one or a group two fart and can occur just about anywhere. I heard it one time, a group two identification, in a crowded high school auditorium one night, right in that silence that happens when a room full of people has stopped singing the Star Spangled Banner and sat down. It came from the back. There was not a soul in that room that missed it. A fart like that can be impressive. The most diagnostic characteristic of the Biggest Fart In The World is it size.Fart freaks who go around showing off, farting like popcorn machines, and making faces before they fart or asking you to pull their finger and then they fart, never have what it takes for this one, which is rare even among your most serious farter's.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bullet Fart - Its single and most pronounced diagnostic characteristic is its sound. It sounds like a rifle shot. The farter can be said to have snapped it off. It can startle spectators and farter alike. Fairly common following the eating of the more common fart foods, such as beans. \r\n\r\nThe Burning Brakes Fart - A silent fart identified by odor alone. Usually and adult fart, occurring while the adult is driving a car or has a front seat passenger who farts. The Burning Brakes Fart actually does smell a little like burning brakes, and seems to hang around longer than most farts Which gives whoever farted a chance to make a big show of checking to see if the emergency brake has been left on. When he finds it hasn't you know who farted. A common automobile fart.\r\n\r\nThe Car Door Fart - Either a group one or a group two fart. Very tricky. It is meant to be a concealed fart. A matter of close timing is involved, the farter trying to fart at the exact moment he slams the car door shut. It is usually a good loud fart. It is one of the funnier farts when it doesn't work, which is almost every time. It is a desperation fart and not too common.\r\n\r\nThe Celestial Fart - Not to be confused with the Did An Angel Speak Fart, which is simply any loud fart in church. The Celestial Fart is soft and delicate, surprising in a boy or an adult. It is probably the most shy of all farts and might be compared with the wood thrush, a very shy bird. It does not have the sly or cunning sound of the Whisper Fart. It is just a very small clear fart with no odor at all. Very rare.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Firecracker Fart - This is an exceptional multiple noted fart identified by the number, and variety of its noises, mostly pops and bangs. Often when you think it is all over, it still has a few pops and bangs to go. In friendly company this one can get applause. Uncommon. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Command Fart - This fart differs from the Anticipated Fart in that it can be held for long periods of time waiting for the right moment. Unlike the Anticipated Fart, it is intended to be noticed. Harold Tabor recently held a Command Fart for the whole period in history class and let it go right at the end when the teacher asked if there were any questions. \r\n\r\nThe Common Fart - This fart needs little description. It is to the world of farts what the house sparrow is to the world of birds. I can see no point in describing this far any further. \r\n\r\nThe Crowd Fart - The Crowd Fart is distinguished by its very potent odor, strong enough to make quite a few people look around. The trick here is not to identify the fart but the farter. This is almost impossible unless the farter panics, and starts a fit of coughing or starts staring at the ceiling or the sky as though something up there fascinates him. In which case he is the one. Very common. \r\n\r\nThe Cushioned Fart - A concealed fart, sometimes successful. The farter is usually on the fat side, sometimes a girl. They will squirm and push their butt way down into the cushions of a sofa or over-stuffed chair and ease-out a fart very carefully without moving then or for some time after. Some odor may escape, but usually not much. Common with some people. \r\n\r\nThe Did An Angel Speak Fart - This is any loud fart in church. This fart was first called to my attention by my father. He probably read about it somewhere. For fart watchers who go to church, this is a good one to watch for as this is the only place it can be found.\r\n\r\nThe Dud Fart - The Dud Fart is not really a fart at all. It's a fart that fails. For this reason it is strictly a group one identification fart, because there is no real way you can identify a fart that somebody else expected to fart but didn't. It is the most private of all farts. In most cases the farter usually feels a little disappointed. \r\n\r\nThe Echo Fart - This is a fart that can be wrongly identified. It is not some great loud fart in an empty gym or on the rim of the Grand Canyon. The true Echo Fart is a fart that makes its own echo. It is a two-toned fart, the first tone loud, then a pause, and then the second tone. Like an echo. \r\n\r\nThe G and L Fart - This is one of the most ordinary and pedestrian of farts, known to everyone. Certainly it is the least gross. If you have not already guessed, G and L stands for Gambled and Lost. One of the most embarrassing of all farts, even when you are alone. \r\n\r\nThe Ghost Fart - A doubtful fart in most cases, as it is supposed to be identified by odor alone and to occur, for instance, in an empty house. You enter and smell a fart, yet no one is there. People will insist that only a fart could have that odor, but some believe it is just something that happens to smell like a fart. \r\n\r\nThe Hic-Hachoo-Fart Fart - This is strictly an old lady's fart. What happens is that the person manages to hiccough, sneeze, and fart all at the same time. After an old lady farts a Hic-Hachoo-Fart Fart she will usually pat her chest and say, \"My, oh my,\" or \"Well, well.\" There is no reason she should not be proud, as this is probably as neat an old person's fart as there is. \r\n\r\nThe Jerk Fart - The Jerk Fart is a fart by a jerk who smirks, smiles, grins, and points to himself in case you missed it. It is usually a single-noted, off-key, fading away, sort of whistle fart, altogether pitiful, but the jerk will act as if he has just farted the Biggest Fart in the World Fart. \r\n\r\nThe John Fart - The John Fart is simply any ordinary fart farted on the john. It is naturally a group one identification, with the sound, whatever it was, somewhat muffled. If it is all the person's trip to the john amounted to he will be disappointed for sure. Common as pigeons. \r\n\r\nThe Lead Fart - The heaviest of all farts. It sounds like a dropped ripe watermelon. Or a falling body in some cases. It is the only fart that goes thud. Except for the odor, which is also very heavy, it could be missed altogether as a fart. What was that, you might think? And never guess. \r\n\r\nThe Malted Milk Ball Fart - Odor alone is diagnostic and positively identifies this fart. It smells exactly like malted milk balls. No other food works this way. It is rare. \r\n\r\nThe Oh My God Fart - This is the most awful and dreadful stinking of all farts - a fart that smells like a month-old rotten egg - as the Oh My God Fart. If you should ever encounter it, however, you may first want to say, oh sh*t, which would be understandable. \r\n\r\nThe Omen Fart - This is the adult version of the Poo-Poo Fart. About the only difference is that the farter will not say anything. He will just look kind of funny and head for the john. This one is easy to spot if you pay attention. \r\n\r\nThe Organic Fart - Sometimes called the Health Food Nut Fart. The person who farts an Organic Fart may be talking about the healthy food he eats even when he farts. If he is heavily into health foods he may even ask if you noticed how good and pure and healthy his fart smells. It may smell to you like any other fart, but there is no harm in agreeing with him. He is doing what he thinks is best. \r\n\r\nThe Quiver Fart - A group one identification fart only. When you fart, it quivers. If it tickles, then it is the Tickle Fart. If you have to scratch it, then it is the Scratchass Fart. \r\n\r\nThe Rambling Phaduka Fart - You must not be fooled by its pretty-sounding name, as this is one of the most frightening of all farts. It is frightening to farter and spectator alike. It has a sound of pain to it. What is most diagnostic about it, however, is its length. It is the longest-lasting fart there is. It will sometimes leave the farter unable to speak. As though he has had the wind knocked out of him. A strong, loud, wavering fart, it goes on for at least fifteen seconds. \r\n\r\nThe Relief Fart - Sound or odor don't matter on this one. What matters is the tremendous sense of relief that you have finally farted. Some people will even say, \"Wow, what a relief.\" Very common. \r\n\r\nThe Reluctant Fart - This is probably one of the oldest farts known to man. The Reluctant Fart is a fart that seems to have a mind of its own. It gives the impression that it likes staying where it is. It will come when it is ready, not before. This can take half-a-day in some instances. \r\n\r\nThe Rusty Gate Fart - The sound of this fart seems almost impossible for a fart. Is is the most dry and squeaky sound a fart can make. The Rusty Gate Fart sounds as if it would have worked a lot easier if it had been oiled. It sounds like a fart that hurts. \r\n\r\nThe S.B.D. Fart - S.B.D. stands for Silent But Deadly. This is no doubt one of the most common farts that exists. No problem of identification with this one. \r\n\r\nThe Sandpaper Fart - This one scratches. Otherwise it may not amount to much. You should remember that if you reach back and scratch, it automatically becomes a Scratchass Fart. Common. \r\n\r\nThe Skillsaw Fart - A truly awesome fart. It vibrates the farter. Really shakes him up. People back away. It sounds like an electric skillsaw ripping through a piece of half-inch plywood. Very impressive. Not too common. \r\n\r\nThe Sonic Boom Fart - The people who believe in this fart claim it is even bigger than the Biggest Fart In The World Fart. The Sonic Boom Fart is supposed to shake the house and rattle the windows. This is ridiculous. No fart in the world shakes houses and rattles windows. A fart that could do that would put the farter into orbit or blow his crazy head off. \r\n\r\nThe Splatter Fart - Unfortunately the Splatter Fart exists. It is the wettest of all farts. It probably should not be called a fart at all. \r\n\r\nThe Stutter Fart - If you think stuttering is funny, this is a very funny fart. It is a fart that can't seem to get going. The sound is best described as pt,pt,pt-pt,pt-pt-pt,pop,pop-pop-pop-POW! It is usually a forced-out fart that gets caught crossways, as they say, and only gets farted after considerable effort. \r\n\r\nThe Taco Bell Fart - The Taco Bell Fart is far richer and full-bodied than your ordinary Junk Fart and takes longer to build up. Sometimes hours or even a day. But it will get there. And it will hang around after, too. Even on a windy day. \r\n\r\nThe Teflon Fart - Slips out without a sound and no strain at all. A very good fart in situations where you would rather not fart at all. You can be talking to someone and not miss saying a word. If the wind is right he will never know. \r\n\r\nThe Thank God I'm Alone Fart - Everyone knows this rotten fart. You look around after you have farted and say, \"Thank God I'm alone.\" Then you get out of there fast! \r\n\r\nThe Tickle Fart - A group one only and one of the easiest to identify. Usually a slow soft sort of fart. If you like being tickled this is the fart for you!",

Then they push again, jump on again, and so on...\r\nMac Airlines\r\nAll the stewards, captains, baggage handlers, and ticket agents look and act exactly the same. Every time you ask questions about details, you are gently but firmly told that you don't need to know, don't want to know, and everything will be done for you without your ever having to know, so just shut up.\r\nWindows Air\r\nThe terminal is pretty and colourful, with friendly stewards, easy baggage check and boarding, and a smooth take-off. After about 10 minutes in the air, the plane explodes with no warning whatsoever.\r\nWindows NT Air\r\nJust like Windows Air, but costs more, uses much bigger planes, and takes out all the other aircraft within a 40-mile radius when it explodes.\r\nWindows XP Air\r\nYou turn up at the airport,which is under contract to only allow XP Air planes. All the aircraft are identical, brightly coloured and three times as big as they need to be. The signs are huge and all point the same way. Whichever way you go, someone pops up dressed in a cloak and pointed hat insisting you follow him. Your luggage and clothes are taken off you and replaced with an XP Air suit and suitcase identical to everyone around you as this is included in the exorbitant ticket cost. The aircraft will not take off until you have signed a contract. The inflight entertainment promised turns out to be the same Mickey Mouse cartoon repeated over and over again. You have to phone your travel agent before you can have a meal or drink. You are searched regularly throughout the flight. If you go to the toilet twice or more you get charged for a new ticket. No matter what destination you booked you will always end up crash landing at Whistler in Canada.\r\nLinux Air\r\nDisgruntled employees of all the other OS airlines decide to start their own airline. They build the planes, ticket counters, and pave the runways themselves. They charge a small fee to cover the cost of printing the ticket, but you can also download and print the ticket yourself.\r\nWhen you board the plane, you are given a seat, four bolts, a wrench and a copy of the seat-HOWTO.html. Once settled, the fully adjustable seat is very comfortable, the plane leaves and arrives on time without a single problem, the in-flight meal is wonderful. You try to tell customers of the other airlines about the great trip, but all they can say is, \"You had to do what with the seat?\"",

No hogs to slop, feed to pitch, mash to mix, wood to split, fire to lay. Men got to shave but it is not so bad, there's warm water.\r\n\r\nBreakfast is strong on trimmings like fruit juice, cereal, eggs, bacon, etc, but kind of weak on chops, potatoes, ham, steak, fried eggplant, pie and other regular food, but tell Walt and Elmer you can always sit by the two city boys that live on coffee. Their food plus yours holds you till noon when you get fed again.\r\n\r\nIt's no wonder these city boys can't walk much. We go on \"route marches\", which the platoon sergeant says are long walks to harden us. If he thinks so, it's not my place to tell him different. A \"route march\" is about as far as to our mailbox at home.\r\nThen the city guys get sore feet and we all ride back in trucks. The country is nice but awful flat.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant is like a school teacher. He nags a lot.\r\nThe Capt. is like the school board. Majors and colonels just ride around and frown. They don't bother you none.\r\n\r\nThis next will kill Walt and Elmer with laughing. I keep getting medals for shooting. I don't know why. The bulls-eye is near as big as a chipmunk head and don't move, and it ain't shooting at you like the Higgett boys at home. All you got to do is lie there all comfortable and hit it You don't even load your own cartridges. They come in boxes.\r\n\r\nThen we have what they call hand-to hand combat training.\r\nYou get to wrestle with them city boys. I have to be real careful though, they break real easy. It ain't like fighting with that ole bull at home. I'm about the best they got in this except for that Tug Jordan from over in Silver Lake. I only beat him once. He joined up the same time as me, but I'm only 5'6\" and 130 pounds, and he's 6'8\" and weighs near 300 pounds dry.\r\n\r\nBe sure to tell Walt and Elmer to hurry and join before other fellers get onto this setup and come stampeding in.\r\n\r\nYour loving daughter,\r\nGail.",

The only thing that will make the dolphins behave is baby seagull meat.  I want you to take this bag and go down to the beach and get some baby seagulls, but be careful because a lion has escaped from the zoo.  They say it's been shot with a tranq gun so it shouldn't be a problem.\"\r\n\r\nSo, the young man took the bag, made his way down to the beach and got the seagulls with no problem.  He decided to take the short cut through the woods on his way back.  Suddenly, as he rounded a bend in the path, he saw the escaped lion laying across the path ahead of him, apparently sleeping.  \r\n\r\nThe bushes were rather thick at this point, so he had only two choices: go past the lion or back the way he came.  He decided he didn't have enough time to go back.  He got up his nerve and very,very carefully stepped over the lion.  He did so without waking it and was breathing a sigh of relief when a police officer stepped out of the woods and told him he was under arrest.\r\n\r\n\"But, Officer, what's the charge?\" he queried.\r\n\r\n\"Transporting young gulls across a sedate lion.\" (Transporting youing girls across state lines)",

After spending a few weeks at home alone he decided that he needed some companionship and headed for the pet store. After looking around the store he thought that he would like to purchase a bird. He began looking at the selection available and noticed that one bird sold for $100 and the bird in the next cage was priced at $10,000. He looked and looked and studied the two birds, but he could not tell the difference, so he called over the store owner and asked him to explain. \r\n\r\nThe owner said, \"The $10,000 bird is a perfect bird and the $100 bird is just the average everyday bird.\".\r\n\r\n\"But I still don't see the difference,\" said the old man. \r\n\r\nThe owner explained, \"The $100 bird has a small hump on his beak and that made him just average.\" \r\n\r\n\"You're telling me that if that $100 dollar bird didn't have that tiny little hump in his beak he would be worth $10,000?!?!?\" exclaimed Dave. \r\n\r\n\"Well,\" says the owner, \"he might not be worth $10,000 but he would be worth quite a bit more.\" \r\n\r\nWith much delight Dave says \"I'll take him! You see, I have been a master machinist my whole life and have worked with tools and my hands since I was a young boy. I think that I can file that hump off the bird's beak and make some extra money.\" \r\n\r\n\"You might be able to do that,\" says the owner, \"but I must warn you that there is a membrane in the bird's beak and if you file too deeply you will kill the bird.\" \r\n\r\n\"No problem,\" says Dave with great confidence, and leaves the store. \r\n\r\nAbout a week later Dave was back in the pet store and the owner asks how things went with the bird. \"He died,\" Dave said dejectedly. \r\n\r\nThe owner says, \"I warned you that you could file to deeply and that would kill the bird.\" \r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's not what happened,\" replied Dave. \r\n\r\n\"Well what happened then?\" \r\n\r\n\"I accidentally crushed his head in the vice.\"",

He was everything their client wanted and had never even seen a woman.\r\n\r\nAfter much convincing, the groom was put on a jet to meet the bride. It was love at first sight for the woman & the nuptials took place almost immediately.\r\n\r\nThe bride shyly removed to the bathroom after excusing herself to her new husband. When she returned to the bedroom a few minutes later, she found him naked in the center of the room with all the furniture pushed back against the walls.\r\n\r\nWhen she inquired the groom stated: \" I don't know squat about women, but if they're anything like kangaroos.....we're going to need all the room we can get.\"",

        "body": "* This is a good reminder, for all of us. You can never read this \r\ntoo many times!! \r\n \r\n1. Tip from police: The elbow is the strongest point on your body. If you are close enough, USE IT! \r\n \r\n2. If a robber asks for your wallet and/or purse, DO NOT HAND IT  TO HIM. Toss it away from you....chances are that he is more \r\ninterested in your wallet and/or purse than you and he will go for the wallet/purse. RUN LIKE MAD IN THE OTHER DIRECTION! \r\n\r\n3. If you are ever thrown into the trunk of a car: Kick out the back tail lights and stick your arm out the hole and start waving like crazy. The driver won't see you but everybody else will. This has\r\nsaved lives. \r\n\r\n 4. Women have a tendency to get into their car after shopping, eating, working, etc., and just sit (doing their checkbook, or making a list, etc.) DON'T DO THIS! The predator will be watching you and this is the perfect opportunity for him to get in on the passenger side, put a gun to your head, and tell you where to go. AS SOON AS YOU GET INTO YOUR CAR, LOCK THE DOORS & LEAVE. \r\n\r\n5. A few notes about getting into your car in a parking lot, or parking garage: \r\nA.) Be AWARE: look around you, look into your car, at the passenger side floor, and in the back seat. (and check out under the car as you approach) \r\n B.) If you are parked next to a big van, enter your car from the passenger door. Most serial killers attack their victims by  pulling them into their vans while the women are attempting to get\r\ninto their cars. \r\n C.) Look at the car parked on the driver's side of your  vehicle and the passenger side. If a male is sitting alone in the seat  nearest your car, you may want to walk back into the mall, or work \r\nand get a guard/policeman to walk you back out. IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY. (And better paranoid than dead.)\r\n \r\n6. ALWAYS take the elevator instead of the stairs. (Stairwells are horrible places to be alone and a perfect crime spot).\r\n\r\n 7. If the predator has a gun and you are not under his control, ALWAYS RUN! The predator will only hit you (a running target) 4 in 100 times; And even then, it most likely WILL NOT be a vital organ. RUN!\r\n\r\n 8. As women, we are always trying to be sympathetic: STOP IT! It may get you raped, or killed. Ted Bundy, the serial killer, was a  good-looking, well educated man, who ALWAYS played on the sympathies of unsuspecting women. He walked with a cane, or a limp and often asked \"for help\" into his vehicle or with his vehicle, which is when\r\nhe abducted his next victim.\r\n\r\n* Someone just told me that her friend heard a crying baby on her  porch the night before last, and she called the police because it was late and she thought it was weird.The police told her \"Whatever you do, DO NOT open the door.\" The lady then said that it sounded like the baby had crawled near a window, and she was worried that it would crawl to the street and get run over. The policeman said, \"We already have a unit on the way, whatever you do, DO NOT open the door.\" He told her that they think a serial killer has a baby's cry recorded and uses it to coax women out of their homes thinking that someone dropped off a baby. He said they have not verified it, but have had several calls \r\nby women saying that they hear baby's cries outside their doors when they're home alone at night. \r\n\r\n* Please pass this on! and DO NOT open the door for a crying baby. This e-mail should probably be taken seriously because the Crying baby theory was mentioned on America's Most Wanted this past Saturday when they profiled the serial killer, in Louisiana. \r\n\r\n* Forward this message to all the women you know. It may save a life.\r\n\r\n* A candle is not dimmed by lighting another candle.\r\n \r\n* I was going to send this to the ladies only, but guys, if you love your mothers, wives, sisters, daughters, etc., you may want to pass  it onto them, as well.\r\n\r\nBe Smart, Safe, and have a nice Holiday in the coming weeks ahead!",

Would it be possible for the lawyer to come to my house?\" the elderly woman asked. The receptionist checked with the attorney who agreed and went to the spinster's home to discuss her estate and the will. \r\n\r\nThe lawyer's first question was, \"Would you please tell me what you have in assets and how you'd like them to be distributed under your will?\" \"I have $40,000 in my savings account at the bank,\" she replied.\r\n\"Tell me just how would you like the $40,000 to be distributed?\" the lawyer asked. \"Well, as I've told you, I've lived a reclusive life, people have hardly ever noticed me, so I'd like them to notice when I pass on,\" said the woman. \"I'd like to provide $35,000 for my funeral.\"\r\n \r\n\"Well, for $35,000 you will be able to have a funeral that will certainly be noticed and will leave a lasting impression on anyone who may not have taken much note of you!\" the lawyer exclaimed. \"I need to know, what would you like to do with the remaining $5,000?\"\r\nThe spinster replied, \"As you know, I've never married and the fact is I've never slept with a man. So before I die, I'd like you to use the $5,000 to arrange for a man to sleep with me just once.\" \"This is a very unusual request,\" the lawyer said, \"but I'll see what I can do to arrange it and get back to you.\"\r\n\r\nThat evening, the lawyer was at home telling his wife about the eccentric spinster and her weird request. After thinking about how much she could do around the house with $5,000 and with a bit of coaxing, she got her husband to agree to provide the service himself. The next morning, she drove him to the spinster's house and waited while he went in. She waited for over an hour, but her husband didn't come out, so she blew the car horn. Shortly, the upstairs bedroom window opened, the lawyer stuck his head out and yelled, \"Pick me up tomorrow, she's going to let the county bury her.\"",

He applies for a janitor's job at a large firm and easily passes an aptitude test.\r\nThe human resources manager tells him,  \"You will be hired at minimum wage of $5.35 an hour. Let me have your e-mail address so that we can get you in the loop. Our system will automatically e-mail you all the forms and advise you when to start and where to report on your first day.\"\r\n\r\nTaken back, the man protests that he is poor and has neither a computer nor an e-mail address.    To this the manager replies, \"You must understand that to a company like ours that means that you virtually do not exist. Without an e-mail address or internet access you can hardly expect to be employed by a high-tech firm. Good day.\"\r\n\r\nStunned, the man leaves. Not knowing where to turn and having $10 in his wallet, he walks past a farmers' market and sees a stand selling 25 lb. crates of beautiful red tomatoes. He buys a crate, carries it to a busy corner and displays the tomatoes. In less than two hours he sells all the tomatoes and makes 100% profit. Repeating the process several times more that day, he ends up with almost $100 and arrives home that night with several bags of groceries for his family.\r\n\r\nDuring the night he decides to repeat the tomato business the next day. By the end of the week he is getting up early every day and working into the night. He multiplies his profits quickly.    Early in the second week he acquires a cart to transport several boxes of tomatoes at a time, but before a month is up he sells the cart to buy a broken-down pickup truck.    At the end of a year he owns three old trucks. His two sons have left their neighborhood gangs to help him with the tomato business, his wife is purchasing the tomatoes he resells, and his daughter is taking night courses at the community college so she can keep books for him.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the second year he has a dozen very nice used trucks and employs fifteen previously unemployed people, all selling tomatoes. He continues to work hard.  Time passes and at the end of the fifth year he owns a fleet of nice trucks and a warehouse that his wife supervises, plus two tomato farms that the boys manage. The tomato company's payroll has put hundreds of homeless and jobless people to work. His daughter reports that the business grossed over one million dollars.    Planning for the future, he decides to buy some life insurance.\r\n\r\nConsulting with an insurance adviser, he picks an insurance plan to fit his new circumstances. Then the adviser asks him for his e-mail address in order to send the final documents electronically.    When the man replies that he doesn't have time to mess with a computer and has no e-mail address, the insurance man is stunned,    \"What, you don't have e-mail? No computer? No Internet? Just think where you would be today if you'd had all of that five years ago!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" snorts the man. \"If I'd had e-mail and the internet five years ago, I would be sweeping floors at Microsoft and making $5.35 an hour.\"\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to the moral of the story:    Since you got this story by e-mail, you're probably closer to being a janitor than a millionaire.\r\n\r\nSadly, I received it also.",

The convent once served as a base for the army of Attila the Hun. In more ancient times, a Greek temple to Eros, the god of love, occupied the hilltop site. The Huns are believed to have first collected and then destroyed a large gathering of Greek legal writs at the site. It is believed that Attila wanted to study the Greek legal system and had the writs and other documents brought to the temple. When the Greek Church took over the site in the 15th Century and the convent was built, church leaders ordered the pagan statue of Eros destroyed, so another ancient Greek treasure was lost. Today, there is only the lone sister, watching over the old Hun base.\r\nAnd that's how it ends: No Huns, no writs, no Eros, and nun left on base.",

It had the word \"Homework\" crossed out in a circle with a slash (the very same you see with no smoking signs)\r\n\"What is this?\" The mother said inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"Its a no homework pass mommy! I raised my hand the most in class.  All you have to do is sign it and I dont have to do any homework for tonight!\" says Johnny excitedly!\r\n\r\n'Well thats a good thing to keep kids interested in the subject and class participation. I bet this teacher's been teaching for quite a while!' thought his mother as she signed the slip for him.\r\n\r\n     So the next day Johnny comes home again just as excited.  He won another no homework pass.  His mother was starting to be very proud.  This happened every day for the whole nine weeks.\r\n     On report card day, Johnny came home with a D and she started to wonder if maybe he shouldnt be given so many no homework passes but when she asked him about it, he said that the tests were just very hard. \r\n\r\n\"Well that's allright Johnny, mommy didnt do very well on tests when she was a little girl either. But thats why you have to do your homework to keep up the test grades from making you to fail.\"\r\n\r\n      The same thing happened all next nine weeks with the no homework pass, and Johnny's mom was sure that her little boy was going to get an A next report card.  She started bragging to all her co-workers just how well little Johnny was doing.  Johnny's dad was hearing the good work that his son was doing and was boasting to all of his co-workers as well.  At the end of the nine-weeks, they both decided to have a party and let everyone see the big improvement their son was having from bringing that C up to an A.\r\n      On the big report card day, Mom and Dad were laughing and having a good time when Little Johnny came in the front door and saw all the guests his mom and dad had.  Taken aback by this, he asked his mom what was going on.\r\n\r\n\"This is for you honey! for doing so well in school! Show everyone your report card!\"\r\n\r\n\"Um mom... my teacher wants you to call her first before you open the report card?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh?\" she said? 'She must want to tell me what a great job Little Johnny's been doing!' she thought... so called the teacher and put her on loud speaker for everyone to hear.\r\n\r\n\"Ahem, Mrs. Gleason? Hi! This is Mrs. Clever! Little Johnny's mom! Im so happy you wanted to speak to me about my little boy!\" exclaimed Johnny's mom.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Clever? I'm not too sure what you're talking about... Did you see the report card?\"\r\n\r\n    Thinking this was the big moment, and she opened up the card to see the big F that Johnny came home with.  Obviously getting upset at the teacher because she knew immediately what happened... she spoke back very flustered.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Gleason! I am appalled! If johnny wasnt doing so well, why did you keep giving him the no homework passes that I was signing??\"\r\n\r\n\"N-n-no homework PASSES?\" a chuckling Mrs. Gleason started... \"no no no... They're no homework SLIPS, when the children dont do their homework! they have to get them signed and bring them back!\"\r\n\r\n\"....oh really...\" Mrs Clever started to eye little Johnny as he started backing away...\r\n\r\n\"You mean to tell me that he's been telling you they're no homework passes?\"\r\n\r\n..... So the next day, Johnny couldnt sit down very well.\r\n..... and the next day after that, Johnny had his homework.",

It was really bad. \r\nI was wearing a skirt and so, afer drenching my undies, it trickled down my legs, and since his legs were wrapped around mine,it trickled down his, too... \r\n\r\nWhen he felt it, he jumped up, saw my wet skirt, and yelled, \"Did u just pee all over me?\" which caused a HUGE disturbance as everyone turned to look at me. He goes, \"Well??!!\" so I hav to tell him yes and he yells for me to leave and to not come back.

Clarence lived a modestly comfortable existence on what he earned working at the Wal-Mart, but he always dreamed of being rich.\r\n\r\n\"Felix!\" he exclaimed one day, \"We're going to be rich! I'm going to teach you how to fly!\"\r\n\r\nFelix, of course, was terrified at the prospect: \"I can't fly, you idiot......\r\nI'm a frog, not a canary!\"\r\n\r\nClarence, disappointed at the initial reaction, told Felix: \"That negative attitude of yours could be a real problem. I'm sending you to class.\"\r\n\r\nSo Felix went to a three day class and learned about problem solving, time management, and effective communication.... but nothing about flying.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of \"flying lessons\", Clarence could barely control his excitement (and Felix could barely control his bladder). Clarence explained that their apartment had 15 floors, and each day Felix would jump out of a window starting with the first floor eventually getting to the top floor.\r\n\r\nAfter each jump, Felix would analyze how well he flew, isolate on the most effective flying techniques, and implement the improved process for the next flight. By the time they reached the top floor, Felix would surely be able to fly.\r\n\r\nFelix pleaded for his life, but it fell on deaf ears. \"He just doesn't understand how important this is...\" thought Clarence, \"but I won't let nay-sayers get in my way.\"\r\n\r\nSo, with that, Clarence opened the window and threw Felix out (who landed with a thud).\r\n\r\nNext day (poised for his second flying lesson) Felix again begged not to be thrown out of the window. With that, Clarence opened his pocket guide to Managing More Effectively and showed Felix the part about how one must always expect resistance when implementing new programs.\r\n\r\nAnd with that, he threw Felix out the window.(THUD)\r\n\r\nOn the third day (at the third floor) Felix tried a different ploy: stalling, he asked for a delay in the \"project\" until better weather would make flying conditions more favorable.\r\n\r\nBut Clarence was ready for him: he produced a timeline and pointed to the third milestone and asked, \"You don't want to slip the schedule do you?\"\r\n\r\nFrom his training, Felix knew that not jumping today would mean that he would have to jump TWICE tomorrow.... so he just said: \"OK. Let's go.\" And out the window he went.\r\n\r\nNow this is not to say that Felix wasn't trying his best. On the fifth day he flapped his feet madly in a vain attempt to fly. On the sixth day he tied a small red cape around his neck and tried to think \"Superman\" thoughts.\r\n\r\nBut try as he might, he couldn't fly.\r\n\r\nBy the seventh day, Felix (accepting his fate) no longer begged for mercy.... he simply looked at Clarence and said: \"You know you're killing me, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nClarence pointed out that Felix's performance so far had been less than exemplary, failing to meet any of the milestone goals he had set for him.\r\n\r\nWith that, Felix said quietly: \"Shut up and open the window,\" and he leaped out, taking careful aim on the large jagged rock by the corner of the building.\r\n\r\nAnd Felix went to that great lily pad in the sky.\r\n\r\nClarence was extremely upset, as his project had failed to meet a single goal that he set out to accomplish. Felix had not only failed to fly, he didn't even learn how to steer his flight as he fell like a sack of cement.... nor did he improve his productivity when Clarence had told him to \"Fall smarter, not harder.\"\r\n\r\nThe only thing left for Clarence to do was to analyze the process and try to determine where it had gone wrong.\r\n\r\nAfter much thought, Clarence smiled and said:\r\n\r\n\"Next time...... I'm getting a smarter frog!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\np.s.

Originally only came in an 8-oz. can, but now comes in a 16-oz. can. However, the can is divided into 8 compartments of 2 oz. each, which have to be accessed separately. Soon to be discontinued, although a lot of people are going to keep drinking it after it's no longer available.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------- \r\nMac Beer\r\nAt first, came only a 16-oz. can, but now comes in a 32-oz. can. Considered by many to be a \"light\" beer. All the cans look identical. When you take one from the fridge, it opens itself. The ingredients list is not on the can. If you call to ask about the ingredients, you are told that \"you don't need to know.\" A notice on the side reminds you to drag your empties to the trashcan.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------- \r\nWindows 3.1 Beer\r\nOnce considered the world's most popular beer. Comes in a 16-oz. can that looks a lot like Mac Beers. Requires that you already own a DOS Beer. Claims that it allows you to drink several DOS Beers simultaneously, but in reality you can only drink a few of them, very slowly, especially slowly if you are drinking the Windows Beer at the same time. Sometimes, for apparently no reason, a can of Windows Beer will explode when you open it.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------- \r\nOS/2 Beer\r\nComes in a 32-oz can. Does allow you to drink several DOS Beers simultaneously. Allows you to drink Windows 3.1 Beer simultaneously too, but somewhat slower. Advertises that its cans won't explode when you open them, even if you shake them up. You never really see anyone drinking OS/2 Beer, but the manufacturer (International Beer Manufacturing) claims that 9 million six-packs have been sold. \r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nWindows 95 Beer\r\nThe can looks a lot like Mac Beer's can, but tastes more like Windows 3.1 Beer. It comes in 32-oz. cans, but when you look inside, the cans only have 16 oz. of beer in them. Most people will probably keep drinking Windows 3.1 Beer until their friends try Windows 95 Beer and say they like it. The ingredients list, when you look at the small print, has some of the same ingredients that come in DOS beer, even though the manufacturer claims that this is an entirely new brew.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------- \r\nWindows NT Beer\r\nComes in 32-oz. cans, but you can only buy it by the truckload. This causes most people to have to go out and buy bigger refrigerators. The can looks just like Windows 95 Beer. Touted as an \"industrial strength\" beer, and suggested only for use in bars.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------- \r\nWindows 98 Beer\r\nMillions sampled Windows95 beer and noticed that it was often flat, right out of the can. The manufacturer of Windows95 beer decided to re-release it as Windows98 beer and guarantee it's freshness. Most consumers are skeptical of the manufacturer's claims, and will continue to drink flat Windows95 beer because they have acquired the taste for it.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------- \r\nWindows 2000 Beer\r\nThe manufacturer of the Windows line of beers says this will be \"the\" beer, if they can just finish playing with the ingredients. This beer will have many ingredients of Windows 95/98 and NT beers. Many drinkers in the future will be forced to drink this when they get thirsty since they won't be able to find Windows 95 or 98 or NT beer on the shelves. According to manufacturer it's combines the greatest taste ever with almost no calories. Only one problem, the cans explode without warning and take out half the refrigerator with them.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------- \r\nUnix Beer\r\nComes in several different brands, in cans ranging from 8 oz. to 64 oz. Drinkers of Unix Beer display fierce brand loyalty, even though they claim that all the different brands taste almost identical. Sometimes the pop-tops break off when you try to open them, so you have to have your own can opener around for those occasions, in which case you either need a complete set of instructions or a friend who has been drinking Unix Beer for several years.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------- \r\nLinux Beer\r\nLINUX beer tastes just like Unix beer. Like Unix beer, Linux beer is intended for expert beer drinkers only. It originally had no pop tops or cans because you had to brew it yourself. First you would get a recipe and some yeast from a Unix guru. Then go plow a field, plant your barley and hops. After harvest you would take your Kernels and put them into a barrel full of water, then you just add your yeast close the lid, and let your beer compile. After all this you have what experts claim to be one of the Worlds Best Beers. Linux beers do not normally explode but many brewers have been known to. Linux beer is now available from some Micro Brewerys in handy pop top versions for easy drinking by beginner Unix or Linux beer drinkers. Keep your can openers handy.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------- \r\nAmigaDOS Beer\r\nThe company has gone out of business, but their recipe has been picked up by some weird German company, so now this beer will be an import. This beer never really sold very well because the original manufacturer didn't understand marketing. Like Unix Beer, AmigaDOS Beer fans are an extremely loyal and loud group. It originally came in a 16-oz. can, but now comes in 32-oz. cans too. When this can was originally introduced, it appeared flashy and colorful, but the design hasn't changed much over the years, so it appears dated now. Critics of this beer claim that it is only meant for watching TV anyway.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------- \r\nVMS Beer\r\nRequires minimal user interaction, except for popping the top and sipping. However cans have been known on occasion to explode, or contain extremely un-beer-like contents. Best drunk in high pressure development environments. When you call the manufacturer for the list of ingredients, you're told that is proprietary and referred to an unknown listing in the manuals published by the FDA. Rumors are that this was once listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference as a tranquilizer, but no one can claim to have actually seen it.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nWindows xp beer\r\nA beer that can be enjoyed at home or at the office. Like tequila however, many cans are prone to have a fat, juicy worm inside. This brew is also highly susceptible to theft. If this occurs, there is no limit to how much damage can be inflicted. If that weren't enough, u can forget about refrigerating this drink, since that won't stop the hordes of viruses it will accumulate.",

Never leave diskettes in the disk drive, as data can leak out of the disk and corrode the inner mechanics of the drive. Diskettes should be rolled up and stored in pencil holders. \r\n\r\n2. Diskettes should be cleaned and waxed once a week. Microscopic metal particles can be removed by waving a powerful magnet over the surface of the disk. Any stubborn metallic shavings can be removed with scouring powder and soap. When waxing the diskettes, make sure the surface is even. This will allow the diskette to spin faster, resulting in better access time. \r\n\r\n3. Do not fold diskettes unless they do not fit into the drive. \"Big\" diskettes may be folded and used in \"little\" disk drives. \r\n\r\n4. Never insert a diskette into the drive upside down. The data can fall off the surface of the disk and jam the intricate mechanics of the drive. \r\n\r\n5. Diskettes cannot be backed up by running them through the xerox machine. If your data is going to need to be backed up, simply insert two diskettes into the drive. Whenever you update a document, the data will be written on both diskettes. \r\n\r\n6. Diskettes should not be inserted or removed from the drive while the red light is flashing. Doing so could result in smeared or possibly unreadable text. Occasionally the red light remains flashing in what is known as a \"hung\" or \"hooked\" state. If your system is \"hooking\" you will probably need to insert a few coins before being allowed access to the slot. \r\n\r\n7. If your diskette is full and you need more storage space, remove the disk from the drive and shake vigorously for 2 minutes. This will pack the data enough (Data Compression) to allow for more storage. Be sure to cover all the openings with scotch tape to prevent loss data. \r\n\r\n8. Access time can be greatly improved by cutting more holes in the diskette jacket. This will provide more simultaneous access points to the disk. \r\n\r\n9. Diskettes may be used as coasters for beverage glasses, provided that they are properly waxed beforehand. Be sure to wipe the diskettes dry before using. (see item 2 above) \r\n\r\n10. Never use scissors and glue to manually edit documents. The data is stored much too small for the naked eye, and you may end up with data from some other document stuck in the middle of your document. Razor blades and scotch tape may be used, however, provided the user is equipped with an electron microscope. \r\n\r\n11. Periodically spray diskettes with insecticide to prevent system bugs from spreading.",

That is, unless you keep pulling the stick all the way back, then they get bigger again. \r\n\r\n3. Flying isn't dangerous. Crashing is what's dangerous. \r\n\r\n4. It's always better to be down here wishing you were up there than up there wishing you were down here. \r\n\r\n5. The ONLY time you have too much fuel is when you're on fire. \r\n\r\n6. The propeller is just a big fan in front of the plane used to keep the pilot cool. Because when it stops, you can actually watch the pilot start sweating. \r\n\r\n7. When in doubt, hold on to your altitude. No one has ever collided with the sky. \r\n\r\n8. A 'good' landing is one from which you can walk away. A 'great' landing is one after which they can use the plane again. \r\n\r\n9. Learn from the mistakes of others. You won't live long enough to make all of them yourself. \r\n\r\n10. You know you've landed with the wheels up if it takes full power to taxi to the ramp. \r\n\r\n11. The probability of survival is inversely proportional to the angle of arrival. Large angle of arrival, small probability of survival and vice-versa. \r\n\r\n12. Never let an aircraft take you somewhere your brain didn't get to five minutes earlier. \r\n\r\n13. Stay out of clouds. The silver lining everyone keeps talking about might be another airplane going in the opposite direction. Reliable sources also report that mountains have been known to hide out in clouds. \r\n\r\n14. Always try to keep the number of landings you make equal to the number of take offs you've made. \r\n\r\n15. There are three simple rules for making a smooth landing. Unfortunately no one knows what they are. \r\n\r\n16. You start with a bag full of luck and an empty bag of experience. The trick is to fill the bag of experience before you empty the bag of luck. \r\n\r\n17. Helicopters can't fly; they're just so ugly the earth repels them. \r\n\r\n18. If all you can see out of the window is ground that's going round and round and all you can hear is commotion coming from the passenger compartment, things are not at all as they should be. \r\n\r\n19. In the ongoing battle between objects made of aluminum going hundreds of miles per hour and the ground going zero miles per hour, the ground has yet to lose. \r\n\r\n20. Good judgment comes from experience. Unfortunately, experience usually comes from bad judgment. \r\n\r\n21. It's always a good idea to keep the pointy end going forward as much as possible. \r\n\r\n22. Keep looking around. There's always something you've missed. \r\n\r\n23. Remember, gravity is not just a good idea. It's the law. And it's not subject to repeal. \r\n\r\n24. The four most useless things to a pilot are the altitude above you, runway behind you, gas back at the airport, and a tenth of a second ago. \r\n\r\n25.

        "body": "Dear Bob in Tech Support,\r\n\r\nI'm currently running the latest version of GirlFriend and I've been having some problems lately. I've been running the same version of DrinkingBuddies 1.0 forever, as my primary application, and all the GirlFriend releases I've\r\ntried have always conflicted with it.\r\n\r\nI hear that DrinkingBuddies won't crash if GirlFriend is run in background mode and the sound is turned off, but I'm embarrassed to say I can't find the switch to turn the sound off. I just run them separately, and it works\r\nokay. GirlFriend also seems to have a problem co-existing with my Leisure 3.1 and QuietTime programs, often trying to abort them with some sort of timing incompatibility.\r\n\r\nI probably should have stayed with GirlFriend 1.0, but I thought I might see better performance from GirlFriend 2.0. After months of conflicts and other problems, I consulted a friend who has had experience with GirlFriend 2.0. He said I probably didn't have enough cache to run GirlFriend 2.0, and eventually it would require a Token Ring to run properly. He was right - as soon as I purged my cache, it uninstalled itself.\r\n\r\nShortly after that, I installed GirlFriend 3.0 beta. All the bugs were supposed to be gone, but the first time I used it, it gave me a virus anyway. I had to clean out my whole system and shut down for a while to re-check my hardware.\r\n\r\nI very cautiously upgraded to GirlFriend 4.0. This time I used a SCSI probe first and also installed a virus protection program. It worked okay for a while, until I discovered that GirlFriend 1.0 was still in my system. I\r\ntried running GirlFriend 1.0 again with GirlFriend 4.0 still installed, but GirlFriend 4.0 has a \"feature\" I didn't know about that automatically detects the presence of any other version of GirlFriend and communicates with it in the background in some way, which results in the immediate removal of both versions.\r\n\r\nThe version I have now works pretty well, but there are still some problems. Like all versions of GirlFriend, it is written in some obscure language I can't understand, much less reprogram. Frankly I think there is too much attention paid to the look and feel rather than the desired functionality. Also, to get the best connections with your hardware, you usually have to use gold-plated contacts, which is very expensive. And I've never liked how GirlFriend is totally \"object-oriented\", as that interface is sometimes cumbersome and even counter-intuitive.\r\n\r\nA year ago, a friend of mine upgraded his version of GirlFriend to GirlFriendPlus 1.1, which is a Terminate and Stay Resident version of GirlFriend. To his dismay, however, he discovered that GirlFriendPlus 1.1 expires within a year of the upgrade, if you don't upgrade AGAIN to Fiancee 1.0. So he did, but soon after that, he had to upgrade YET AGAIN to Wife 1.0, which he describes as a HUGE resource hog.\r\n\r\nIt has taken up all his space, so he can't load anything else. In fact, it has even automatically deleted several of his other programs to make room for itself, not the least of which was DrinkingBuddies 1.0, which used to be one of his favorite applications, as well. This is particularly disturbing to me, as we used to run DrinkingBuddies 1.0 on a network with several of our mutual friends, and now he can't even connect any more!\r\n\r\nHe told me that one of the primary reasons he decided to go with Wife 1.0 was because it came bundled with FreeSexPlus, which sounded great. Well, it turns out the resource allocation module of Wife 1.0 sometimes inexplicably\r\nprohibits access to FreeSexPlus, particularly when he starts the new Plug-Ins he wanted to try. Also, for no apparent reason, the OralSex 1.0 module that worked fine in his previous versions of GirlFriendPlus and Fiancee, stopped working the instant the upgrade to Wife 1.0 finished\r\ninstalling.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, Wife 1.0 must be running on a well warmed-up system before he can do anything with the FreeSexPlus module. This warming up process requires him to run an antiquated version of ForePlay Beta, which has an\r\nagonizingly slow interface, and which has an unfortunate tendency to crash, requiring a cold reboot to his system. The real insult to injury however, is that even though he did not ask for it, Wife 1.0 came embedded with MotherInLaw 2.0, which has an irritating automatic pop-up feature he can't turn off.\r\n\r\nI told him to try installing Mistress 1.0 (which I had heard works great in such situations), but he said he heard if you try to run it without first uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete all of your MSMoney files before doing an uninstall of itself; then Mistress 1.0 won't install anyway because of insufficient resources.\r\n\r\nPlease help me Bob, I don't know what to do. Since the initial release, I have had nothing but problems.\r\n\r\nI've heard that I would really like the CoolGirlFriend 1.0 Deluxe Upgrade (which is supposed to come bundled with a completely functioning version of FreeSexDeluxe), but that release is no where to be found - not even the Beta version! That release is also supposed to come with its own resource management module seamlessly layered in, so it won't conflict with any of my other programs (barring previous versions of GirlFriend, which I would happily delete!).\r\n\r\nPlease advise.",

These last two weeks have been hell.  Your boss called to tell me that you had quit your job today and that was the last straw.  Last week, you came home and didn't notice that I had gotten my hair and nails done, cooked your favorite meal and even wore a brand new negligee.  You came home and ate in two minutes, and went straight to sleep after watching the game.  You don't tell me you love me anymore, you don't touch me or anything.  Either you're cheating or you don't love me anymore, whatever the case is, I'm gone.\r\n\r\nP.S.  If you're trying to find me, don't. Your BROTHER and I are moving away to West Virginia together! Have a great life! \r\n\r\n\r\n                       Your EX-Wife\r\n\r\nDear Ex-Wife\r\nNothing has made my day more than receiving your letter.  It's true that you and I have been married for seven years, although a good woman is a far cry from what you've been.  I watch sports so much to try to drown out your constant nagging.  Too bad that doesn't work.  I did notice when you cut off all of your hair last week, the first thing that came to mind was, \"You look just like a man!\"  My mother raised me to not say anything if you can't say anything nice.  When you cooked my favorite meal, you must have gotten me confused with MY BROTHER, because I stopped eating pork seven years ago.  I went to sleep on you when you had on that new negligee because the price tag was still on it.  I prayed that it was a coincidence that my brother had just borrowed fifty dollars from me that\r\nmorning and your negligee was $49.99.  After all of this, I still loved you and felt that we could work it out, so when I discovered that I had hit the lotto for ten million dollars, I quit my job and bought us two tickets to Jamaica. But when I got home you were gone.  Everything happens for a reason, I guess.  I hope you have the filling life you always wanted.  My lawyer said with your letter that you wrote, you won't get a dime from me. So take care.\r\n\r\nP.S.  I don't know if I ever told you this but Carl, my brother, was born Carla.

O07?\r\n\r\nShaken not stirred? Tuxedo? The trunk-sized jet pack? We had a run in with an Austrian terrorist with the overdeveloped reptilian brain and a predilection for man-eating octopi launching bazookas?\r\n\r\nWell, contacting you took quite a bit of doing actually. You see, first I tried Giganta Loins. I must have looked in every phone directory that MI-6 could hack into. Then I figured out that Giganta might be a code name. I mean, who has the name Giganta Loins? Rather silly, when you think about it.\r\n\r\nYes, yes I suppose you do like it. Anyway, I recalled that I kept one of your garments \u00e2\u0080\u0093 your knickers actually. And there it was. Honey Rider is a much prettier and commonplace name. You should use that.\r\n\r\nAh, yes. The, uh... point. Well, it seems that... well, there''s no delicate way to put this. I have a rather nasty case of syphilis. And, um, I''m calling all my sexual partners to let them know that they should go get tested.\r\n\r\nUh-huh. Right. I know it was ten years ago. But the syphilis is rather unusual.\r\n\r\nWell, it has gonorrhea.\r\n\r\nYes, my syphilis has gonorrhea.\r\n\r\nAnd the gonorrhea has lice. And the lice have some undiscovered disease that''s kind of between hemorrhagic fever and the mumps. It's a virulent mutant strand developed by Dr. No-Means-Yes during mission: \"The Russian Spy Who Loved To Thunderball Me.\"\r\n\r\nYes, I know I said I had a condom. But you see all the condoms I had were made by Q, and apparently, the condoms weren't meant to be condoms -- they were designed to be used as a pocket parachute. Good man. If you need to have your stapler work as a gun, he''s your boy. Anyway, you didn't notice because while we were passionately embraced, your tongue accidentally trigged my knockout gas tooth and you, um, drifted off to sleep. But trust me, you enjoyed yourself. They all do.\r\n\r\nAnyway, with all the rather bizarre ailments my, um, bizarre ailments have, the doctors have advised me to contact everyone in my sexual history about my condition. No small feat, I assure you. If you saw the list, you''d think I''d been having sex with my fellow spies for 50 years!\r\n\r\nWell, this is what the doctors suggest. Right now, I am in a remote island facility. Actually there''s no facility. Just an island. And me. But they''re building one as soon as they can find enough hazmat suits. Anyway, a helicopter is going to pick you up and bring you to the island where we can be treated in isolation.\r\n\r\nChin up! Look at it this way: it''ll give us a chance to get caught up. And maybe once some of the redness goes down, along with some of the greenness and the larvae, we can do some REAL reminiscing.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, James.\" What''s that supposed to mean?",

In a couple of days Mr. Steinberg's physician comes into his room and says, \r\n\r\n\"Sol, I'm happy to tell you that you are completely well. You have the heart function that you did when you were a fifteen-year-old lad. We're going to send you home tomorrow. You don't have to worry about your heart; do any physical exercise that you like.\" \r\n\r\nMr. Steinberg goes home and that evening is talking with his wife: \r\n\r\n\"Doris, you'll never believe it: I'm completely well. I have no worries with my heart. Tonight, Darling, you and I are going to make love like you've never had before, wild, passionate sex... you'll love it!\" \r\n\r\nDoris thinks for a minute and says, \r\n\"I don't know, Sol. I've heard about active sex and heart conditions. I don't want it to be on my head if you croak while we are making love. Maybe, just maybe, if your doctor wrote a note to me saying that everything was OK...maybe I would have such sex with you...\" \r\n\r\nMr. Steinberg was dejected, but the next day he was in his doctor's office; his doctor tells him: \"Sure, sure, Sol, no problem, I'll write the note. Let's see, here's my prescription pad: \r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sol Steinberg, a patient of mine, has the heart function of a fifteen-year-old lad and can have mad, passionate, adventurous sex any time that he so desires, signed, Dr. Aaron Katz... Now, I'll just address this... By the way, Sol, what's your wife's first name?\"",

After putting in sixty cents, a root beer popped out of the machine. She set it on the ground, put sixty more cents into the machine, and pushes another button; suddenly, a coke comes out the machine!\r\n\r\nShe continued to do this until a man waiting to use the machine became impatient. \"Excuse me, can I get my soda and then you can go back to whatever stupid thing you are doing?\"\r\n\r\nThe blonde turns around and says, \"Yeah right! I'm not giving up this machine while I'm still winning!\"\r\n\r\n4 A blonde reports for her university final exam which consists of mainly true or false questions. She takes her seat in the examination hall and stares at the question paper for five minutes. Then, in a fit of inspiration, takes her purse out, removes a coin and starts tossing the coin and marking the answer sheet: true for heads and false for tails. Within thirty minutes she is all done, whereas the rest of the class is still working furiously.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few minutes, she is seen desperately throwing the coin, swearing and sweating. The moderator, alarmed, approaches her and asks what is happening.\r\n\r\n\"I finished the exam in a half hour,\" she replies. \"Now I'm rechecking my answers.\"\r\n\r\n5  A blonde decides to try to learn horse back riding unassisted without prior experience or lessons. She mounts the horse with great effort, and the tall, shiny horse springs into motion.\r\n\r\nIt gallops along at a steady and rhythmic pace, but the blonde begins to slip from the saddle. Out of sheer terror, she grabs for the horse's mane but cannot seem to get a firm grip. She tries to throw her arms around the horse's neck, but she slides down the side of the horse anyway. The horse gallops along, seemingly oblivious to its slipping rider.\r\n\r\nFinally, giving up her frail grip, she leaps away from the horse to try and throw herself to safety.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, her foot has become entangled in the stirrup. She is now at the mercy of the horse's pounding hooves as her head is struck against the ground again and again. She is mere moments away from unconsciousness or even death when Frank, the Wal-Mart manager runs out to shut the horse off.",

As they walked along, they came upon a cigarette butt lying on the ground, still burning.\r\n\r\nThe homosexual looked at the chain smoker and said, \"If you bend over to pick that up, we're both dead.\"",

Those that don't, have incredibly powerful text-bases command shells that can correctly understand and execute commands typed in plain English. \r\n\r\nCorollary: you can gain access to any information you want by simply typing \"ACCESS ALL OF THE SECRET FILES\" on any keyboard. \r\n\r\nLikewise, you can infect a computer with a destructive virus by simply typing \"UPLOAD VIRUS\" (see \"Fortress\"). \r\n\r\nAll computers are connected. You can access the information on the villain's desktop computer, even if it's turned off. \r\n\r\nPowerful computers beep whenever you press a key or whenever the screen changes. Some computers also slow down the output on the screen so that it doesn't go faster than you can read. The *really* advanced ones also emulate the sound of a dot-matrix printer. \r\n\r\nAll computer panels have thousands of volts and flash pots just underneath the surface. Malfunctions are indicated by a bright flash, a puff of smoke, a shower of sparks, and an explosion that forces you backwards. \r\n\r\nPeople typing away on a computer will turn it off without saving the data. \r\n\r\nA hacker can get into the most sensitive computer in the world before intermission and guess the secret password in two tries. \r\n\r\nAny PERMISSION DENIED has an OVERRIDE function (see \"Demolition Man\" and countless others). \r\n\r\nComplex calculations and loading of huge amounts of data will be accomplished in under three seconds. Movie modems usually appear to transmit data at the speed of two gigabytes per second. \r\n\r\nWhen the power plant/missile site/whatever overheats, all the control panels will explode, as will the entire building. \r\n\r\nIf a disk has got encrypted files, you are automatically asked for a password when you try to access it. \r\n\r\nNo matter what kind of computer disk it is, it'll be readable by any system you put it into.

But if Mike, Phil, Rob and Jack go out for a brewsky, they will affectionately refer to each other as Fat Boy, Godzilla, Peanut-Head and Useless. \r\n\r\nEATING OUT: And when the check comes, Mike, Phil, Rob and Jack will each throw in $20 bills, even though it's only for $22.50. None of them will have anything smaller, and none will actually admit they want change back. When the girls get their check, out come the pocket calculators. \r\n\r\nBATHROOMS: A man has six items in his bathroom-a toothbrush, shaving cream, razor, a bar of Dial soap, and a towel from the Holiday Inn. The average number of items in the typical woman's bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items. \r\n\r\nGROCERIES: A woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes out to the store and buys these things. A man waits till the only items left in his fridge are half a lime and a soda. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reaches the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter than the Clampett's car on Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 10-items-or-less lane. \r\n\r\nSHOES: When preparing for work, a woman will put on a Mondi wool suit, then slip on Reebok sneakers. She will carry her dress shoes in a plastic bag from Saks. When a woman gets to work, she will put on her dress shoes. Five minutes later, she will kick them off because her feet are under the desk. A man will wear the same pair of shoes all day. \r\n\r\nCATS: Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren't looking, men kick cats. \r\n\r\nDRESSING UP: A woman will dress up to: go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, get the mail. A man will dress up for: weddings, funerals. \r\n\r\nLAUNDRY: Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul and take his mountain of clothes to the Laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the Laundromat. This is a myth perpetuated by re-runs of old episodes of \"Love, American Style.\" \r\n\r\nOFFSPRING: Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.",

        "body": "IDIOTS IN SERVICE\r\nThis week, all our office phones went dead and I had to contact the telephone repair people. They promised to be out between 8:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. When I asked if they could give me a smaller time window, the pleasant gentleman asked, \"Would you like us to call you before we come?\" I replied that I didn't see how he would be able to do that, since our phones weren't working. He also requested that we report future outages by email (Does YOUR email work without a telephone line?).\r\n\r\nIDIOTS AT WORK\r\nI was signing the receipt for my credit card purchase when the clerk noticed I had never signed my name on the back of the credit card. She informed me that she could not complete the transaction unless the card was signed. When I asked why, she explained that it was necessary to compare the signature I had just signed on the receipt. So I signed the credit card in front of her. She carefully compared the signature to the one I had just signed on the receipt. As luck\r\nwould have it, they matched.\r\n\r\nIDIOTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD:\r\nI live in a semi-rural area. We recently had a new neighbor call the local township administrative office to request the removal of the Deer Crossing sign on our road. The reason: too many deer were being hit by cars and he didn't want them to cross there anymore.\r\n\r\nIDIOTS IN FOOD SERVICE:\r\nMy daughter went to a local Taco Bell and ordered a taco. She asked the person behind the counter for \"minimal lettuce.\" He said he was sorry, but they only had iceberg.\r\n\r\nIDIOT SIGHTING #1:\r\nI was at the airport, checking in at the gate when an airport employee asked, \"Has anyone put anything in your baggage without your knowledge?\" To which I replied, \"If it was without my knowledge, how would I know?\" He smiled knowingly and nodded, \"That's why we ask.\"\r\n\r\nIDIOT SIGHTING #2:\r\nThe stoplight on the corner buzzes when it's safe to cross the street. I was crossing with an intellectually challenged coworker of mine when she asked if I knew what the buzzer was for. I explained that it signals blind people when the light is red. Appalled, she responded, \"What on earth are blind people doing driving?!\"\r\n\r\nIDIOT SIGHTING #3:\r\nAt a good-bye luncheon for an old and dear coworker who was leaving the company due to \"downsizing,\" our manager commented cheerfully, \"This is fun.\" We should do this more often.\" Not a word was spoken. We all just looked at each other with that deer-in-the-headlights stare.\r\n\r\nIDIOT SIGHTING #4:\r\nI work with an individual who plugged her power strip back into itself and for the life of her couldn't understand why her system I would not turn on.\r\n\r\nIDIOT SIGHTING #5:\r\nWhen my husband and I arrived at an automobile dealership to pick up our car, we were told the keys had been locked in it. We went to the service department and found a mechanic working feverishly to unlock the driver's side door. As I watched from the passenger side, I instinctively tried the door handle and discovered that it was unlocked. \"Hey,\" I announced to the technician, \"It's open!\" To which he replied, \"I know - I already got that side.\"\r\nNOW DON'T YOU FEEL BETTER?",

She's the only one who knows where the scotch tape  is.\r\n\r\n2. Mostly to clean the house.\r\n\r\n3. To help us out of there when we were  getting born. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow did God make mothers?\r\n\r\n1. He  used dirt, just like for the rest of us.\r\n\r\n2. Magic, plus super powers, and a lot  of stirring.\r\n\r\n3. God made my mom just the same like he made me. He just used bigger parts.\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat ingredients are mothers made  of?\r\n\r\n1. God makes mothers out of clouds and angel hair and  everything nice in the world, and one dab of mean.\r\n\r\n2.  They had to get their start from men's bones. Then they mostly use string, I think.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhy did  God give you your mother and not some other mom?\r\n\r\n1. We're  related.\r\n\r\n2 . God knew she likes me a lot more than other people's  moms like me.\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat kind of little girl was your  mom? \r\n\r\n1. My mom has always been my mom and none of that other  stuff.\r\n\r\n2. I don't know because I wasn't there, but my guess would  be pretty bossy.\r\n\r\n3. They say she used to be  nice.\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat did Mom need to know about Dad before she married  him?\r\n\r\n1. His last  name.\r\n\r\n2. She had to know his background. Like is he a crook? Does he  get drunk on beer?\r\n\r\n3. Does he make at least $800 a year? Did  he say NO to drugs and YES to chores?\r\n \r\n\r\nWhy did your mom marry your  dad?\r\n \r\n1. My dad makes  the best spaghetti in the world. And my mom eats a lot.\r\n\r\n2. She got too old to  do anything else with him.\r\n\r\n3. My grandma says that Mom didn't have her  thinking cap on.\r\n \r\n\r\nWho's the boss at your  house?\r\n\r\n1. Mom doesn't  want to be boss, but she has to because dad's such a goof ball.\r\n\r\n2. Mom. You can tell by room inspection. She sees the stuff under the  bed. \r\n\r\n3. I guess Mom is, but only because she has a lot more to do than Dad.\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat's the difference between moms and  dads?\r\n\r\n1. Moms work at work & work at home, & dads just go  to work at work.\r\n\r\n2. Moms know how to talk to teachers without  scaring them.\r\n\r\n3. Dads are taller & stronger, but moms have all the real  power, because that's who you got to ask if you want to sleep over at your friends.\r\n\r\n4. Moms have magic. They make you feel better without  medicine.\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat does your mom do in her spare  time?\r\n\r\n1. Mothers don't do spare time.\r\n\r\n2. To hear her tell it,  she pays bills all day long.\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat would it take to make your mom  perfect?\r\n\r\n1. On the inside she's already perfect. Outside, I think some kind of plastic surgery.\r\n\r\n2. Diet. You know, her hair.  I'd diet, maybe blue.\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you could change one thing about  your mom, what would it be?\r\n\r\n1. She has this weird thing about me keeping my room clean.  I'd get rid of that.\r\n\r\n2. I'd make my mom smarter. Then she  would know it was my sister who did it and not me.\r\n\r\n3. I  would like for her to get rid of those invisible eyes on her back.",

Where would you  bury the survivors?   East Germany or West Germany or in \"no man's land\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n! \r\n \r\nAnswer: You don't, of course, bury survivors.   \r\n \r\nIf you said ANYTHING else, you are a real dunce and you must NEVER try to rescue anyone from a plane crash.

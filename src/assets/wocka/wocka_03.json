There had better be some changes around here this Christmas, or I'm gonna call for a nationwide meltdown (and trust me, you won't wanna be around to smell it). So, here's my holiday wish list! \r\n\r\n1. A nice, comfy pair of sweat pants and a frumpy, oversized sweatshirt. I'm sick of looking like a hooker. How much smaller are these bathing suits gonna get? Do you have any idea what it feels like to have nylon and velcro crawling up your butt? \r\n\r\n2. Real underwear that can be pulled on and off. Preferably white. What bonehead at Mattel decided to cheap out and MOLD imitation underwear to my skin?!? It looks like cellulite! \r\n\r\n3. A REAL man...maybe GI Joe. Heck, I'd take Tickle-Me Elmo over that wimped-out excuse for a boytoy Ken. And what's with that earring anyway? If I'm gonna have to suffer with him, at least make him (and me) anatomically correct. \r\n\r\n4. Arms that actually bend so I can push the aforementioned Ken-wimp away once he is anatomically correct. \r\n \r\n\r\n5. A new career. Pet doctor and school teacher just don't cut it. How about a systems analyst? Or better yet, a public relations senior account exec! \r\n\r\n6. A new, more 90s persona. Maybe \"PMS Barbie\", complete with a miniature container of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and a bag of chips; \"Animal Rights Barbie\", with my very own paint gun, outfitted with a fake fur coat, bottle of spray on blood and handcuffs; or \"Stop Smoking Barbie,\" sporting a removable Nicotrol patch and equipped with several packs of gum. \r\n\r\n7. No more McDonald's endorsements. The grease is wrecking my vinyl. \r\n\r\n8. Mattel stock options. It's been 37 years--I think I deserve it. \r\n\r\nOk, Santa, that's it. Considering my valuable contribution to society, I don't think these requests are out of line. If you disagree, then you can find yourself a new barbie for next Christmas. \r\n\r\nIt's that simple. \r\n\r\nYours truly, \r\nBarbie",

So he gets up, and peeks under the rug.\r\n\r\nIt's a trapdoor. \"OK, I can live with that,\" he says to himself, and goes to bed.\r\n\r\nThe next night, he can't sleep. He's wondering what's under the trapdoor.

Just before he reentered the lander, however, he made the enigmatic remark \"Good luck Mr. Gorsky.\"\r\n\r\nMany people at NASA thought it was a casual remark concerning some rival Soviet Cosmonaut. However, upon checking, there was no Gorsky in either the Russian or American Space Programs. Over the years many people questioned Mr. Armstrong as to what the \"Good Luck Mr. Gorsky\" statement meant, but Mr. Armstrong always just smiled and would not answer.\r\n\r\nJust last year, (On July 5, 1996) in Tampa, Florida while answering questions following a speech, a reporter brought up the 29 year old question to Mr. Armstrong again. This time he finally responded. Mr. Gorsky had finally died and so Neil Armstrong felt he could answer the question.... When he was a kid, he was playing baseball with a friend in his backyard. His friend hit a fly ball which landed in the front of his neighbor's bedroom windows. His neighbors were Mr. and Mrs. Gorsky. As he leaned down to pick up the ball, the then young Neil Armstrong heard Mrs. Gorsky shouting at Mr. Gorsky saying \"Oral Sex! You want oral sex? You'll get oral sex when the kid next door walks on the moon!\"",

In his highly aroused state, her husband readily agreed.\r\nThis scenario was repeated each time they made love, for more than 30 years, with him thinking that it was a cute way for her to afford new clothes and other incidentals that she needed. Arriving home around noon one day, she was surprised to find her husband in a very drunken state. During the next few minutes, he explained that his employer was going through a process of corporate downsizing, and he had been let go. It was unlikely that, at the age of 59, he'd be able to find another position that paid anywhere near what he'd been earning, and therefore, they were financially ruined. Calmly, his wife handed him a bank book which showed more than thirty years of steady deposits and interest totaling nearly$1 million. Then she showed him certificates of deposits issued by the bank which were worth over $2 million, and informed him that they were one of the largest depositors in the bank.\r\nShe explained that for the more than three decades she had \"charged\" him for sex, these holdings had multiplied and these were the results of her savings and investments. Faced with evidence of cash and investments worth over $3 million, her husband was so astounded he could barely speak, but finally he found his voice and blurted out, \"If I'd had any idea what you were doing, I would have given you all my business!\"\r\nThat's when she shot him.",

Sure enough the guy hears a voice \"Hey Hey I'm the ghost of Green Gables lay you money on the tables\".  He throws his money down the hole and runs down stairs and tries to tell the third guuy who does not listen.\r\n\r\nThe third guy runs up the stairs and sits on the toilet and hears a voice \"Hey Hey I'm the ghost of Green Gables lay your money on the tables\".  The guy just sits there, five minutes later the chant comes again \"Hey Hey I'm the ghost of Green Gables lay your money on the tables.\"  The guy stands up and yells down the hole \"HEY HEY I'M THE GHOST OF DAVEY CROCKET AND MY MONEY'S STAYING IN MY DAMN POCKET!!\"",

He thought \"Wow, these gals really have it nice!\" \r\n\r\nSo a little more boldly he pressed the WA button and body temperature Warm Air blew across his wet bottom and dried it comfortably. \r\n\r\n\"Aha,\" he thought, \"no wonder these women take so long in the bathroom with these kinds of services!\" \r\n\r\nSo he pushed the next button PP with anticipation. A soft disposable Powder Puff swung below him and dusted his bottom lightly with talc. \r\n\r\n\"Man, this is great,\" he thought as he reached out for the ATR button. \r\n\r\nWhen he awoke in the hospital, the morphine was just wearing off. Confused, he buzzed the nurse to find out what happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nHe said the last thing he remembered was intense pain in the ladies' room on the plane. \r\n\r\nThe nurse explained, \"Yes, you must have been having a great time until you pushed the Automatic Tampon Removal button.\"",

In early October [2005] a major research institution announced discovery of the heaviest element yet known to science. The new element has been named \"Government.\" \r\n\r\nGovernmentium (Gv) has one neutron, 25 assistant neutrons, 88 deputy neutrons, and 198 assistant deputy neutrons, giving it an atomic mass of 312. \r\n\r\nThese 312 particles are held together by forces called morons, which are surrounded by vast quantities of lepton like particles called peons. Since Gv has no electrons, it is inert. However, it can be detected, because it impedes every reaction with which it comes into contact. A minute amount of Gv causes one reaction to take over four days to complete, when it would normally take less than a second! \r\n\r\nGv has a normal half-life of 4 years; it does not decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which a portion of the assistant neutrons and deputy neutrons exchange places. In fact, Governmentium's mass will actually increase over time, since each reorganization will cause more morons to become neutrons, forming isodopes. \r\n\r\nThis characteristic of moron promotion leads some scientists to believe that Gv is formed whenever morons reach a certain quantity in concentration. This hypothetical quantity is referred to as Critical Morass. \r\n\r\nWhen catalyzed with money, Gv becomes Administratium (Am) - an element which radiates just as much energy as Gv since it has half as many peons but twice as many morons.",

Because of the delicate nature of this procedure, replacement of mouse balls should only be attempted by properly trained personnel.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining the underside of the mouse. Domestic balls will be larger and harder than foreign balls. Ball removal procedures differ depending upon the manufacturer of the mouse. Foreign balls can be replaced using the pop-off method. Domestic balls are replaced by the twist-off method. Mouse balls are not usually static sensitive. However, excessive handling can result in sudden discharge.\r\n\r\nUpon completion of ball replacement, the mouse can be used immediately.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that each replacer have a pair of spare balls for maintaining optimum customer satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAny customer missing his balls should suspect local personnel of removing these necessary items.",

However, it wasn't until he was in his house when he realized it had a collar. It said \"Fluffy,\" nothing else. No phone number, no street address, nothing. He went around the neighborhood, asking if anyone had lost a cat, to which he always got the same reply: \"No.\" Then, one day the cat got stuck in a tree that was too tall for him to climb. He tried everything: coaxing it with warm milk, scaring it down, even calling the fire department, but nothing worked. Suddenly, while he was reading the newspaper, he got an idea. He tied a rope to the front of his pick-up truck, and then tied it to the branch the cat was on. He backed up the truck, thinking, \"If it gets low enough, I can just grab it.\"  He backs up onto the end of his driveway, then gets out of the car to get the cat. But the knot in the tree came undone, and the tree flung the cat over his back yard and into the sky, like a slingshot.  The pastor felt very sad, and kept up his search for the cat's owner. Then, one day in the supermarket, he sees a woman from his neighborhood with bags of cat food in her cart. Knowing that she hated cats, he asked her why she was buying cat food She told him this:\r\n\"For a while now my daughter has been begging me for a cat. So last week, when she asked me yet again, I said 'If you want one that badly, then ask God for one!' The next day, I saw her go into the backyard and start praying on an old mattress I had in the backyard. And then the darndest thing happened, I swear this is true, when she got done praying a cat fell out of the sky and into the mattress!\"",

Therefore it is important to refresh your memory on the etiquette of this sublime outdoor cooking, as it's the only type of cooking a real man will do, probably because there is some of danger involved. \r\n\r\nWhen a man volunteers to do the BBQ, the following chain of events are put into motion: \r\n\r\n1) The woman buys the food. \r\n2) The woman makes the salad, prepares the vegetables, and makes dessert.\r\n3) The woman prepares the meat for cooking, places it on a tray along with the necessary cooking utensils and sauces, and takes it to the man who is lounging beside the grill - beer in hand. \r\n\r\nHere comes the important part: \r\n\r\n4) THE MAN PLACES THE MEAT ON THE GRILL. \r\n\r\n5) The woman goes inside to organize the plates and cutlery.\r\n6) The woman comes out to tell the man that the meat is burning. He thanks her and asks if she will bring another beer while he deals with the situation. \r\n\r\nImportant again: \r\n\r\n7) THE MAN TAKES THE MEAT OFF THE GRILL AND HANDS IT TO THE WOMAN. \r\n\r\n8) The woman prepares the plates, salad, bread, utensils, napkins, sauces and brings them to the table.\r\n9) After eating, the woman clears the table and does the dishes. \r\n\r\nAnd most important of all: \r\n\r\n10) Everyone PRAISES the MAN and THANKS HIM for his cooking efforts. \r\n\r\n11) The man asks the woman how she enjoyed \"her night off.\" And, seeing her annoyed reaction, concludes that there's just no pleasing some women.",

Most of these deaths are caused by accidental inhalation of DHMO, but the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide do not end there. Prolonged exposure to its solid form causes severe tissue damage. Symptoms of DHMO ingestion can include excessive sweating and urination, and possibly a bloated feeling, nausea, vomiting and body electrolyte imbalance. For those who have become dependent, DHMO withdrawal means death. \r\n\r\nDihydrogen monoxide: \r\n\r\n* is also known as hydric acid, and is the major component of acid rain. \r\n\r\n* contributes to the \"greenhouse effect.\" \r\n\r\n* may cause severe burns. \r\n\r\n* contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape. \r\n\r\n* accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals. \r\n\r\n* may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes. \r\n\r\n* has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients. \r\n\r\nCONTAMINATION IS REACHING EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS! \r\n\r\nQuantities of dihydrogen monoxide have been found in almost every stream, lake, and reservoir in America today. But the pollution is global, and the contaminant has even been found in Antarctic ice. In the midwest alone DHMO has caused millions of dollars of property damage. \r\n\r\nDespite the danger, dihydrogen monoxide is often used: \r\n\r\n* as an industrial solvent and coolant. \r\n\r\n* in nuclear power plants. \r\n\r\n* in the production of styrofoam. \r\n\r\n* as a fire retardant. \r\n\r\n* in many forms of cruel animal research. \r\n\r\n* in the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical. \r\n\r\n* as an additive in \"junk-foods\" and other food products. \r\n\r\nCompanies dump waste DHMO into rivers and the ocean, and nothing can be done to stop them because this practice is still legal. The impact on wildlife is extreme, and we cannot afford to ignore it any longer! \r\n\r\nTHE HORROR MUST BE STOPPED! \r\n\r\nThe American government has refused to ban the production, distribution, or use of this damaging chemical due to its \"importance to the economic health of this nation.\" In fact, the navy and other military organizations are conducting experiments with DHMO, and designing multi-billion dollar devices to control and utilize it during warfare situations. Hundreds of military research facilities receive tons of it through a highly sophisticated underground distribution network. Many store large quantities for later use. \r\n\r\nIT'S NOT TOO LATE! \r\n\r\nAct NOW to prevent further contamination. Find out more about this dangerous chemical. What you don't know CAN hurt you and others throughout the world. \r\n\r\n(Note: Dihydrogen monoxide is another way of saying H2O, or just plain water)",

Researchers claim that these holidays have been missed in the past due to their rather specialized natures and a non-religious orientation. \r\nAdding to the confusion is the fact that the holidays seem, in many respects, to be fairly young in age and so not quite settled properly into calendar slots as are such older and more staid holidays as Christmas, New Years, Thanksgiving, Easter, Purim, Hannukah, and so forth. Indeed these two new holidays not only float around within the calendar from year to year on every currently known calendar system, but they are even known to shift position depending on where in the world you are celebrating them. For example, in the USA they might be celebrated in June while in Argentina they get celebrated in January. Sometimes, they even shift dates between adjacent houses; your family celebrating them on the 14th and 15th while your neighbors celebrate it on the 20th and 21st (or even in different months).\r\n\r\nResearchers at the Institute claim that they made this exciting discovery of the new holidays purely by accident. Rather than looking for new holidays, they were continuing the Institute's famous study on the effects of home buying on the behaviour patterns of hackers. Indeed, this new finding is by the same group that discovered the \"Attic Fan\" effect of home buying on hackers. The \"Attic Fan\" effect is named after a particular incident in the study where researchers discovered a previously asocial hacker standing out at the back yard fence talking to the neighbors about the attic fan he had just finished installing. This was an important breakthrough in their investigation, from that point on they were able to identify more and more cases where previously asocial or hackersocial hackers were spending time talking to non-hackers about typical suburban interests such as home repairs, what the kids have been up to, the lawn, and the weather. (See story \"The Attic Fan Effect\" in our early November issue).\r\n\r\nPagan authorities that we have consulted feel that these new holidays, * All Repairs Day * and * Repaireen *, may in fact be manifestations of the birth of a new deity (tentatively named either Fickzt or D'whityors'lv) or the resurrection/re-incarnation of a deity previously believed permanently dissolved (called variously J'k'falltrds and Houmcr'ftzm'n).\r\n\r\nAlthough divided on the cause, age, and significance of these newly discovered holidays all the experts we talked to (the pagans, the researchers at the Institute, and outside researchers) agree that these newly discovered, seemingly non-secular holidays are fairly straightforward in nature. All Repairs Day is a day of celebration of all that is holy in home repairs; All Repairs Day is when the home craftsperson celebrates with his or her house (or any possession repaired during the previous year, but most frequently the house) work well done during the past year. Repaireen, the night before All Repairs Day, is when the barrier between the current status of an object and the previous status of the object is at its weakest; since most objects don't have enough personality to exert themselves, the objects that act up are usually unhappy houses.\r\n\r\nThe Institute report claims that on Repaireen your house is most likely to express its displeasure with some modification or repair made in the past, usually a poorly or sloppily done job. Sometimes though, it will object simply because it feels it has been disfigured. For instance, if you took a porch or sundeck off of the house, it might feel that its lines had been damaged or that its features were now disfigured. Probably the greatest danger of this night is that an older cranky house might take out on you its displeasure with changes made by a previous owner. Especially if the previous owner has moved on without leaving a forwarding address (such as when they die or move to New Jersey). It is believed that many so-called \"haunted\" houses are merely houses voicing their legitimate Repaireen complaints, but, because Repaireen (with all of its ramifications) was an unrecognized holiday before, no one understood what the poor houses were trying to say.\r\n\r\nResearchers at the Institute made their discovery through discussions with hackers who had bought houses in the past few years. Often these hackers had moved from rented house to rented house before finally buying a house for themselves. When asked to describe what caused them to finally buy a house of their own, these hackers often claimed that they felt uneasy in the rented houses, that something felt wrong or out of place and they weren't able to fix it. A feeling much like they got when using poorly designed software that they didn't have source code for; some claimed that once, sometimes twice, a year they could literally feel their rented houses calling out for something. Many claimed that it frustrated their debugging instincts that they couldn't fix the \"bugs\" they could \"hear\" in the house at such times. For several months, the researchers mistook this sensitivity to the houses for the commonly found urge to customize software to personal requirements. Only after more and more hackers began to explain about \"feeling the house calling out for something one night\" did they realize that they were seeing an entirely different phenomenon.\r\n\r\nA spokesman for the Institute claims that although this finding of the new holidays is very exciting, it simply isn't covered by the grant which funds the researchers who discovered the holidays. As a result, the group has had to postpone further research on the holidays until the study on the effects of home buying on hackers has been completed. The companies underwriting the home buying study are quite adamant about having the study completed; they are anxious to find out what kinds of changes they can expect to see in their hackers as the hackers grow older. However, at the Institute's request they have increased funding for the study to allow an expansion to cover hardware hackers as well as software hackers. The Institute spokesman also indicated that the Institute is now seeking funding for two more studies, one to follow up on this discovery of the holidays and another one to re-evaluate some earlier findings about the sensitivity of hackers and also about their need to customize software and hardware. These re-evaluations will be designed to cover both hardware and software hackers.",

        "body": "Automobile Tool Definitions\r\nHammer: \r\nOriginally employed as a weapon of war, the hammer nowadays is used as a kind of divining rod to locate expensive car parts not far from the object we are trying to hit. \r\n\r\nMechanic's Knife: \r\nUsed to open and slice through the contents of cardboard cartons delivered to your front door; works particularly well on boxes containing convertible tops or tonneau covers. \r\n\r\nElectric Hand Drill: \r\nNormally used for spinning steel Pop rivets in their holes until you die of old age, but it also works great for drilling rollbar mounting holes in the floor of a sports car just above the brake line that goes to the rear axle. \r\n\r\nHacksaw: \r\nOne of a family of cutting tools built on the Ouija board principle. It transforms human energy into a crooked, unpredictable motion, and the more you attempt to influence its course, the more dismal your future becomes. \r\n\r\nVise-Grips: \r\nUsed to round off bolt heads. If nothing else is available, they can also be used to transfer intense welding heat to the palm of your hand. \r\n\r\nOxyacetelene Torch: \r\nUsed almost entirely for lighting those stale garage cigarettes you keep hidden in the back of the Whitworth socket drawer (What wife would think to look in _there_?) because you can never remember to buy lighter fluid for the Zippo lighter you got from the PX at Fort Campbell. \r\n\r\nZippo Lighter: \r\nSee oxyacetelene torch. \r\n\r\nWhitworth Sockets: \r\nOnce used for working on older British cars and motorcycles, they are now used mainly for hiding six-month old Salems from the sort of person who would throw them away for no good reason. \r\n\r\nDrill Press: \r\nA tall upright machine useful for suddenly snatching flat metal bar stock out of your hands so that it smacks you in the chest and flings your beer across the room, splattering it against the Rolling Stones poster over the bench grinder. \r\n\r\nWire Wheel: \r\nCleans rust off old bolts and then throws them somewhere under the workbench with the speed of light. Also removes fingerprint whorls and hard-earned guitar callouses in about the time it takes you to say, \"Django Reinhardt\". \r\n\r\nHydraulic Floor Jack: \r\nUsed for lowering a Mustang to the ground after you have installed a set of Ford Motorsports lowered road springs, trappng the jack handle firmly under the front air dam. \r\n\r\nEight-Foot Long Douglas Fir 2X4: \r\nUsed for levering a car upward off a hydraulic jack. \r\n\r\nTweezers: \r\nA tool for removing wood splinters. \r\n\r\nPhone: \r\nTool for calling your neighbor Chris to see if he has another hydraulic floor jack. \r\n\r\nSnap-On Gasket Scraper: \r\nTheoretically useful as a sandwich tool for spreading mayonnaise; used mainly for getting dog-doo off your boot. \r\n\r\nE-Z Out Bolt and Stud Extractor: \r\nA tool that snaps off in bolt holes and is ten times harder than any known drill bit. \r\n\r\nTiming Light: \r\nA stroboscopic instrument for illuminating grease buildup on crankshaft pulleys. \r\n\r\nTwo-Ton Hydraulic Engine Hoist: \r\nA handy tool for testing the tensile strength of ground straps and hydraulic clutch lines you may have forgotten to disconnect. \r\n\r\nCraftsman 1/2 x 16-inch Screwdriver: \r\nA large motor mount prying tool that inexplicably has an accurately machined screwdriver tip on the end without the handle. \r\n\r\nBattery Electrolyte Tester: \r\nA handy tool for transferring sulfuric acid from car battery to the inside of your toolbox after determining that your battery is dead as a doornail, just as you thought. \r\n\r\nAviation Metal Snips: \r\nSee Hacksaw. \r\n\r\nTrouble Light: \r\nThe mechanic's own tanning booth. Sometimes called a drop light, it is a good source of vitamin D, \"the sunshine vitamin\", which is not otherwise found under cars at night. Health benefits aside, its main purpose is to consume 40-watt light bulbs at about the same rate that 105-mm howitzer shells might be used during, say, the first few hours of the Battle of the Bulge. More often dark than light, its name is somewhat misleading. \r\n\r\nPhillips Screwdriver: \r\nNormally used to stab the lids of old-style paper-and-tin oil cans and splash oil on your shirt; can also be used, as the name implies, to round off Phillips screw heads. \r\n\r\nAir Compressor: \r\nA machine that takes energy produced in a coal-burning power plant 200 miles away and transforms it into compressed air that travels by hose to a Chicago Pneumatic impact wrench that grips rusty suspension bolts last tightened 40 years ago by someone in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, and rounds them off.",

        "body": "A Cautionary Tale\r\n\r\nIt started out innocently enough. I began to think at parties now and then - just to loosen up. Inevitably, though, one thought led to another, and soon I was more than just a social thinker.\r\n\r\nI began to think alone - \"to relax,\" I told myself - but I knew it wasn't true. Thinking became more and more important to me, and finally I was thinking all the time.\r\n\r\nThat was when things began to sour at home. One evening I turned off the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life. She spent that night at her mother's. I began to think on the job. I knew that thinking and employment don't mix, but I couldn't help myself.\r\n\r\nI began to avoid friends at lunchtime so I could read Hayek, Hazlett and Socrates. I would return to the office dizzied and confused, asking, \"What is it exactly we are doing here?\"\r\n\r\nOne day the boss called me in. He said, \"Listen, I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but your thinking has become a real problem. If you don't stop thinking on the job, you'll have to find another job.\"\r\n\r\nThis gave me a lot to think about. I came home early after my conversation with the boss. \"Honey,\" I confess, \"I've been thinking...\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you've been thinking,\" she said, \"and I want a divorce!\"\r\n\r\n\"But Honey, surely it's not that serious.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is serious,\" she said, lower lip aquiver. \"You think as much as college professors and college professors don't make any money, so if you keep on thinking, we won't have any money!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a faulty syllogism,\" I said impatiently.\r\n\r\nShe exploded in tears of rage and frustration, but I was in no mood to deal with the emotional drama.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to the library,\" I snarled as I stomped out the door.\r\n\r\nI headed for the library, in the mood for some von Mises.  I roared into the parking lot with jazz on the radio and ran up to the big glass doors. They didn't open. The library was closed.\r\n\r\nTo this day, I believe that a Higher Power was looking out for me that night. Leaning on the unfeeling glass, whimpering for Ayn Rand and Nathaniel Branden, a poster caught my eye, \"Friend, is heavy thinking ruining your life?\" it asked.\r\n\r\nYou probably recognize that line. It comes from the standard Thinkers Anonymous poster.\r\n\r\nThis is why I am what I am today: a recovering thinker. I never miss a TA meeting. At each meeting we watch a non-educational video; last week it was \"Porky's\". Then we share experiences about how we avoided thinking since the last meeting.\r\n\r\nI still have my job, and things are a lot better at home. Life just seemed...easier, somehow, as soon as I stopped thinking. I think the road to recovery is nearly complete for me.\r\n\r\nToday I took the final step............ I am running for Congress.",

Check this out.\" - and he shows him a time zone display not just for every time zone in the world, but for the 86 largest metropoli. He hits a few buttons and from somewhere on the watch a voice says \"The time is eleven 'til six\" in a very West Texas accent. A few more buttons and the same voice says something in Japanese. Jake continues \"I've put in regional accents for each city.\" The display is unbelievably high quality and the voice is simply astounding. The stranger is struck dumb with admiration. \r\n\r\n\"That's not all,\" says Jake. He pushes a few more buttons and a tiny but very hi-resolution map of New York City appears on the display. \"The flashing dot shows our location by satellite positioning,\" explains Jake. \"View recede ten,\" Jake says, and the display changes to show eastern New York state. \r\n\r\n\"I want to buy this watch!\" says the stranger. \r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, it's not ready for sale yet. I'm still working out the bugs.\" says the inventor. \"Look at this,\" and he proceeds to demonstrate that the watch is also a very creditable little FM radio receiver with a digital tuner, a sonar device that can measure distances up to 125 meters, a pager with thermal paper printout and, most impressive of all, the capacity for voice recordings of up to 300 standard-size books, \"though I only have 32 of my favorites in there so far.\" finishes Jake. \r\n\r\n\"I've got to have this watch!\" says the stranger. \r\n\r\n\"No, you don't understand - it's not ready.\" \r\n\r\n\"I'll give you $1000 for it!\" \r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, I've already spent more than -\" \r\n\r\n\"I'll give you $5000 for it!\" \r\n\r\n\"But it's just not -\" \r\n\r\n\"I'll give you $15,000 for it!\" And the stranger pulls out a checkbook. \r\n\r\nJake stops to think. He's only put about $8500 into materials and development, and with $15,000 he can make another one and have it ready for merchandising in only six months. \r\n\r\nThe stranger frantically finishes writing the check and waves it in front of him. \"Here it is, ready to hand to you right here and now. $15,000. Take it or leave it.\" \r\n\r\nJake abruptly makes his decision. \"OK,\" he says, and peels off the watch. They make the exchange and the stranger starts happily away. \r\n\r\n\"Hey, wait a minute,\" calls Jake after the stranger, who turns around warily. \r\n\r\nJake points to the two suitcases he'd been trying to wrestle through the bus station. \r\n\r\n\"Don't forget your batteries.\"",

It will save you a lot of grief in the long run. However, it will probably take several rounds to kill them, so be prepared. This also applies to kids who speak with somebody else's voice. \r\n\r\n- When you have the benefit of numbers, NEVER split up and go it alone. \r\n\r\n- Don't have sex. Especially if you've noticed a few of your friends are missing! \r\n\r\n- As a general rule, don't solve puzzles that open a portal to Hell.\r\n\r\n-Never stand in, on, or above a grave, tomb, or crypt. This would apply to any other house of the dead as well. \r\n\r\n- If you're searching for something which caused a loud noise and find out that it's just the cat, don't stand their sighing with relief, GET THE HECK OUT! \r\n\r\n- If appliances start operating by themselves, don't check for short circuits; JUST GET OUT! \r\n\r\n- Do not take ANYTHING from the dead. \r\n\r\n- If you find a town which looks deserted, there's probably a good reason for it. Don't stop and look around. \r\n\r\n- Don't fool with recombinant DNA technology unless you're sure you know what you're doing. \r\n\r\n- If you're running from the monster, expect to trip or fall down at least twice, more if you are of the female persuasion. Also note that, despite the fact that you are running and the monster is merely ambling along, it's still moving fast enough to catch up with you.\r\n\r\n- If your companions suddenly begin to exhibit uncharacteristic behavior such as hissing, fascination for blood, glowing eyes, increasing hairiness, and so on, kill them immediately. \r\n\r\n- Stay away from certain geographical locations, some of which are listed here: Amityville, Elm Street, Transylvania, Arkham (you're in trouble if you recognize this one), the Bermuda Triangle, or any small town in Maine. \r\n\r\n- If your car runs out of gas at night on a lonely road, do not go to the nearby deserted-looking house to phone for help. If you think that it is strange because you thought you had 3/4 of a tank, shoot yourself instead. You are going to die anyway, and will most likely be eaten. \r\n\r\n- Beware of strangers bearing strange tools. For example: chainsaws, staple guns, hedge trimmers, electric carving knives, combines, lawnmowers, butane torches, soldering irons, band saws, or any devices made from deceased companions. \r\n\r\n- If you find that your house is built upon a cemetery, now is the time to move in with the in-laws. This also applies to houses that had previous inhabitants who went mad or committed suicide or died in some horrible fashion, or had inhabitants who performed satanic practices in your house.",

Providing you do that, you'll be fine.\"\r\n\r\nThe jockey thinks the trainer is mad but promises to shout the command. The race begins and they approach the first hurdle. The jockey ignores the trainer's ridiculous advice and the horse crashes straight through the center of the jump.\r\n\r\nThey carry on and approach the second hurdle. The jockey, somewhat embarrassed, whispers 'Aleeee ooop' in the horse's ear. The same thing happens - the horse crashes straight through the center of the jump.\r\n\r\nAt the third hurdle, the jockey thinks, \"It's no good, I'll have to do it,\" and yells, \"ALLLEEE OOOP!\" really loudly. Sure enough, the horse sails over the jump with no problems. This continues for the rest of the race, but due to the earlier problems the horse only finishes third.\r\n\r\nThe trainer is fuming and asks the jockey what went wrong. The jockey replies, \"Nothing is wrong with me - it's this bloody horse. What is he - deaf or something?\" \r\n\r\nThe trainer replies, \"Deaf? DEAF? He's not deaf - he's BLIND!\"",

They were told by the angel that there was room for only one of them in Heaven. Their fate would be determined by the way each of them had died, so the angel went to each man and asked how they had died.\r\n\r\nThe first guy, when approached, said:\r\n\"Well, I live on the 14th floor of my apartment building and I came home early from work because I suspected that my wife had been cheating on me, and I wanted to give the other man a piece of my mind. However, when I got home there was no one in the apartment aside from my wife, but my intuition told me otherwise, so I searched the apartment. When I came to my balcony, ready the commit suicide, I saw a man hanging on, at that point I was so angry at him that I stepped on his hands hoping he'd fall off, but he remained firm. So I went back inside and got a hammer and hit his hands, but he still didn't fall off. In my frustration I went in the kitchen and got the refrigerator, flinging myself, the refrigerator, and him down 14 floors. And that is how I died.\"\r\n\r\nThe second guy said:\r\n\"I am a window washer and was cleaning the windows on the 17 story when my cart broke and I began falling. Luckily I was able to grab onto the 14th story balcony, when this guy comes. I was so relieved thinking I'd be rescued, when instead, he starts stepping on my hands, but I refused to fall and die so I put all my energy into staying on. Then the guy goes back inside and comes back with a hammer and starts hitting my hands again, but I refused to let go. Finally the guy goes back inside and flings himself and refrigerator on me. And that is how I died.\"\r\n\r\nThe third guy said:\r\n\"Well, I was in this lady's aparment and we were making out on the couch, and things were heating up until her husband comes home early. I quickly hid in the refrigerator, and that's all I remember.\"\r\n\r\nWho do you think went to Heaven?",

Caught by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged, 1889.\"\r\n\r\nPretty grim situation, right? But let's revise things a bit. We simply crop the picture, scan in an enlarged image and edit it with image processing software so that all that is seen is a head shot.\r\n\r\nNext, we rewrite the text:\r\n\r\n\"Remus Starr was a famous cowboy in the Montana Territory. His business empire grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets and intimate dealings with the Montana railroad.\r\n\r\n\"Beginning in 1885, he devoted several years of his life to service at a government facility, finally taking leave to resume his dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective Agency. In 1889, Remus passed away during an important civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which he was standing collapsed.\"",

Germany was on one side of France and Russia was on the other. At war people get killed, and then they aren't people any more, but friends. Peace was proclaimed at Versigh, which was attended by George Loid, Primal Minister of England. President Wilson arrived with 14 pointers. In 1937 Lenin revolted Russia. Communism raged among the peasants, and the civil war 'team colours' were red and white.\r\n\r\nGermany was displaced after WWI. This gave rise to Hitler. Germany was morbidly over-excited and unbalanced. Berlin became the decadent capital, where all forms of sexual deprivations were practised. A huge anti-semantic movement arose. Attractive slogans like \"death to all Jews\" were used by government groups. Hitler remilitarized the Rhineland over a squirmish between Germany and France.\r\n\r\nThe appeasers were blinded by the great red of the Soviets. Moosealini rested his foundations on 8 million bayonets and invaded Hi Lee Salasy. Germany invaded Poland, France invaded Belgium, and Russia invaded everybody. War screeched to an end when a nukuleer explosion was dropped on Heroshima. A whole generation had been wipe out in two world wars, and their forlorne families were left to pick up the peaces.\r\n\r\nAccording to Fromm, individuation began historically in medieval times. This was a period of small childhood. There is increasing experience as adolescence experiences its life development. The last stage is us.\r\nA new time zone of national unification roared over the horizon. Founder of the new Italy was Cavour, an intelligent Sardine from the north. Nationalism aided Itally because nationalism is the growth of an army. We can see that nationalism succeeded for Itally because of France's big army. Napoleam III-IV mounted the French thrown. One thinks of Napoleon III as a live extension of the late but great, Napoleon. Here too was the new Germany: loud, bold, vulgar and full of reality.\r\n\r\nCulture fomented from Europe's tip to its top. Richard Strauss, who was violent but methodical like his wife made him, plunged into vicious and perverse plays. Dramatized were adventures in seduction and abortion. Music reeked with reality. Wagner was master of music, and people did not forget his contribution. When he died they labeled his seat \"historical\". Other countries had their own artists. France had Chekhov.",

If the Spanish could gain the Netherlands they would have a stronghold throughout northern Europe which would include their posetions in Italy, Burgundy, central Europe and India thus serrounding France. The German Emperor's lower passage was blocked by the French for years and years.\r\n\r\nLouise XIV became King of the Sun. He gave the people food and artillery. If he didn't like someone, he sent them to the gallows to row for the rest of their lives. Vauban was the royal minister of flirtation. In Russia the 17th century was known as the time of the bounding of the serfs. Russian nobles wore clothes only to humour Peter the Great. Peter filled his goverment with accidental people and built a new capital near the European boarder. Orthodox priests became government antennae.\r\n\r\nThe enlightenment was a reasonable time. Voltare wrote a book called Candy that got him into trouble with Frederick the Great. Philosophers were unknown as yet, and the fundamental stake was one of religious toleration slightly confused with defeatism. France was in a serious state. Taxation was a great drain on the state budget. The French revolution was accomplished before it happened. The revolution evolved through republican and tolarian phases until it catapulted into Napolean. Napoleon was ill with bladder problems and was very tense and unrestrained.\r\n\r\nHistory, a record of things left behind by past generations, started in 1815. Throughout the comparatively radical years 1815-1870 the western European continent was undergoing a Rampant period of economic modification. Industrialisation was precipitating in England.\r\n\r\nProblems were so complexicated that in Paris, out of a city population of 1 million people, 2 million able bodies were on the loose.\r\n\r\nGreat Brittian, the USA and other European countries had demicratic leanings. The middle class was tired and needed a rest. The old order could see the lid holding down new ideas beginning to shake. Among the goals of the chartists were universal suferage and anal parliment.

Church and state were cooperatic. Middle Evil society was made up of monks, lords and surfs. It is unfortunate that we do not have a medivel European laid out on a table before us, ready for dissection.\r\n\r\nAfter a revival of infantile commerce slowly creeoed into Europe, merchants appeared. Some were sitters and some were drifters. They roamed from town to town exposing themselves and organized big fairies in the countryside.\r\n\r\nMideval people were violent. Murder during this Period was nothing. Everybody killed someone. England fought numerously for land in France and ended up wining and losing. The Crusades were a series of military expaditions made by Christians seeking to free the holy land (the \"Home Town\" of Christ) from the Islams.\r\n\r\nIn the 1400 hundreds most Englishmen were perpendicular. A class of yeowls arose. Finally Europe caught the Black Death. The bubonic plague is a social disease in the sense that it can be transmitted by intercourse and other etceteras. It was spread from port to port by infected rats. Victims of the Black Death grew boobs on their necks. The plague also helped the emergance of the English language as the national language of England, France and Italy.\r\n\r\nThe Middle Ages slimpared to a halt. The renasence bolted in from the blue. Life reeked with joy. Italy became robust, and more individuals felt the value of their human being. Italy, of course, was much closer to the rest of the world thanks to Northern Europe. Man was determined to civilise himself and his brothers, even if heads had to roll! It became sheik to be educated. Art was on a more associated level. Europe was full of incredable churches with great art bulging out of their doors. Renaissance merchants were beautiful and almost lifelike.\r\n\r\nThe Reformnation happened when German nobles resented the idea that tithes were going to Papal France or the Pope, thus enriching Catholic coiffures. Traditions had become oppressive so they too were crushed in the wake of man's quest for ressurection above the not-just-social beast he had become. An angry Martin Luther nailed 95 theocrats to a church door. Theologically, Luthar was into reorientation mutation. Calvinism was the most convenient religion since the days of the ancients. Anabaptist services tended to be migratory. The Popes, of course, were usually Catholic. Monks went right on seeing themselves as worms. The last Jesuit priest died in the 19th century.",

He tied the other end to the bike and told the man that if he got to going too fast, to honk the horn on his bike and that he would slow down.\r\n\r\nEverything went fine for the first 30 miles. Suddenly, another Corvette blew past them. Forgetting completely about the cyclist he's towing, the Corvette pulling the bike immediately took off after the other. A short distance down the road, the Corvettes, both going well over 90 mph, blew through a speed trap. The police officer noted the speeds from his radar gun and radioed to the other officer that he had 2 Corvettes headed his way at over 90 mph.

Since she had the same phone number for years, she felt that she had a case to persuade the motel management to change its number. \r\n\r\nNaturally, the management refused claiming that it could not change its stationery. \r\n\r\nThe phone company was not helpful, either. A number was a number, and just because a customer was getting someone else's calls 24 hours a day didn't make it responsible. After her pleas fell on deaf ears, Leola decided to take matters into her own hands. \r\n\r\nAt 9 o'clock the phone rang. Someone from Memphis was calling the motel and asked for a room for the following Tuesday. Leola said, \"No problem. How many nights?\" \r\n\r\nA few hours later Dallas checked in. A secretary wanted a suite with two bedrooms for a week. Emboldened, Leola said the Presidential Suite on the 10th floor was available for $600 a night. The secretary said that she would take it and asked if the hotel wanted a deposit. \"No, that won't be necessary,\" Leola said. \"We trust you.\" \r\n\r\nThe next day was a busy one for Leola. In the morning, she booked an electric appliance manufacturers' convention for Memorial Day weekend, a college prom and a reunion of the 82nd Airborne veterans from World War II. \r\n\r\nShe turned on her answering machine during lunchtime so that she could watch her favorite soap opera, but her biggest challenge came in the afternoon when a mother called to book the ballroom for her daughter's wedding in June. \r\n\r\nLeola assured the woman that it would be no problem and asked if she would be providing the flowers or did she want the hotel to take care of it. The mother said that she would prefer the hotel to handle the floral arrangements. Then the question of valet parking came up. Once again Leola was helpful. \"There's no charge for valet parking, but we always recommend that the client tips the drivers.\" \r\n\r\nWithin a few months, the Ribrock Plaza Motel was a disaster area. \r\n\r\nPeople kept showing up for weddings, bar mitzvahs, and Sweet Sixteen parties and were all told there were no such events. \r\n\r\nLeola had her final revenge when she read in the local paper that the motel might go bankrupt. Her phone rang, and an executive from Marriott said, \"We're prepared to offer you $200,000 for the motel.\" \r\n\r\nLeola replied, \"We'll take it, but only if you change the telephone number.\"",

They only cooed and condescended about what a good little cat I was...Hmmm. Not working according to plan...\r\n\r\nDAY 768 - I am finally aware of how sadistic they are.

In her statement she described how she came up to the intersection leading into her downtown condo, and rear ended the driver in front of her due to his 'complete and full stop'. She continues to say that of the almost 2 years of living in that particular condominium complex, she had not once been behind someone who had made a full stop at the stop sign, and that his inability to be 'consistent with typical driving patterns' caused the accident. As a result, she is convinced that Mr. Thompson is directly responsible for the accident and should be held accountable for all incurred costs of repair to both vehicles. When reminded that it is the law to make a complete stop at a stop sign, her abrupt response was \"I am quite capable of deciding when it is a good or bad time to stop my vehicle.\"\r\n\r\nOwner of Perfect House Lives in Car\r\nSeptember 18, 2002 - Baltimore, USA\r\n\r\nIn fear of possibly disturbing the perfection that is his house, Donald Manison has been forced to live in his 1998 Dodge Caravan. \"I became obsessive, everything in the house was so photo-perfect that I was eventually scared of walking on the carpet in fear that I might disturb the direction of the carpet threads.\" Magazines wanting a glimpse and photos of the perfect house were limited to viewing through opened ground floor windows. When asked how long he will continue his present lifestyle he replied, \"If living in my mini-van is payment for a perfect house, I'm willing to pay.\"\r\n\r\nLack of Talent Contest Being Held for Next Batch of Mac Commercials\r\nJuly 22, 2002 - New York, USA\r\n\r\nApple's new \"Switch\" television ad campaign, featuring people who didn't quite know what to do with a Windows based PC that moved to that Mac platform, will continue into the summer season. In order to find actors similarly dense and ignorant to the ones featured in the first batch of commercials, Apple will be holding a Lack of Talent contest. Campaign producer Ted Zielchman commented, \"All of the actors we were getting from the talent agencies were too intelligent, and these are people who are usually rejected based on lack of intelligence, so we are faced with a unique problem. I believe though, based on the applicants for the contest so far, we have some likely candidates. Some were unable to even spell their name and had that 'not so bright look on their face' - consistent with the first batch of actors we used. The first batch were easy to find, we visited the local district Mac Club. After that we simply had a hard time finding anyone willing to admit being an Apple user.\"",

        "body": "1. Eat nothing but gas-inducing foods the entire trip, not hesitating to 'share the wealth' with everyone on board. Recommended foods are chilli, burritos, McDonalds, any eggs, Kentuky Fried Chicken (stay near the toilet if you want the KFC).\r\n\r\n2. Repeat #1, only engage in a 'cuppy war' with the bus driver. (For those that do not know what a 'cuppy' is, it involves making a cup with your hand, farting in it and slipping it directly into the face of some unsuspecting friend.)\r\n\r\n3. Every time the bus wobbles from the wind caused by passing transports, jump up and scream \"WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!\"\r\n\r\n4. Incessantly complain that it is way too cold in the bus, no matter what the temperature is, keep doing it until the bus driver turns the heat up to full blast just to shut you up, then wait a few minutes for it to get really hot and start to complain about it.\r\n\r\n5. Two words: Water Pistol\r\n\r\n6. Two more words: Paper Airplanes\r\n\r\n7. Make racing car noises constantly, occasionally announcing your progress along the 'racetrack' in an announcer voice. When anyone comes up to you and asks what the fuck you are doing, look at them funny and ask how they got in your NASCAR.\r\n\r\n8. Eat nothing but really noisy foods, such as bags of chips, nachos, tacos, individually wrapped candies and unwrap them as loudly as possible. Also eat them noisily, chewing with your mouth open and making the loudest possible slopping noises.\r\n\r\n9. Purchase a megaphone, 'nuff said.\r\n\r\n10. Engage in some hot, wild sex at the back of the bus with one or more passengers.\r\n\r\n11. Sit at the back of the bus, turning off all the lights around you and keeping the blinds down, keep a black briefcase on your lap at all times, wear a black trench coat and a black hat, look really nervous, don't talk to anybody and keep glancing at your watch.\r\n\r\n12. Walk up and down the aisle, claiming out loud that you are Jesus and blessing everyone with a half-eaten leg of Kentucky Fried Chicken.\r\n\r\n13. When the bus is driving all alone on a long stretch of highway, preferably completely devoid of life of any sort, suddenly jump up and start running up and down the aisle, flailing your arms and screaming as loud and you can.\r\n\r\n14. Then after 30 seconds or so, sit down at your seat and act like nothing happened.\r\n\r\n15. When the bus stops for a food break, instead of following the other passengers to a restaurant, sit outside in front of the big picture window on the ground with a struggling burlap sack. Open the sack and remove some small, live animal (cat, squirrel, rat, pigeon, etc) and eat it like a feral dog would, in the view of everyone else. Make lots of growling noises, snarl and snap at people who get too close.\r\n\r\n16. Use the bathroom often, for disturbingly long periods of time. Make lots of grunting and straining noises, loud enough for everyone to hear. Occasionally drop an orange into the bowl from a good height.\r\n\r\n17. When in the bathroom, wait for the bus to hit a huge pothole or bump, then scream for help, claiming you are now shitting on your head.\r\n\r\n18. Get on the bus first, pick the seat right behind the bus driver, as everyone gets on, greet each one of them with a hug and a kiss.\r\n\r\n19. At night when everyone is sleepy and unsuspecting, suddenly start barking as loud as possible; feel free to use megaphone.\r\n\r\n20. Play with knives, just like Bishop on Aliens!\r\n\r\n21. Clean a .357 Magnum, if that doesn't get people's attention, cleaning the rest of your on-board hand collection will.\r\n\r\n22. When someone is in the toilet, bang on the door and yell at them to get out as quickly as possible. Then just as they open the door, put a strained look on your face and say \"Never mind...\" then drive the point home by farting.\r\n\r\n23. Musical chairs, using your 200 watt boom box.\r\n\r\n24. Come onto the bus with a beanie on, sit down and put your walkman headphone buds up your nose. When the person sitting beside you looks at you like you are from Mars, say, \"Mishap during an operation, Doctors just aren't the same these days.\"\r\n\r\n25. When sitting down in your seat, pull out a small collection of vomit bags, look through them and ask the person beside you, \"If I run out, do you have any paper or plastic bags? I'm not picky, either would be fine.\"",

PHIL:\r\nThe problem we have here is that this chicken won't realize that he must first deal with the problem on \"THIS\" side of the road before it goes after the problem on the \"OTHER SIDE\" of the road. What we need to do is help him realize how stupid he's acting by not taking on his \"CURRENT\" problems before adding \"NEW\" problems.\r\n\r\nOPRAH:\r\nWell, I understand that the chicken is having problems, which is why he wants to cross this road so bad. So instead of having the chicken learn from his mistakes and take falls, which is a part of life, I'm going to give this chicken a car so that he can just drive across the road \r\nand not live his life like the rest of the chickens.\r\n\r\nGEORGE W. BUSH:\r\nWe don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We\r\njust want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road, or not. \r\nThe chicken is either against us, or for us. There is no middle ground here.\r\n\r\nDONALD RUMSFELD:\r\nNow to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image of the chicken crossing the road.\r\n\r\nANDERSON COOPER/CNN:\r\nWe have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road.\r\n\r\nJOHN KERRY:\r\nAlthough I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against it! It was the wrong road to cross, and I was misled about the chicken's intentions. I am for it now, and will remain against it.\r\n\r\nJUDGE JUDY:\r\nThat chicken crossed the road because he's GUILTY! You can see it in his eyes and the way he walks.\r\n\r\nPAT BUCHANAN:\r\nTo steal the job of a decent, hardworking American.\r\n\r\nMARTHA STEWART:\r\nNo one called me to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer's Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level.\r\n\r\nDR SEUSS:\r\nDid the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad?\r\nYes, the chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I've not been told.\r\n\r\nERNEST HEMINGWAY:\r\nTo die in the rain. Alone.\r\n\r\nJERRY FALWELL:\r\nBecause the chicken was gay! Can't you people see the plain truth in front of your face? The chicken was going to the \"other side.\"\r\nThat's why they call it the \"other side. Yes, my friends, that chicken is gay. And if you eat that chicken, you will become gay too. I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out this abomination that the liberal media white washes with seemingly harmless phrases like \"the other side.\" That chicken should not be free to cross the road. It's as plain and simple as that!\r\n\r\nGRANDPA:\r\nIn my day we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road.\r\nSomebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough.\r\n\r\nBARBARA WALTERS:\r\nIsn't that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heart warming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish its life long dream of crossing the road.\r\n\r\nJOHN LENNON:\r\nImagine all the chickens in the world crossing roads together - in peace.\r\n\r\nARISTOTLE:\r\nIt is the nature of chickens to cross the road.\r\n\r\nBILL GATES:\r\nI have just released eChicken2006,which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your check book. Internet explorer is an integral part of chicken.\r\nThe Platform is much more stable and will never cra...#@&&^( C \\..... reboot.\r\n\r\nALBERT EINSTEIN:\r\nDid the chicken really cross the road, or did the road move beneath the chicken?\r\n\r\nBILL CLINTON:\r\nI did not cross the road with THAT chicken. What is your definition of chicken?\r\n\r\nAL GORE:\r\nI invented the chicken!\r\n\r\nCOLONEL SANDERS:\r\nDid I miss one?",

Strange as it seems, the boundary between their turf became a well traveled trail through the jungle. \r\n\r\nAll day, every day, both lions lay in the brush staring across the trail at their compatriot, daring him to cross into their territory. \r\n\r\nThe local natives knew of this animal feud, but all this was unbeknown to African Jack, a well-known and very publicized guide who did not speak Lionese and was unfamiliar with the territory. \r\n\r\nWhile he was leading a safari through the jungle, the travelers had to walk and cut vines with their machetes, and all this constant hacking brush had them worn to a frazzle. After seeing two or three of his safari drop from exhaustion, African Jack decided to stop on the trail between these two lions and camp for the night. \r\n\r\nAfter setting up camp, eating, and getting his safari settled African Jack sat on a stump and began reading. While he was busily engaged in the printed page, the two lions, simultaneously, pounced on African Jack and ate him on the spot. \r\n\r\nWhen the 6 o'clock news heard of the tragedy, they reported, \"African Jack killed this evening. The motive is unclear, but it is reported he was reading between the lions.\"",

Fart, pause momentarily, and comment under your breath, \"I've done better...\"\r\n\r\n30. Fart again later on, take a deep breath and state enthusiastically \"Now that's more like it!\".\r\n\r\n31.

        "body": "If you're going to go down, go down with style. Failing your final exam can actually be an amusing experience, depending on what you make of it. Here are some suggestions... \r\n\r\n1. Bring a pillow. Fall asleep (or pretend to) until the last 15 minutes. Wake up, say, \"Oh geez, better get cracking.\" and do some gibberish work. Turn it in a few minutes early. \r\n\r\n2. Get a copy of the exam, run out screaming \"Andre, Andre, I've got the secret documents!!\" \r\n\r\n3. If it is a math/science exam, answer in essay form. If it is long answer/essay form, answer with numbers and symbols. Be creative. Use the integral symbol. \r\n\r\n4. Make paper airplanes out of the exam. Aim them at the instructor's left nostril. \r\n\r\n5. Talk the entire way through the exam. Read questions aloud, debate your answers with yourself out loud. If asked to stop, yell out, \"I'm SOOO sure you can hear me thinking.\" Then start talking about what a jerk the instructor is. \r\n\r\n6. Bring cheerleaders. \r\n\r\n7. Walk in, get the exam, sit down. About five minutes into it, loudly say to the instructor, \"I don't understand ANY of this. I've been to every lecture all semester long! What's the deal? And who the hell are you? Where's the regular guy?\" \r\n\r\n8. Bring a Game Boy (or Game Gear, etc...). Play with the volume at max level. \r\n\r\n9. On the answer sheet (book, whatever) find a new, interesting way to refuse to answer every question. For example: I refuse to answer this question on the grounds that it conflicts with my religious beliefs. Be creative. \r\n\r\n10. Bring pets. \r\n\r\n11. Run into the exam room looking about frantically. Breathe a sigh of relief. \r\n\r\n12. Go to the instructor, say, \"They've found me, I have to leave the country.\" and run off. \r\n\r\n13. Fifteen minutes into the exam, stand up, rip up all the papers into very small pieces, throw them into the air and yell out \"Merry Christmas.\" If you're really daring, ask for another copy of the exam. Say you lost the first one. \r\n\r\n14. Repeat this process every fifteen minutes. \r\n\r\n15. Do the exam with crayons, paint, or fluorescent markers. \r\n\r\n16. Come into the exam wearing a pair of birkenstocks, and nothing else. \r\n\r\n17. Come down with a BAD case of Tourette's Syndrome during the exam. Be as vulgar as possible. \r\n\r\n18. Do the entire exam in another language. If you don't know one, make one up! For math/science exams, try using Roman numerals. \r\n\r\n19. Bring things to throw at the instructor when s/he's not looking. Blame it on the person nearest to you. \r\n\r\n20. As soon as the instructor hands you the exam, eat it. \r\n\r\n21. Walk into the exam with an entourage. Claim you are going to be taping your next video during the exam. Try to get the instructor to let them stay, be persuasive. Tell the instructor to expect a percentage of the profits if they are allowed to stay. \r\n\r\n22. Every five minutes, stand up, collect all your things, move to another seat, continue with the exam. \r\n\r\n23. Turn in the exam approximately 30 minutes into it. As you walk out, start commenting on how easy it was. \r\n\r\n24. Do the entire exam as if it was multiple choice and true/false. If it is a multiple choice exam, spell out\r\ninteresting things (DCCAB, BABE, etc..). \r\n\r\n25. Bring a black marker. Return the exam with all questions and answers completely blacked out. \r\n\r\n26. Get the exam. Twenty minutes into it, throw your papers down violently, scream out \"Screw this!\" and walk out triumphantly. \r\n\r\n27. Arrange a protest before the exam starts (i.e. Threaten the instructor that whether or not everyone's done, they are all leaving after one hour to go drink). \r\n\r\n28. Show up completely drunk. (Completely drunk means at some point during the exam, you start to hold your mouth and make \"I'm about to bring something up\" sounds.). \r\n\r\n29. Every now and then, clap twice rapidly. If the instructor asks why, tell him/her in a very derogatory tone, \"The light bulb that goes on above my head when I get an idea is hooked up to a clapper. DUH!\" \r\n\r\n30. Comment on how sexy the instructor is looking that day. \r\n\r\n31. Come to the exam wearing a black cloak. After about 30 minutes, put on a white mask and start yelling, \"I'm here, the phantom of the opera!\" until they drag you away. \r\n\r\n32. Go to an exam for a class you have no clue about, where you know the class is very small, and the instructor would recognize you if you belonged. Claim that you have been to every lecture. Fight for your right to take the exam. \r\n\r\n33. Upon receiving the exam, look it over, while laughing loudly, say, \"You don't really expect me to waste my time on this drivel? Days of our Lives is on!!!\" \r\n\r\n34. Bring a water pistol with you. Nuff said. \r\n\r\n35. From the moment the exam begins, hum the theme to Jeopardy. Ignore the instructor's requests for you to stop. When they finally get you to leave one way or another, begin whistling the theme to the Bridge on the River Kwai. \r\n\r\n36. Start a brawl in the middle of the exam. \r\n\r\n37. If the exam is math/science related, make up the longest proofs you could possibly think of. Get pi and imaginary numbers into most equations. \r\n\r\n38. Come in wearing a full knight's outfit, complete with sword and shield. \r\n\r\n39. Bring a friend to give you a back massage the entire way through the exam. Insist this person is needed, because you have bad circulation. \r\n\r\n40. Bring cheat sheets FROM ANOTHER CLASS (make sure this is obvious... like history notes for a calculus exam... otherwise you're not just failing, you're getting kicked out, too) and staple them to the exam with the comment \"Please use the attached notes for references as you see fit.\" \r\n\r\n41. When you walk in, complain about the heat. Strip. \r\n\r\n42. After you get the exam, call the instructor over, point to any question, ask for the answer. Try to work it out of him/her. \r\n\r\n43. One word: Wrestlemania. \r\n\r\n44. Bring balloons, blow them up, start throwing them around like they do before concerts start. \r\n\r\n45. Try to get people in the room to do the wave. \r\n\r\n46. Play Frisbee with a friend at the other side of the room. \r\n\r\n47. Bring some large, cumbersome, ugly idol. Put it right next to you. Pray to it often. Consider a small sacrifice. \r\n\r\n48. Get deliveries of candy, flowers, balloons, telegrams, etc... sent to you every few minutes throughout the exam. \r\n\r\n49. During the exam, take apart everything around you. Desks, chairs, anything you can reach. \r\n\r\n50. Complete the exam with everything you write being backwards at a 90 degree angle. \r\n\r\n51. Bring a musical instrument with you, play various tunes. If you are asked to stop, say \"It helps me think.\" Bring a copy of the Student Handbook with you, challenging the instructor to find the section on musical instruments during finals. Don't forget to use the phrase \"Told you so\". \r\n\r\n52. Answer the exam with the \"Top Ten Reasons Why My Professor Sucks\".",

From their window table they could clearly see the car and bag, and so noticed immediately when a woman walked by the closed bag, looked at it with interest, and went on. In a few minutes she returned, looked a little more closely, glanced around to see if she were being watched, and strolled on. On her third pass, she casually picked up the bag without pausing, and continued on - into the restaurant! She let herself be seated, placed the bag and her purse on the floor next to her chair, and picked up the menu. She ordered, and again casually picked up the Foley's bag to see what wonderful little item she had managed to snag. She opened the bag, looked inside, shuddered, and passed out onto the floor.

How do I go about faxing a complete stranger?\r\nA. Just ask them if they want to fax. If they do, they will give you their phone number.\r\n\r\nQ. My parents say they never had fax when they were young, and were only allowed to write memo's to each other until they were 21. How old do you think someone should be before they can fax?\r\nA. Faxing can be performed at any age once you learn the correct procedure.\r\n\r\nQ. If I fax something to myself will I go blind?\r\nA. Certainly not. As far as we can see.\r\n\r\nQ. There is a place on our street where you can go and pay to fax. Is this legal?\r\nA. Yes, many people have no other outlet for their fax drives and must pay a \"professional\" when their needs become too great.\r\n\r\nQ. Should a cover always be used for faxing?\r\nA. Unless you are really sure of the one you are faxing, a cover should always be used.\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I do the procedure incorrectly and fax prematurely?\r\nA. Don't panic. Many people fax prematurely when they haven't faxed in a long time. Just start over, most people won't mind if you try again.\r\n\r\nQ. I have a personal and a business fax. Can transmissions become mixed up?\r\nA. Being bi-faxual can be confusing, but so long as you use a cover with each one you won't transmit anything you're not supposed to.\r\n\r\nQ. Is getting faxed by one person the same as with another?\r\nA. No. Even though many people (especially lawyers) would like you to believe that the longer they are faxing you the better you will like it. In reality the best fax is short, of high quality, and very graphic.\r\n\r\nQ. There is a man I'd very much like to fax (I've tried several times) but he can't seem to keep his equipment up long enough. Is there any thing I can do to help him?\r\nA. You could suggest that he contact a good fax therapist, such as Canon or Mitsubishi. If he refuses to take the suggestion, it would be best if you just wrote him off.",

        "body": "'Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual Yuletide celebration, and throughout our place of residence, kinetic activity was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential, including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus musculus. Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the wood-burning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose folkloric appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas. \r\n\r\nThe prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically through their cerebrums. My conjugal partner and I, attired in our nocturnal head coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the hibernal darkness when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the grounds there ascended such a cacophony of dissonance that I felt compelled to arise with alacrity from my place of repose for the purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof.\r\n\r\nHastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without, reflected as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline recipitation, might be said to rival that of the solar meridian itself - thus permitting my incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a miniature airborne runnered conveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer, piloted by a minuscule, aged chauffeur so ebullient and nimble that it became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our anticipated caller. With his ungulate motive power travelling at what may possibly have been more vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators, he vociferated loudly, expelled breath musically through contracted labia, and addressed each of the octet by his or her respective cognomen - \"Now Dasher, now Dancer...\" et al. - guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through which structure I could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the 32 cloven pedal extremities.\r\n\r\nAs I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, and was performing a 180-degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved - with utmost celerity and via a downward leap - entry by way of the smoke passage. He was clad entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebony residue from oxidations of carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls thereof. His resemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the plethora of assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious cloth receptacle.\r\n\r\nHis orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity, while his submaxillary dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging amiability. The capillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance were engorged with blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the former approximating the coloration of Albion's floral emblem, the latter that of the Prunus avium, or sweet cherry. His amusing sub- and supralabials resembled nothing so much as a common loop knot, and their ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared like small, tabular and columnar crystals of frozen water. \r\n\r\nClenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose grey fumes, forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a decorative seasonal circlet of holly. His visage was wider than it was high, and when he waxed audibly mirthful, his corpulent abdominal region undulated in the manner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical container. He was, in short, neither more nor less than an obese, jocund, multigenarian gnome, the optical perception of whom rendered me visibly frolicsome despite every effort to refrain from so being. By rapidly lowering and then elevating one eyelid and rotating his head slightly to one side, he indicated that trepidation on my part was groundless. \r\n\r\nWithout utterance and with dispatch, he commenced filling the aforementioned appended hosiery with various of the aforementioned articles of merchandise extracted from his aforementioned previously dorsally transported cloth receptacle. Upon completion of this task, he executed an abrupt about- face, placed a single manual digit in lateral juxtaposition to his olfactory organ, inclined his cranium forward in a gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith affected his egress by renegotiating (in reverse) the smoke passage. He then propelled himself in a short vector onto his conveyance, directed a musical expulsion of air through his contracted oral sphincter to the antlered quadrupeds of burden, and proceeded to soar aloft in a movement hitherto observable chiefly among the seed-bearing portions of a common weed. But I overheard his parting exclamation, audible immediately prior to his vehiculation beyond the limits of visibility: \"Ecstatic Yuletide to the planetary constituency, and to that self same assemblage, my sincerest wishes for a salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly pleasurable period between sunset and dawn.\"",

Oh, and as you have mentioned 10 TIMES by now, you only smoke when you drink.\r\n\r\n12. You yell at the barman, who (you think) cheated you by giving you just tonic, but that's just because you can no longer taste the Vodka.\r\n\r\n13. You think you're in bed, but your pillow feels strangely like pizza..\r\n\r\n14. You start every conversation with a booming, \"Don't take this the wrong way but...\"\r\n\r\n15. You fail to notice that the toilet lid's down when you sit on it.\r\n\r\n16. Your sloppy hugs begin to resemble wrestling take-down moves.\r\n\r\n17. You no longer smell of Chanel No.5 and instead reek of a pot-pourri of vomit and Heineken.\r\n\r\n18. You're out-burping the lads.\r\n\r\n19. You just HAVE to tell your friends that you love them so much, just one more time.\r\n\r\n20. You're at a table of strangers, flashing your tits, and you don't remember how you got there.\r\n\r\n21. You're so tired so you just sit on the floor.\r\n\r\n22. You smile to yourself like a some lunatic off the happy bus, unable to speak and have pint of soda water in your left hand and a bottle of bud in the right. Oh - and you have lost your keys, phone, money and bank cards",

And Student spread the Ten Commandments of College to all. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI- Thou Shalt Nap \r\n\r\nAnd God gave unto Student a great gift, the gift of napping. God said to him, You shall spend half your day napping. You shall nap in class, in your room and in your friend's room. And God said, if you don't nap, you will not be able to stay up all night drinking. And Student said, Nap I shall, and it was good. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nII- Thou Shalt Get Sick All the Time \r\n\r\nNow God said to Student, you must be sick all of the time. And student said why. And God said unto him, you shall share drinks, stay up too late, drink too much and make out with people you don't know. Therefore, God said, you shall be sick all year round. But God said, blessed are the sick for they have partied the hardest. And it was good. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIII- Thou Shalt Write Witty Away Messages \r\n\r\nStudent asked, but God, how will I show everyone that I am funny? And God said unto him, thou shall write witty away messages. God said to student, you shall never just say you are in the shower, you shall say you are getting wet and wild...in the shower. You shall never say you are at class, you shall say you are sleeping...in class. God said, if you do not write witty away messages, I shall smite you. Blessed are the funny, for they will get many girls to be their friends but never hook up with them. And it was good. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIV- Thou Shalt Wear a Hoodie \r\n\r\nAnd then Student asked God, God how do I look like a college kid. And God said unto student, you must wear a hoodie, for it is a useful garment. And you shall never wash it either. Student asked God what kind of Hoodie should it be and God said, you shall own one with your school's logo on it and you shall own many others of varying colors and creeds. And Student was pleased and God was pleased. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nV- Thou Shalt Shit a Lot \r\n\r\nAnd Student asked of his bathroom habit and God told him, Student, you shall eat in the Cafeteria and you shall shit a lot. And it will not be good shit, it will be the shit of the devil for your ass shall burn for hours. Your school shall put laxatives in their food and you shall feel their pain. And Student began to weep, and God said unto him, Student, fear not the shit, for all your fellow students will be experiencing the same. And Student dried his eyes and thanked God and God told him to use wet naps to ease the pain. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVI- Thou Shalt Eat EasyMac \r\n\r\nStudent asked unto God if there was any alternatives to the cafeteria, and God said to him, you shall eat a lot of EasyMac. It is easy to make and you don't need milk or a stove. And student said microwaves were forbidden by the RA. And God said to him, you shall hide the microwave under your bed with a towel on top. And Student asked, what if it is discovered. And God told him to stop being such a pussy, and it was good. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVII- Thou Shalt Hook Up \r\n\r\nStudent then asked of sex. And God said, Student, you shall hook up and be happy. You shall go home with random people every weekend and forget about them the next day. You shall see them at class and be awkward amongst their company. You shall exchange saliva at bars and parties and it will be good. And Student became gleeful and God told Student to wrap it up because He knows where she has been, but Student does not. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVIII- Thou Shalt Join a Club and Never Go to Meetings \r\n\r\nStudent inquired of his spare time and God reminded him that he should be napping. But Student said he wanted to do other things. So God said unto him, you shall join a club at the beginning of the semester, but then never go to meetings. And Student asked why he should not go to meetings, and God told him, because the glee club is gay. And Student understood His wisdom. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIX- Thou Shalt Wake Up Confused \r\n\r\nGod said to Student, there will come many a day when you shall wake up in the bed of another and not know where you are. You will not remember what you did last night and you shall be confused. You will see that you have nipple rings and a tattoo now and are covered in Sharpie. And Student was disturbed by this, but God said, you shall tell great stories about it to your friends someday. And Student understood and God took a sip of a beer. \r\n\r\nAnd God gave Student the final Commandment \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nX- Thou Shalt Gain Weight \r\n\r\nAnd Student wished to hear the final commandment and God said he would not like it. But Student insisted, so God said unto him, you shall gain weight. However, God said, you will not buy new clothes, so you will wear sweat pants a lot. God said, Student, you will watch a lot of TV and become fat to which Student wept profusely. But God comforted Student saying, you will still get ass even if you cannot tie your shoes anymore. Student felt better and God pointed to Student's chest saying, those will soon be bitch tits.

Why was that gauge used? \r\nBecause that's the way they built them in England, and the US railroads were built by English expatriates. Why did the English people build them like that? Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's the gauge they used. Why did \"they\" use that gauge then? Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing. Why did the wagons use that odd wheel spacing? Well, if they tried to use any other spacing the wagons would break on the old long distance roads, because that's the spacing of the old wheel ruts. So who built these old rutted roads? The first long distance roads in Europe were built by \r\nImperial Rome for the benefit of their Legions. The roads have been used ever since. And the ruts? The initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagons, were first made by Roman war chariots. \r\nSince the chariots were made for or by Imperial Rome they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing. Thus, we have the answer to the original questions. The United States standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches \r\nderives from the original specification for an Imperial Roman army war chariot. Specs and Bureaucracies live forever. So, the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horse's behind came up with it, you \r\nmay be exactly right. Because the Imperial Roman chariots were made to be just wide enough to accommodate the back-ends of two warhorses.",

He then realized that (1) he could not get to the money from where he was,(2) he could not climb back out the window through which he had entered, and (3) he was bleeding pretty badly. So he located a phone and dialed \"911\" for help...\r\n(Virginia): Two men in a pickup truck went to a new-home site to steal a refrigerator. Banging up walls, floors, etc., they snatched a refrigerator from one of the houses, and loaded it onto the pickup. The truck promptly got stuck in the mud, so these brain surgeons decided that the refrigerator was too heavy. Banging up *more* walls, floors, etc., they put the refrigerator BACK into the house, and returned to the pickup truck, only to realize that they locked the keys in the truck - so they abandoned it.\r\n(Virginia): A man walked into a 7-11 convenience store, put a $20 bill on the counter and asked for change. When the clerk opened the cash drawer, the man pulled a gun and asked for all the cash in the register, which the clerk promptly provided. The man took the cash from the clerk and fled - leaving the $20 bill on the counter. The total amount of cash he got from the drawer?

        "body": "21 Reasons Why Star Wars Is Better Than Titanic\" \r\n\r\n1. The Titanic is big, but it doesn't have hyperdrive. \r\n\r\n2. Yoda could use the Force to lift Titanic out of the water. \r\n\r\n3. Leia is a princess, a senator, a freedom fighter, and Jedi material; Rose is just marriage bait. \r\n\r\n4. Ewoks throw better parties than either first class or steerage. \r\n\r\n5. When flying towards the Titanic, Wedge can't say, \"Look at the size of that thing!\" and really mean it. \r\n\r\n6. It would be much scarier to get chased around the boat by a raving madman with a lightsaber as opposed to a handgun. \r\n\r\n7. Titanic is egalitarian by portraying poor people as sympathetic characters. \r\nStar Wars is egalitarian by promoting bug-eyed amphibians to Admiral. \r\n\r\n8. Said bug-eyed amphibious Admiral manages NOT to lose his ship. \r\n\r\n9. We know Cal is the bad guy because he sneers at the poor and treats his fiancee like property. We know Darth Vader is the bad guy because he strangles people and blows up planets for fun. \r\n\r\n10. Yeah, Leo can dance, but can he fly an X-wing? \r\n\r\n11. Rose braves icy water to rescue her man. Leia braves Jabba the Hutt. \r\n\r\n12. There are always enough escape pods in Star Wars. \r\n\r\n13. Do you know what the Empire does to self-proclaimed \"kings of the world?\" \r\n\r\n14. If Luke were handcuffed to a pipe below decks in a sinking ship, he would use the Force to get the key. \r\n\r\n15. Nothing has the same sting as \"I'd rather kiss a Wookie.\" \r\n\r\n16. Han is frozen in carbonite and turned into a wall ornament. Leo simply freezes. \r\n\r\n17. Han Solo would've steered clear of that stinkin' iceberg! \r\n\r\n18. We knew the boat was gonna sink. But who could've anticipated, \"Luke....I am your father.\"? \r\n\r\n19. Stormtroopers blast big holes in stupid minor characters; everyone in Titanic was a stupid minor character. \r\n\r\n20. When Star Wars was proclaimed coolest movie of all time by half of planet earth, George Lucas did not make a dork of himself at the Oscars. \r\n\r\n21. Titanic morals: \r\na. gamble, \r\nb. cheat on your husband, \r\n \r\nStar Wars morals: \r\na. fight evil, \r\nb. do good, \r\nc. respect all life even if it's ugly and slithers, \r\nd. rescue princess, \r\ne. save planet.",

If no Oriental rug is available, shag is good.\r\nDOORS:\r\nDo not allow closed doors in any room. To get a door opened, stand on your hind legs and scratch loudly. Once the door is opened, it is considered bad form to go through it.\r\nAfter you have ordered an outside door opened, stand halfway in and out and think about several things. This is particularly important during very cold weather, rain, snow, and mosquito season.\r\nGUESTS:\r\nQuickly determine which guest hates cats the most. Sit on that human's lap. If you can, arrange to have \"Friskies Fish n' Glop\" on your breath.\r\nFor sitting on laps or rubbing against clothing, select fabric color which contrasts well with your fur. For example: white furred cats should go to black wool clothing.\r\nFor the guest who claims, \"I love kitties,\" be ready with aloof disdain; apply claws to clothing or use a quick nip on the ankle.\r\nWhen walking among the dishes on the dinner table, be prepared to look surprised and hurt when scolded. The idea is to convey, \"But you always allow me on the table when company isn't here.\"\r\nAlways accompany guests to the bathroom. It isn't necessary to do anything; just sit and stare.\r\nWORK:\r\nIf one of your humans is sewing or writing and another is idle, stay with the busy one. This is called helping, but is known to humans as hampering.\r\nFollowing are the rules for hampering: \r\nA. When supervising cooking, sit just behind the left heel of the cook. You can't be seen and thereby stand a better chance of being stepped on, picked up and consoled.\r\nB. For book readers, get in close under the chin, between the human's eyes and the book, unless you can lie across the book itself. If it is a newspaper, claw at it until shredded. Your human will appreciate a home-made toy.\r\nC. For knitting projects, curl up quietly onto the lap of the knitter and pretend to doze. Occasionally reach out and slap the knitting needles or grab the yarn in your mouth. The knitter may try to distract you with a scrap ball of yarn, but don't be fooled by this maneuver. Remember, the aim is to hamper work.\r\nPLAY: \r\nPlay is important. Get enough sleep in the daytime so you are fresh for playing catch mouse or king-o'-the-hill on their bed between 2 am and 4 am.\r\nMOST IMPORTANT: Begin people training early. You will then have a smooth-running household. Humans need to know basic rules. They can be taught if you start early and are consistent. Good luck!",

I don't want my day to consist of computer crashes, mountains of paperwork, depressing news, how to survive more days in the month than there is money in the bank, doctor bills, gossip, illness, and loss of loved ones.\r\nI want to believe in the power of smiles, hugs, a kind word, truth, justice, peace, dreams, the imagination, mankind, and making angels in the snow.\r\nSo . . . here's my checkbook and my car-keys, my credit card bills and my 401K statements. I am officially resigning from adulthood.\r\nAnd if you want to discuss this further, you'll have to catch me first, cause..............\"Tag! You're it.\"",

Leaves and corn. And what are these? Vegetables.\r\nSo a kabab is nothing more than an efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. \r\nNeed grain?\r\nEat chicken.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Should I reduce my alcohol intake?\r\nA: No, not at all. Wine is made from fruit. Brandy is distilled wine, that means they take the water out of the fruity bit so you get even more of the goodness that way. Beer is also made out of grain. \r\nIts only the misconception, that narrow minded people have. So, Bottoms up!\r\n \r\nQ: Aren't fried foods bad for you? \r\nA: YOU'RE NOT LISTENING!!! Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. How could getting more vegetables be bad for you? \r\n \r\nQ: Is chocolate bad for me? \r\nA: Are you crazy? HELLO ...... Cocoa beans ... another vegetable ! It's the best feel-good food around! \r\n \r\nQ: Is swimming good for your figure?\r\nA: If swimming is good for your figure, explain whales to me. \r\n \r\nQ: Is getting in shape important for my lifestyle?\r\nA: Hey! 'Round' is a shape!\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had about food and diets..........",

It will blow you away.\r\n\r\nOne evening a grandson was talking to his grandmother about current events.The grandson asked his grandmother what she thought about the shootings at schools, the computer age, and just things in general.\r\n\r\nThe grandma replied, \"Well, let me think a minute. I was born before:\r\n\r\n* television\r\n* penicillin\r\n* polio shots\r\n* frozen foods\r\n* Xerox\r\n* contact lenses\r\n* Frisbees and\r\n* the pill\r\n\r\nThere were no:\r\n* credit cards\r\n* laser beams or\r\n* ball-point pens\r\n\r\nMan had not invented:\r\n* pantyhose\r\n* air conditioners\r\n* dishwashers\r\n* clothes dryers\r\n* and the clothes were hung out to dry in the fresh air and man hadn't yet walked on the moon.\r\n\r\nYour grandfather and I got married first, . . . and then lived together.\r\nEvery family had a father and a mother.\r\nUntil I was 25, I called every man older than me, \"Sir\".And after I turned 25, I still called policemen and every man with a title, \"Sir.\"\r\nWe were before gay-rights, computer- dating, dual careers, daycare centers,and group therapy.\r\nOur lives were governed by the Ten Commandments, good judgment, and common sense.\r\nWe were taught to know the difference between right and wrong and to stand up and take responsibility for our actions.\r\nServing your country was a privilege; living in this country was a bigger privilege.\r\nWe thought fast food was what people ate during Lent.\r\nHaving a meaningful relationship meant getting along with your cousins.\r\nDraft dodgers were people who closed their front doors when the evening breeze started.\r\nTime-sharing meant time the family spent together in the evenings and weekends-not purchasing condominiums.\r\nWe never heard of FM radios, tape decks, CDs, electric typewriters, yogurt,or guys wearing earrings.\r\nWe listened to the Big Bands, Jack Benny, and the President's speeches on our radios.\r\nI don't ever remember any kid blowing his brains out listening to Tommy Dorsey.\r\nIf you saw anything with 'Made in Japan' on it, it was junk.\r\nThe term 'making out' referred to how you did on your school exam.\r\nPizza Hut, McDonald's, and instant coffee were unheard of.\r\nWe had 5 &10-cent stores where you could actually buy things for 5 and 10 cents.\r\nIce-cream cones, phone calls, rides on a streetcar, and a Pepsi were all a nickel.\r\nAnd if you didn't want to splurge, you could spend your nickel on enough stamps to mail 1 letter and 2 postcards.\r\nYou could buy a new Chevy Coupe for $600, . . . but who could afford one?\r\nToo bad, because gas was 11 cents a gallon.\r\n\r\nIn my day:\r\n* \"grass\" was mowed,\r\n* \"coke\" was a cold drink,\r\n* \"gay\" meant happy\r\n* \"pot\" was something your mother cooked in and\r\n* \"rock music\" was your grandmother's lullaby.\r\n* \"Aids\" were helpers in the Principal's office,\r\n* \" chip\" meant a piece of wood,\r\n* \"hardware\" was found in a hardware store and\r\n* \"software\" wasn't even a word.\r\n\r\nAnd we were the last generation to actually believe that a lady needed a husband to have a baby. No wonder people call us \"old and confused\" and say there is a generation gap... and how old do you think I am?\r\n\r\nThe woman would probably be around 58!",

        "body": "Why isn't God helping us? Some people ask this question. Well, here's an answer.\r\n\r\n      Billy Graham's daughter was being interviewed on the Early Show and Jane Clayson asked her \"How could God let something like this happen?\" Anne Graham gave an extremely profound and insightful response.\r\n\r\n      She said \"I believe that God is deeply saddened by this, just as we are, but for years we've been telling God to get out of our schools, to get out of our government and to get out of our lives. And being the gentleman that He is, I believe that He has calmly backed out. How can we expect God to give us His blessing and His protection if we demand that He leave us alone?\"\r\n\r\n     I know there's been a lot of emails going around in regards to 9/11/01, but this really makes you think. If you don't have time, at least skim through it, but the bottom line is something to think about.... in light of recent events... terrorists attack, school shootings, etc.\r\n\r\n     Let's see, I think it started when Madeline Murray O'Hare (she was murdered, her body was found recently) complained she didn't want any prayer in our schools, and we said OK.\r\n\r\n     Then, someone said you better not read the Bible in school... the Bible that says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, and love your neighbor as yourself. And we said, OK.\r\n\r\n     Then, Dr. Benjamin Spock said we shouldn't spank our children when they misbehave because their little personalities would be warped and we might damage their self-esteem (Dr. Spock's son committed suicide), and we said, an expert should know what he's talking about so we said OK.\r\n\r\n     Then, someone said teachers and principals better not discipline our children when they misbehave. And the school administrators said no faculty member in this school better touch a student when they misbehave because we don't want any bad publicity, and we surely don't want to be sued (There's a big difference between disciplining and touching, beating, smacking, humiliating, kicking, etc.) And we said, OK.\r\n\r\n     Then someone said, let's let our daughters have abortions if they want, and they won't even have to tell their parents. And we said, OK.\r\n\r\n     Then some school board member said, since boys will be boys and they're going to do it anyway, let's give our sons all the condoms they want, so they can have all the fun they desire, and we won't have to tell their parents they got them at school. And we said, OK.\r\n\r\n     Then some of our top elected officials said it doesn't matter what we do in private as long as we do our jobs. And agreeing with them, we said it doesn't matter to me what anyone, including the President, does in private as long as I have a job and the economy is good.\r\n\r\n     And then someone said let's print magazines with pictures of nude women and call it wholesome, down-to-earth appreciation for the beauty of the female body. And we said, OK.\r\n\r\n     And then someone else took that appreciation a step further and published pictures of nude children and then stepped further still by making them available on the internet. And we said OK, they're entitled to their free speech.\r\n\r\n     And then the entertainment industry said, let's make TV shows and movies that promote profanity, violence, and illicit sex. And let's record music that encourages rape, drugs, murder, suicide, and satanic themes. And we said it's just entertainment, it has no adverse effect, and nobody takes it seriously anyway, so go right ahead.\r\nNow we're asking ourselves why our children have no conscience, why they don't know right from wrong, and why it doesn't bother them to kill strangers, their classmates, and themselves.\r\n\r\n     Probably, if we think about it long and hard enough, we can figure it out. I think it has a great deal to do with \"WE REAP WHAT WE SOW.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Dear God, Why didn't you save the little girl killed in her classroom?\" Sincerely, Concerned Student... AND THE REPLY \"Dear Concerned Student, I am not allowed in schools\". Sincerely, God.\r\n\r\n     Funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world's going to hell. Funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what the Bible says.\r\n\r\n     Funny how everyone wants to go to heaven provided they do not have to believe, think, say, or do anything the Bible says.\r\n\r\n    Funny how someone can say \"I believe in God\" but still follow Satan who, by the way, also \"believes\" in God. \r\n\r\n    Funny how we are quick to judge but not to be judged. \r\n\r\n    Funny how you can send a thousand 'jokes' through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing.\r\n\r\n    Funny how the lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene pass freely through cyberspace, but the public discussion of God is suppressed in the school and workplace. Funny how someone can be so fired up for worship once a week, but be invisible to their religion the rest of the week.\r\n\r\n    Are you laughing?\r\n\r\n    Funny how when you go to forward this message, you will not send it to many on your address list because you're not sure what they believe, or what they will think of you for sending it to them. Funny how I can be more worried about what other people think of me than what God thinks of me.\r\n\r\n     Are you thinking?",

Besides, I already know what the captain of the football team is doing these days: mowing my lawn.\r\n \r\nNew Rule: Don't eat anything that's served to you out a window unless you're a seagull. People are acting all shocked that a human finger was found in a bowl of Wendy's chili. Hey, it cost less than a dollar. What did you expect it to contain? Trout?\r\n \r\nNew Rule: Stop saying that teenage boys who have sex with their hot, blonde teachers are permanently damaged. I have a better description for these kids: lucky bastard.\r\n \r\nNew Rule: Ladies, leave your eyebrows alone. Here's how much men care about your eyebrows: do you have two of them? Okay, we're done.\r\n \r\nNew Rule: There's no such thing as flavored water. There's a whole aisle of this crap at the supermarket, water, but without that watery taste. Sorry, but flavored water is called a soft drink. You want flavored water?  Pour some scotch over ice and let it melt. That's your flavored water.\r\n \r\nNew Rule: The more complicated the Starbucks order, the bigger the dope. If you walk into a Starbucks and order a \"decaf grande half-soy, half-low fat, iced vanilla, double-shot, gingerbread cappuccino, extra dry, light ice, with one Sweet-n'-Low and one NutraSweet,\" Oooh, you're a huge dope.\r\n \r\nNew Rule: Just because your tattoo has Chinese characters in it doesn't make you spiritual. It's right above the crack of your ass. And it translates to \"beef with broccoli.\" The last time you did anything spiritual, you were praying to God you weren't pregnant. You're not spiritual. You're just high.\r\n \r\nNew Rule: Competitive eating isn't a sport. It's one of the seven deadly sins. ESPN recently televised the US Open of Competitive Eating, because watching those athletes at the poker table was just too damned exciting. What's next, competitive farting? Oh wait. They're already doing that. It's called \"The Howard Stern Show.\"\r\n \r\nNew Rule: I don't need a bigger mega M&M. If I'm extra hungry for M&Ms, I'll go nuts and eat two.\r\n \r\nNew Rule: If you're going to insist on making movies based on crappy, old television shows, then you have to give everyone in the Cineplex a remote so we can see what's playing on the other screens. Let's remember the reason something was a television show in the first place is that the idea wasn't good enough to be a movie.\r\n \r\nNew Rule: No more gift registries. You know, it used to be just for weddings. Now it's for babies and new homes and graduations from rehab. Picking out the stuff you want and having other people buy it for you isn't gift giving, it's the adult  version of looting.",

        "body": "Tips for calling a business that has an answering service.  When you get the answering service, please remember these vital tips.\r\n\r\n\r\n1) When you call a lockout company, make sure you give the operator the telephone number on your account.  It's considered proper procedure for the locksmith to drive to the office to look up an alternate number where you'll be at, and then drive to you. I believe it's quicker that way too.\r\n\r\n2) After giving your last name to the operator on the line, and they ask for your first, It's ok to just say Mr or Mrs. Your voice can be deceiving as some people just may not have hit puberty by age 45. \r\n\r\n3) If you're calling your apartment complex because your toilet is overflowing and you cant shut the water off, please go and get some coffee.  The maintenance people dont need you at home to get inside. that's what they make credit cards for.\r\n\r\n4) If it's July, and your a/c hasnt worked for 2 months, please call at 2am. Our service reps are just switching shifts and the new shift will be nice and rested to drive to the edge of the boondocks for you.\r\n\r\n5) If you just happen to be a nurse, and you're calling for a doctor that's new to the hospital, dont worry about what extention ICU is. He's a doctor and he's memorized all of the hospital's codes for every city before he graduates medschool. He remembers best when its 2 am.\r\n\r\n6) No, sir, i'm sorry. A/C technicians don't make house calls. Please bring your outside Heating and Air Conditioning unit into the shop to get repaired.\r\n\r\nAnd the final tip is...\r\n\r\nIf you're a patient and you're calling your doctor afterhours because the medication he's prescribed for you isnt working properly, please let the operator on the line know your whole medical history. The more they know, the better they can help you! (everyone else calling can wait!!!)",

Axis of Evil members, however, immediately dismissed the new axis as having, for starters, a really dumb name. \"Right. They are Just as Evil...in their dreams!\" declared North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. \"Everybody knows we're the best evils... best at being evil... we're the best.\" \r\n\r\nDiplomats from Syria denied they were jealous over being excluded, although they conceded they did ask if they could join the Axis of Evil. \"They told us it was full,\" said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. \"An Axis can't have more than three countries,\" explained Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. \"This is not my rule, it's tradition. In World War II you had Germany, Italy, and Japan in the evil Axis. So you can only have three. And a secret handshake. Ours is wicked cool.\" \r\n\r\nTHE AXIS PANDEMIC International reaction to Bush's Axis of Evil declaration was swift, as within minutes, France surrendered. Elsewhere, peer-conscious nations rushed to gain triumvirate status in what became a game of geopolitical chairs. Cuba, Sudan, and Serbia said they had formed the Axis of Somewhat Evil, forcing Somalia to join with Uganda and Myanmar in the Axis of Occasionally Evil, while Bulgaria, Indonesia, and Russia established the Axis of Not So Much Evil Really As Just Generally Disagreeable. With the criteria suddenly expanded and all the desirable clubs filling up, Sierra Leone, El Salvador, and Rwanda applied to be called the Axis of Countries That Aren't the Worst But Certainly Won't Be Asked to Host the Olympics; Canada, Mexico, and Australia formed the Axis of Nations That Are Actually Quite Nice But Secretly Have Nasty Thoughts About America, while Spain, Scotland, and New Zealand established the Axis of Countries That Be Allowed to Ask Sheep to Wear Lipstick. \"That's not a threat, really, just something we like to do,\" said Scottish Executive First Minister Jack McConnell. While wondering if the other nations of the world weren't perhaps making fun of him, a cautious Bush granted approval for most axes, although he rejected the establishment of the Axis of Countries Whose Names End in \"Guay,\" accusing one of its members of filing a false application. Officials from Paraguay, Uruguay, and Chadguay denied the charges. \r\n\r\nIsrael, meanwhile, insisted it didn't want to join any Axis, but privately, world leaders said that's only because no one asked them.",

        "body": "WARNING: This describes the cruel, mental torture of innocent toy store employees. Readers under the age of 13 should be accompanied by an adult.\r\n\r\nAn \"Anti-shopping\" Trip with the Los Angeles Cacophony Society \r\nby Rev. Al\r\n\r\nI had been thinking for a long time about making cement filled teddy bears. I wasn't exactly sure why. At first it was just a perceptual curiosity I wanted to experience, and I wanted others to experience: the idea of being handed what appeared to be a fluffy stuffed animal, only to have it go tearing through your relaxed fingers like a lead meteor. \r\n\r\nThe Christmas shopping season seemed an ideal time to get them on the shelves of Los Angeles toy stores, so late in November, members of the Los Angeles Cacophony Society gathered in my backyard to gut several dozen plush toys and replace their innards with Portland's finest. \r\n\r\nWe called them, \"Cement Cuddlers.\"\r\n\r\nEach bear wore a full-color laminated label identifying it as such complete with bar code from another toy. Inside the folded tag was the text:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunate Child, do not mistake me for a living thing, nor seek in me the warmth denied you by your parents. For beneath my plush surface lies a hardness as impervious and unforgiving as this World's own indifference to your mortal struggle. Hold on to me when you are sad, and I will weigh you down, but bear this weight throughout your years, and it will strengthen your limbs and harden your will so that one day no man dare oppose you. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe target was easy to select. Not far away was a large not-to-be-named toy store, the biggest and newest of the chain in Southern California; a massive thing like the newly christened Titanic just begging for its iceberg. \r\n\r\nBy 10:30, around a dozen Cacophonists had slipped in managing to place several bears on the shelves without arousing suspicion. Not content to just leave them there we appointed Cacophonist Todd to help direct the management's attention to our prank. At 10:35 Todd entered, located a Cuddler, and brought it to the register, informing the cashier he couldn't find the price. \r\n\r\nPredictably, as he placed the innocent looking toy in those unwary hands, it went crashing to the floor like a particularly heavy bowling ball. After this, it just got worse. Todd began to demand a speedier price check, insisting that he had only minutes to complete this transaction before it would be too late to bring the bear to his nephew who was, as he repeated many times for our benefit, \"in the hospital with a skin rash.\" This element of his story, however, did not appear to provoke the suspicion of the clerk, who apparently had no difficulty in imagining her customer entering the children's ward not long before 11 PM to dump a lump of fur-covered construction material in the lap of an ailing youngster. \r\n\r\nHowever, as Todd's volume increased, backups arrived. One of the more astute clerks commented that she had never seen this toy before and wished to know what shelf it had come from. Indignantly, Todd led them to the appropriate place. A half dozen clerks, and several customers gathered round in bewilderment, passing the four bears amongst themselves and shaking their heads. \r\n\r\nI eventually moved into earshot, and heard one woman reading the tag aloud. \"That's really deep!\" she exclaimed. I could no longer resist. I moved in to express curiosity about this toy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! That's a cute bear,\" I remarked as I reached for a Cuddler. Without warning, it was placed in my hands, which (naturally) were prepared to be unprepared for its weight. Another thunderous crash! \r\n\r\nNow I was outraged! \"Look here!\" I said. \"The labels say, for ages 2-10! How could \"Nameless Toy Store Chain\" sell such a dangerous toy to 2-year-olds!\"\r\n\r\nEventually I was calmed and began contemplating buying one for an older nephew. Cacophonist Frank became interested in buying one too. We all went to the register. \r\n\r\nThanks to the fully functional bar code, the farce continued. However, the bar code used was from another toy, and so the computer identified the toy as: Alien Face Hugger - $1.99. More panic and confusion. The manager was called. In the chaos, the bears are handed back and forth a few times more giving Todd one more opportunity to let one fall, this time \"on his foot\" (about 4 inches from his toes). He begins to wail and pulls off his shoe and sock. The clerks are incredulous. \r\n\r\n\"Would you say he dropped that on his foot?\" one says to me.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to get involved,\" I say, secretly gesturing that Todd seems crazy.\r\n\r\nThe manager arrives, and he is young and sour-looking. Easily a control freak. We feel he is our divinely ordained victim. \r\n\r\nThey explain the difficulty with the scans, but he seems to pay little attention to the computer. Instead his eyes keep darting to Todd as he leaps around on one foot howling about the lethal bears to other customers. \r\n\r\n\"Come with me, sir. We'll see what we can do for you,\" he snaps, dragging Todd off to his little manager pen.\r\n\r\nFrank and I continue as good cops to Todd's bad cop routine, but continue to hover at the register insisting on the purchase. We discuss with the clerks how troubled Todd seems and reread the label. \r\n\r\n\"This is weird,\" one clerk finally realizes, \"a Teddy Bear literally filled with cement.\"\r\n\r\nI suggest it might be a door stop for children's bedrooms.\r\n\r\nThen a ray of light descends on Nameless Toy Store. \"It's like a joke someone's playing or something,\" says one of our blue-vested assistants. \r\n\r\n\"You mean,\" asks Frank, with wonderfully stylized naivete, \"like someone made them themselves? Maybe just this weekend? Took out the stuffing and replaced it with cement?\"\r\n\r\n\"Or maybe that crazy guy did,\" says the clerk. \r\n\r\n\"No, no. Can't be,\" I say. \"Why would he insist on buying from you something he made himself. That's illogical!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly we hear Todd's voice booming again from the front of the store.\r\n\r\nThey have emerged from the manager pen.\r\n\r\n\"This will mean so much to Bobby. God Bless you!\" And he leaves with the bear in bag. $1.99! Lucky dog!\r\n\r\nManager-man hurries to the counter with his panicky stick-up-the-rear gait, one ear pressed to a cellular, doubtlessly consulting the Nameless Toy Store overlords. We mob him, insisting to know the price arrived at. \r\n\r\n\"They're not for sale.\"\r\n\r\nWe are incredulous, indignant. \"This item is discontinued.\" He bites off the word and rushes to the shelves to haul the Cuddlers away. We continue to needle him as he gathers the bears. Suddenly, he swings around holding the furry blocks of cement as if he might do some harm. Perspiration has appeared on his forehead. \r\n\r\n\"Look!\" he sputters, \"I don't know how these things got on the shelves! They DON'T track correctly on the computer. I've never seen them before. I have NO explanation. It's like someone's playing a joke on MY STORE!\" \r\n\r\nIt's in that word \"my.\" You can tell. He's gotten that look like he's just seen the first crack in the brand new ceiling. We understand that if that crack widens by even a hairline, he's going to see through it. He already suspects Todd. He is probably 90 seconds from realizing that we're all part of it. \r\n\r\nAnd so we decide to take advantage of our time.\r\n\r\n\"Could you at least tell us the manufacturer so maybe we could order the toy?\"\r\n\r\nHe whips the label over, and reads, Brutal Truth Toys.\r\n\r\nThis is a good time to leave. There's still a half hour before midnight, so we take advantage of the energy we've gathered to make a few prank phone calls. I call a rival Nameless Toy Store asking for Cement Cuddlers.\r\n\r\nI'm put on hold and another clerk picks up the phone and claims to have actually pulled up the info on my Cement Cuddlers on the computer. He tells me I can get a rain check. Sadly, when I ask for the stock number, he suddenly loses the record that he \"just had, just a minute ago.\" \r\n\r\nAfter going through three or four baffled and fairly easy to baffle clerks, I finally get to the manager. I am slightly indignant at the delays and feigned ignorance of a product I JUST PURCHASED THAT VERY NIGHT at their rival, the new Burbank store, we'd just invaded. The manager explains that this new store carries certain promotional items not available to the other stores because it is the newest and largest. I detect a note of envy in his voice, and soften my approach. I become confidential and ask if the new store hired away a lot of good workers. \r\n\r\n\"You know,\" I tell him, \"I know it's big and everything, but it's so new... I mean, they didn't quite seem to have it all together yet.\" He agrees. He's heard rumors to this effect. \"All the employees seemed, I don't know... nervous somehow. It's like the store's too big for them to handle. I get a nervous feeling when I go in there.\" \r\n\r\nHe knows what I mean.\r\n\r\n\"I think it's that manager, maybe. He seemed so tense and kinda angry somehow. He doesn't give me a good feeling. He seems a little odd. Have you heard anything like this?\"\r\n\r\nHe's heard some funny things about this upstart.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. Odd manager. Odd store. Come to think of it this whole cement teddy bear thing is pretty odd. Maybe this was just a special thing he wanted to order. Maybe they were his idea.\" He agrees, but he won't call the other store to see if they still have them in stock there. So I tell him I'll check back later. \r\n\r\nAnd I will. It was a good night, and we still have 18 more bears to distribute.",

It's so easy to use even a child can operate it. Just lift its cover. Compact and portable, it can be used anywhere - even sitting in an armchair by the fire - yet it is powerful enough to hold as much information as a CD-ROM disk.\r\n\r\nHere's how it works: each BOOK is constructed of sequentially numbered sheets of paper (recyclable), each capable of holding thousands of bits of information. These pages are locked together with a custom-fit device called a binder which keeps the sheets in their correct sequence. By using both sides of each sheet, manufacturers are able to cut costs in half.\r\n\r\nEach sheet is scanned optically, registering information directly into your brain. A flick of the finger takes you to the next sheet. The BOOK may be taken up at any time and used by merely opening it. The \"Browse\" feature allows you to move instantly to any sheet, and move forward or backward as you wish. Most come with an \"index\" feature, which pinpoints the exact location of any selected information for instant retrieval.\r\n\r\nAn optional \"BOOKmark\" accessory allows you to open the BOOK to the exact place you left it in a previous session - even if the BOOK has been closed. BOOKmarks fit universal design standards; thus a single BOOKmark can be used in BOOKs by various manufacturers.\r\n\r\nPortable, durable and affordable, the BOOK is the entertainment wave of the future, and many new titles are expected soon, due to the surge in popularity of its programming tool, the Portable Erasable-Nib Cryptic Intercommunication Language Stylus.",

So if you don't leave a message after the tone, you might have to deal with me in person.\r\n\r\n* I can't come to the phone now, so if, well, actually, I CAN come to the phone now, I mean, like, I'm at the phone NOW, recording this message, but I'm doing this NOW, while you're listening to it LATER, except for you I guess it's NOW, like, when you're listening to it...I mean, like, wait, gosh.

To this day, \r\nmy sister has never let me forget. \r\n\r\nFOURTH TESTIMONY:\r\n\r\nWhile in line at the bank one afternoon, my toddler decided to release some pent-up energy and ran amok. I was finally able to grab hold of her after receiving looks of disgust \r\nand annoyance from other patrons.\r\nI told her that if she did not start behaving \"right now\" she would be punished. \r\nTo my horror, she said in a voice just as threatening, \"If you don't let me go right now, I will tell Grandma that I saw you kissing Daddy's pee-pee last night!\"\r\nThe silence was deafening after this enlightening exchange. \r\nEven the tellers stopped what they were doing. \r\nI mustered up the last of my dignity and walked out of the bank with my daughter in tow. The last thing I heard when \r\nthe door closed behind me, was screams of laughter. \r\n\r\nFIFTH TESTIMONY:\r\n\r\nHave you ever asked your child a question too many times?\r\nMy three-year-old son had a lot of problems with potty training and I was on him constantly. One day we stopped at Taco Bell for a quick lunch in between errands. \r\nIt was very busy, with a full dining room. \r\nWhile enjoying my taco, I smelled something funny, so of course I checked my seven-month-old daughter, she was clean. \r\nThe realized that Danny had not asked to go potty in a while. I asked him if he needed to go, and he said \"No\". \r\nI kept thinking \"Oh Lord, that child has had an accident, and I don't have any clothes with me.\" \r\nThen I said, \"Danny, are you SURE you didn't have an accident?\" \"No,\" he replied. \r\nI just KNEW that he must have had an accident, because the smell was getting worse.\r\nSoooooo, I asked one more time, \"Danny, did you have an accident?\"\r\nThis time he jumped up, yanked down his pants, bent over, \r\nspread his cheeks and yelled \"SEE MOM, IT'S JUST FARTS\" \r\nWhile 30 people nearly choked to death on their tacos laughing, he calmly pulled up his pants and sat down. \r\nAn old couple made me feel better, thanking me for the best laugh they'd ever had!\r\n\r\nLAST BUT NOT LEAST TESTIMONY: \r\n\r\nThis had most of the state of Michigan laughing for 2 days and a very embarrassed female news anchor who will, in the future, likely think before she speaks.\r\nWhat happens when you predict snow but don't get any!\r\nWe had a female news anchor that, the day after it was supposed to have snowed and didn't, turned to the weatherman and asked: \"So Bob, where's that 8 inches you promised me last night?\"\r\nNot only did HE have to leave the set, but half the crew did too they were laughing so hard!\r\n\r\nNow, didn't that feel good? \r\n\r\nPass it on to someone you know who needs a laugh and remember we all say things we don't really mean, so think before you speak.",

People who try and open a locked car door at the same time you are pressing the unlock. And they keep doing it over and over. For heaven sakes DAD, (I mean people who do this. lol) \r\n\r\n5. People who drive fansy sports cars, and they obviously think they are cool cuz they speed up and slow down quickly and change lanes in front of you. My FORD EXPLORER can and will crush your stupid uncool ass proudly. \r\n\r\n6. Straight people who think sexuality is a choice. \r\n\r\n7. Christians who think that they will win souls over to Jesus by telling non-Christians they are going to hell. Come on just quietly be clear that you love Jesus and pray that they will one day love Him too it is that simple. I have never told anyone that they are going to hell. \r\n\r\n8. People who think children make people happy. Children anywhere within 100 feet of me, make me want to pull my hair out one by one. \r\n\r\n9. People who bash the President, and think that that liberal sex maniac we had before is better. \r\n\r\n10. If you don't know something, for God sakes SAY \"I don't know.\" Stop sitting there straining your little brain trying to come up with a cool sounding explaination in order to make you look like you know something that you know absolutely NOTHING about. \r\n\r\n11. People who have a 4.0 in drawing, cartooning, and jewelry making, are no different than those who get a 2.0 in Calculas, Biology, and Chemestry. Ok you have an A but WHAT ARE YOU TAKING? \r\n\r\n12. Mexicans are not responsible for the demise of our country. When you talk about illegal immigrants talk about ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS NOT MEXICANS! If an Egyptian exchange student has an expired visa he is an illegal immagrant. If someone with really strong arms swam over here from Germany they are an illegal immigrant. Stop focusing on the Mexican boarder. \r\n\r\n13. People who buy clothes that are ripped up and bleached out, um I might have an old pair of jeans with the knee and crotch missing that you can have for free. Now you can save up and buy a Ford. \r\n\r\n14. People who text message just because they can. If you have something quick to say, or you are in an area where you can't talk by all means go ahead and text me, I pay for 400 messages a month, but if you are at home and have a thought that is more than three sentences long FOR GOD SAKES CALL ME.

Little Johnny did not shoot up his playground because he listened to Eminem and played Grand Theft Auto. PLEASE! \r\n\r\n16. People who think obese people are scum of the earth.

When you are driving down the street and you see a car in the middle lane with their blinker on waiting to turn across on coming traffic.....You are the only or one of the only cars coming at them....you have seen them since they appeared to be a little dot, and they sit there until you are so close you can read their licence plate and then they decide to turn, leaving you no choice but to slam on your brakes. Um what were you doing for the last 5 minutes I have been coming up on you YOU MORON! What kind of a licence do you have a fishing licence? \r\n\r\n18. When you are driving and the person in front of you turns their blinker on, starts slowing down, comes to almost a complete stop and then decides oh gee there is a middle lane maybe I should go there. GET INTO THE MIDDLE LANE AND THEN SLOW DOWN! WHO GAVE YOU YOUR LICENCE? \r\n\r\n19. People who drive down the street with their music blasting so loud YOUR car is literally shacking. Um can you even hear the words when it is that loud? Don't your ears hurt? \r\n\r\n20. Automated phone lines. For God sakes PAY SOMEONE TO PICK UP THE FREAKIN PHONE AND SAY HELLO THIS IS \"MR. BLA\" HOW MAY I HELP YOU THIS LOVELY SUNSHINNY AFTERNOON! \r\n\r\n21. Straight girls who think it's okay to hit lesbians really hard, because they figure well they are too macho to hit us back. Ok that is true I don't like slapping on girls and I won't..... but you little prissy girls don't know your own strength. OWCH. \r\n\r\n22. People who have LOUD conversations on their cell phones in public and when you look over, they give you this look like \"excuse me but your listening to a personal call.\" and its like well excuse me but if you would take it down to fog horn level I wouldn't have to listen. \r\n\r\n23. When your in a store and the electricity is out and the clerks don't know how to make change. Shouldn't you need to know basic math to handle a cash register? \r\n\r\n24. Girls who wear clothes that display all of their assets and they look at you like you pervert your staring at me. Its like well when your standing there like a human billboard advertising your products to the city WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? \r\n\r\n25. Girls that think it is okay to walk up and tell you something like oh man I just started my \"monthly\" or my bra is twisted, or oh man my underwear is riding up. Come on now that is the only think I am going to be thinking about all day now. Thanks for the info. NOT! \r\n\r\n26. People who get the wrong number more than once in a five minute period. Ok I did not call up my service provider and get my number changed in the last thirty seconds so if you dial the number on your napkin and it is me instead of whoever your tring to get a hold of, then chances are it will be me again if you hang up and automatically start dialing again. \r\n\r\n27. People who telephone solicite for not a product but a cause. It's like if I was interested in giving my pennies to support some disease then I would go online and do it, I don't need you calling me thank you very much. \r\n\r\n28. People who don't concider fish pets. Or if they do, they don't concider them important pets, its like oh don't bother to save him he was like three bucks. Man fish have their own personalities and uniquenesses just like dogs and cats. My Oscar is freakin smart man. He waggs his fin when I come in the room, if I as much as touch the drawer where his food is he starts dancing and jumping out of the water...splashing back down. He plays with decor like bath toys, I had to take a few things out cuz I thought he was going to break the tank, he pick stuff up and throw it against the glass. I guess that is entertaining??? Give the fine finned creatures a little credit and a little respect. \r\n\r\n29. Computers are suppose to make things easier. When using wizards unless you know what you are doing, don't bother, because in the time it takes to figure out the wizard you could have had your project done freehand three hours ago. So why do some people INSIST upon screaming crying and pulling their hair out over wizards because they think they should work. Ok they do work if you know how, if you don't it's not the end of the world experement sometime when you are not trying to get something important done for crying out loud. \r\n\r\n30. People who don't pull over for the cops, they run. It's like people PLEASE where do you think you are going. Out of 1000 people that run three might get away. The rest get an additional list of things they are going to jail for, and some weren't going to jail to begin with but they are now. STUPID. \r\n\r\n31. People who cause a traffic clog by coming to a complete stop to 'observe' a wreck. Ok here is the definition of a wreck, two or more cars collided, people are either going to the hospital or getting out to exchange information. No one is going to put on a puppet show near the wrecked vehicles so please move yours out of my way. \r\n\r\n32. People who drive with their blinkers on. Cuz you never know if they are seriously going to try and get in front of you or if they are just stupid. \r\n\r\n33.

The holidays when you go to three different stores, fight in three different parking lots, wait on twelve different employees to find a gift and then wait behind the old woman who lived in a shoe with her kids in the check out line while she swears her socks rang up fifty cents more and then the checker has to shut down her til and go check it out then come back, then you get the gift home and Christmas morning the person opens it gives it a quick once over with their eyes and then sets it next to them and grabs the next gift without as much as a thank you kiss my ass its raining in texas. \r\n\r\n40. Those stupid reality TV shows. I don't want any amount of money bad enough to do any of things they do on fear factor survivor.....

If he/she continues to strike, his/her shoelaces will be tied together for 2 frames. \r\n\r\nWhen you leave the 10-pin and you know you can't make the spare, but another member of your team can, invoke the \"Designated Bowler\" rule. \r\n\r\nAfter you have 4 splits in one game, you may say \"Kings X\" and take those 4 frames over. However, if you split on the 2nd time around, you accept it. After all, \"Fair is Fair\". \r\n\r\nIf your ball goes in the gutter and jumps back onto the lane, knocking dow pins, by golly, you get them! That's much harder than to knock them down the conventional way. Good bowling should be recognized. \r\n\r\nA ball should be declared dead when you bowl 3 games without a strike.

In short, many of the dire predictions for the year 2000 are much more likely to actually occur in the year 2038! Consider the year 2000 just a dry run.

About 3am one very cold morning, Trooper Allan Nixon #658 responded to a call there was a car off the shoulder of the road outside Shattuck. He located the car, stuck in deep snow, and with the engine still running. Pulling in behind the car with his emergency lights on, the Trooper walked to the driver's door to find an older man passed out behind the wheel with a nearly empty vodka bottle on the seat beside him.\r\n\r\nThe driver came awake when the Trooper tapped on the window. Seeing the rotating lights in his rearview mirror, and the State Trooper standing next to his car, the man panicked. He jerked the gearshift into 'drive' and hit the gas. The car's speedometer was showing 20, 30, 40 and then 50 mph, but it was still stuck in the snow, wheels spinning.\r\n \r\nTrooper Nixon, having a sense of humor, began running in place next to the speeding (but stationary) car.\r\nThe driver was totally freaked, thinking the Trooper was actually keeping up with him. This goes on for about 30 seconds, then the Trooper yelled, \"Pull over!\" \r\nThe man nodded, turned his wheel, and stopped the engine.\r\n \r\nNeedless to say, the man from Dumas, Texas was arrested, and is probably still shaking his head over the State Trooper in Oklahoma who could run 50 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nWho says Troopers don't have a sense of humor?",

She asks Lancelot, \"Will you rather I am this beautiful in the night, with you, or in the day, when company will see me?\"\r\nLancelot thinks for a minute, then says, \"You decide.\"\r\n\"Very good. You have been listening. Now, I will be beautiful all the time.\"\r\nThe moral of this story is that no matter how beautiful or how ugly she is, all women are witches.",

        "body": "Are you a wealthy and successful suit-and-tie yuppie businessman who has always had a secret dream and hope that you might one day become a redneck? \r\n\r\nHave you always wanted to be a Bubba and know the freedom of the redneck life, but didn't know how? \r\n\r\nIs there an inner Cletus inside that dapper and dignified executive image, just hollerin' to get out? \r\n\r\nYes, we are talking to YOU, Mister Suit and Tie!\r\n\r\nWell, now, Mister Corporate High-flyer, YOU can become the redneck you have always wanted to be! \r\n\r\n\r\nTOO GOOD TO BE TRUE? No! It's TRUE! \r\n\r\n\r\nPurchase the following: one pair of overalls, one pack of chewing tobacco, several extra strength large garbage bags and six cases of beer. That is all you will need to start! \r\n\r\n\r\nNow follow the 35 SIMPLE and EASY guidelines in our manual! \r\n\r\nREMEMBER. This transformation will not be easy! It requires courage and determination! When the going gets tough, just keep thinking of the freedom and the excitement of the Redneck life that waits for you! \r\n\r\nCaution: These instructions MUST be followed in your BUSINESS OFFICE during WORKING HOURS. The corporate environment is required. \r\n\r\nBefore you begin this exciting transformation, have a photograph taken of yourself as a well dressed yuppie executive. This is for comparison later! \r\n\r\nNow, follow the instructions carefully: \r\n\r\n1) We assume you are a dignified, impeccably-groomed yuppie executive; therefore, as you read this, it is also assumed you are wearing a pair of well-polished $800 Brooks Brothers black captoe leather shoes and silk business socks, a $2,000 pinstriped Armani business suit tailored for you, a $150 silk necktie with matching pocket square and suspenders, a starched white shirt, monogrammed cufflinks, silver tiepin and a Rolex. \r\n\r\nIf you are not dressed like this, or the equivalent, stop NOW and continue when you are. \r\n\r\nAs a successful executive you know that presentation is everything: perfect suit, shoes, hair, tie, car, home, teeth and briefcase. Well, it's the same with rednecks \u00e2\u0080\u0093 only in reverse. \r\n\r\nFIRST, untie and remove mirror-shined high-powered handmade executive shoes. Peel off fancy business socks. \r\n\r\nDO THIS NOW! This is NOT optional! \r\n\r\nBe warned: these shoes and socks have been vital to your identity until now, so do not deceive yourself; this will be a challenge to a true yuppie executive. They MUST be removed to move forward into the wonderful new world that awaits you. Until now, you have been told \"The first thing people notice are your shoes!\" From now on, SHOES ARE YOUR ENEMY! \r\n\r\n(Note: This will work with all shoes worn by high-class executives and other professionals, including Johnston & Murphy wingtips and those Italian loafers with those little tassels on them.) \r\n\r\n2) Stuff silk socks in shiny shoes and drop in garbage can. \r\n\r\n3) *URGENT* Do not, under any circumstances, put those shoes back on. You MUST remain barefoot. If you fail, return to step one. This will take discipline! This is where most would-be bubbas fail! \r\n\r\nYou will be STRONGLY tempted to put those fancy city shoes back on your feet - resist this! It will soon become natural. You will soon REFUSE to wear shoes - it sounds impossible, but it's true! Have courage! Persevere! \r\n\r\nIf you have trouble, don't hesitate to call our 800 emergency number. A bona fide trained Bubba coach will help you. \r\n\r\n4) The following is guaranteed to drag you off your corporate high horse in a hurry, and down into the redneck world! After this, you WON'T be able to get back on that corporate ladder! Trust us! \r\n\r\nPROP BARE FEET ON POLISHED OFFICE DESK, WITH SOLES FACING OPEN OFFICE DOOR. \r\n\r\nYes, you DID read this correctly! It will be a challenge to everything you have been in the past! But remember: the life of a Bubba is calling you! \r\n\r\nDo NOT remove bare feet from desk, even when co-workers, clients and/or boss enter office. \r\n\r\n5) Remove your monogrammed cufflinks and scratch the soles of your feet with them when others enter office and during office conference. Put the cufflinks back on. \r\n\r\n6) Use your classy silk made-in-France necktie to wipe nose. \r\n\r\n7) Use your silver tiepin and/or collar stud to clean toenails. Put the tiepin or collar stud back in tie or shirt. \r\n\r\n8) Eat lunch with a knife only. Wipe the dirty knife on otherwise impeccable business suit. Remember, you must UNLEARN all your good \"businessman\" manners! Forget all those lessons you learned in your uppity prep school. Rednecks have a different code! \r\n\r\n9) Reach under your suit trouser leg and scratch. Scratch under arms. Scratch hard! Do this often. \r\n\r\n10) Open a can of beer. Drink very rapidly and then belch loudly. Practice! Dribble on your business suit. Discarded silk business socks may be used to wipe mouth. Repeat. Pile the empty cans on expensive office carpet. \r\n\r\n11) Shout with laughter for no reason. \r\n\r\nNote: Do NOT be concerned if you experience concern about your dignity. Your dignity will soon disappear! Do not worry! \r\n\r\n12) Place tobacco in your mouth; place in back of cheek. Practice spitting streams of tobacco juice on to computer screen, or on polished office floor, or on important presentation, or in the cuffs of the trousers of your pinstriped suit. Brooks Brothers shoes may also serve as spittoon. \r\n\r\nNote: This is the ONLY time when you may retrieve shoes from garbage! Return to garbage can when finished! See Step #3. \r\n\r\n13) Now it is time to get rid of all those other yuppie clothes you're wearing. This will be very difficult. Until now this has been your uniform! Not anymore! For you are now a redneck! \r\n\r\n14) Untie and remove your dapper, natty silk necktie. Neckties belong to the white-collar world you are leaving! What do you need a necktie for? You're a Bubba now! You're free! Drop it in the garbage. \r\n\r\n15) Now, take off all that extra useless stuff that hotshot businessmen wear: unfasten and remove your gold monogrammed cufflinks, pluck the pocket square from your suit, unfasten your tiepin, unbutton and pull out your suspenders. Drop ALL items in garbage can. \r\n\r\n16) Slide your Rolex off your wrist. Rednecks do NOT wear wristwatches of any kind! Throw it out NOW! You will keep looking at your wrist for a while, but soon you won't care what time it is. \r\n\r\n14) Now the suit: ultimate symbol of corporate success, but also an obstacle to bubbahood! Strip off that expensive tailored Italian business suit, the crisply starched shirt and designer underwear. Toss ALL items in the garbage can. Do NOT carefully fold that suit. Just dump it in the garbage. \r\n\r\nNote: Removal of that beautiful hand-tailored business suit will be TRAUMATIC for the uppity, high and mighty upper class businessman you have been until now. It is comparable to an operation. Be prepared for a shock to your system. \r\n\r\n15) Shred all the contents of your briefcase. Add the briefcase, your cell phone, Ipod and day-timer to the garbage can. \r\n\r\n16) Cut up all business and credit cards, without exception, and throw away your wallet. \r\n\r\n17) Cut up your Ivy League and and other prestigious college degree. Also, destroy all evidence of professional accomplishments and success. You will NOT need them! \r\n\r\n18) Put on overalls. Walk around in them to get used to your new look. Take pride in your redneck identity! \r\n\r\n19) Practice poor posture and sluggish walk. Let your jaw go slack. \r\n\r\n20) Cancel subscriptions to the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. Have cable disconnected. \r\n\r\n21) If you have not already been fired, quit that high-paying prestigious white-collar job immediately and stop working altogether. Enjoy your new freedom!\r\n\r\nAlternative: become a garbage man or janitor or sling hash in a diner. \r\n\r\n22) Now prepare yourself: Those nice white businessman teeth of yours will have to go. Have you seen a redneck's teeth? Make appointment with a dentist. Have the two front top teeth removed. Chip all other teeth and stain yellow with tobacco juice. A gap toothed grin will win many friends in your new life!\r\n\r\n23) We have more news for you: Your hair has to go as well. That thick head of carefully groomed, neatly parted executive hair just won't fit with the redneck world. Just think of the joys of the redneck world that await! Make appointment with a surgeon. Have all hair on the top of your head removed through electrolysis. Let hair grow on sides and back. Have a unibrow added. All your bubba friends will envy you! \r\n\r\n24) Shave ONLY twice a week using blunt razor. Be careful to leave a scraggly beard at ALL times. That clean-shaven look you have now goes well with a boardroom \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but not for a Bubba! \r\n\r\n25) Bathe ONLY twice a week. You're used to daily showers. Forget it. \r\n\r\n26) Begin an intensive redneck language course. Do not use more than five words in a sentence. Drop all \"NG\" endings from words - \"havin\" instead of \"having\". Learn to yelp and whoop and holler. \r\n\r\n27) Sell your Porsche. No redneck drives a fancy foreign car! \r\n\r\n28) Buy a used, rusty and very old pickup. \r\n\r\n29) Sell your condo. \r\n\r\n30) Sell all of your furniture. \r\n\r\n31) Sell all of your executive sports equipment. \r\n\r\n32) Start growing a beer gut. Yes, you MUST gain weight! Do NOT exercise at all while doing this. Eat large amounts of fatty foods. Add at least 40 pounds to your stomach. Say goodbye to that dapper, trim executive image and be free! \r\n\r\n33) Buy a dilapidated shack in backwoods and shotgun rack. \r\n\r\n34) Give or throw away ALL your remaining clothes: business suits, ties, shoes, socks, shirts, and accessories, including that Burberry tuxedo and overcoat and those patent leather pumps you wore to corporate black tie events. NOTHING can be retained. The clothes of a wealthy executive will have no place in your new life! Bubbas DO NOT wear tuxedos! And that tux won't fit over your new beer gut! \r\n\r\n35) Sell your stocks, bonds and ALL OF YOUR FINANCIAL ASSSETS; give all proceeds from these and sale of car and home to a redneck charity. You will NOT need money. You are now officially below the poverty line and will remain there. \r\n\r\n36) Watch NASCAR and pro-wrestling every day. Do NOT miss any episodes. \r\n\r\n37) Find a wrecked car and leave it in front of your shack. \r\n\r\n38) Have your name changed legally from \"Mark\" or \"Andrew\" or \"Kevin\" to \"Cletus\" or \"Bubba\" or \"Jed\". \r\n\r\n39) Buy or find a hound-dog and sit with him on the porch of your shack with a gallon of whiskey.\r\n\r\n40) Now - have a photograph taken of yourself as a Bubba. Compare with earlier photograph! We are so sure you will be satisfied we will refund your money if you are not! \r\n\r\nCongratulations! You, Sir, are now the Redneck you have dreamed of becoming! \r\n\r\nSatisfaction Guaranteed! And no one will ever call you \"sir\" again!",

They showed the video surveillance tape on the news, and even the anchorman was laughing through it.\r\n\r\nA robber came into a convenience store wearing a ski mask and a gun wanting to empty the cash register. He took the clerk to the back of the store and locked her up in the fridge. Unfortunately, when he came back to the front of the store, a customer had come in. So he took *off* the ski mask and the gloves, and pretended to be filling in for the clerk. The customer wanted a lottery ticket, so he tried to help her out, pressing a whole bunch of buttons on the machine (thus leaving fingerprints everywhere), but the machine was not cooperating.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, another customer walks in. Finally, he tells the first customer (after about 5 minutes of close-up shots from the camera) that the machine is not working and that he won't be able to help her. The robber *makes the sale* to the second customer and he leaves as well.\r\n\r\nThe robber then puts back on his gloves to take the money (after touching just about everything in sight *without* gloves), and hides his face with the palm of his hands as he is leaving. This scene lasted well over 10 minutes, during which, you see and hear the robber as well as in a movie.\r\n\r\nThe day after excerpts of the tape were aired, the phones at the police station were ringing off the hook. Apparently, even though no reward had been offered, people thought he was too stupid to deserve anything else!\r\n\r\nHe had to turn himself in that same day.",

Why don't you let me take you home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay,\" slurred the very drunk woman.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Thomson stood up, she began to weave back and forth. Realizing she had had far too much to drink, the Reverend grabbed her arms to steady her. When he did, they both lost their balance and fell to the floor.\r\n\r\nAfter rolling around for a few seconds, the Reverend ended up laying on top of her, her skirt hiked up to her waist.\r\n\r\nThe bartender looked over the bar and said, \"Listen here, buddy, this isn't the place for that!\"\r\n\r\nThe Reverend looked up at the bartender and said, \"But you don't understand, I'm Pastor Fuzz.\"\r\n\r\nThe bartender nodded and said, \"Oh hell, if you're in that far, I guess you may as well finish up!\"",

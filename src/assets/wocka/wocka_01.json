In 37% of Americans, the thirst mechanism is so weak that it is often mistaken for hunger. \r\n\r\n3. Even MILD dehydration will slow down one's metabolism as much as 3%. \r\n\r\n4. One glass of water will shut down midnight hunger pangs for almost 100% of the dieters studied in a U-Washington study. \r\n\r\n5. Lack of water, the #1 trigger of daytime fatigue. \r\n\r\n6. Preliminary research indicates that 8-10 glasses of water a day could significantly ease back and joint pain for up to 80% of sufferers. \r\n\r\n7. A mere 2% drop in body water can trigger fuzzy short-term memory, trouble with basic math, and difficulty focusing on the computer screen or on a printed page. \r\n\r\n8. Drinking 5 glasses of water daily decreases the risk of colon cancer by 45%, plus it can slash the risk of breast cancer by 79%, and one is 50% less likely to develop bladder cancer. \r\n\r\nAre you drinking the amount of water you should every day? \r\n\r\nC o k e\r\n1. In many states (in the USA) the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the truck to remove blood from the highway after a car accident. \r\n\r\n2. You can put a T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two days. \r\n\r\n3. To clean a toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl and let the \"real thing\" sit for one hour, then flush clean. The citric acid in Coke removes stains from vitreous China. \r\n\r\n4.

To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke into a load of greasy clothes, add detergent, and run through a regular cycle. The Coca-Cola will help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze from your windshield. Check it out. \r\n\r\nFor Your Info :\r\n1. The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. Its pH is 2.8. It will dissolve a nail in about 4 days. Phosphoric acid also leaches calcium from bones and is a major contributor to the rising increase in osteoporosis. \r\n\r\n2. To carry Coca-Cola syrup (the concentrate) the commercial truck must use the Hazardous material place cards reserved for highly corrosive materials. \r\n\r\n3. The distributors of coke have been using it to clean the engines of their trucks for about 20 years! \r\n\r\nNow the question is, would you like a glass of water or coke?",

        "body": "I think Santa Claus is a woman... I hate to be the one to defy sacred myth, but I believe he's a she. Think about it. Christmas is a big, organized, warm, fuzzy, nurturing social deal, and I have a tough time believing a guy could possibly pull it all off! \r\nFor starters, the vast majority of men don't even think about selecting gifts until Christmas Eve. It's as if they are all frozen in some kind of ebenezerian Time Warp until 3 p.m. on Dec. 24th, when they - with amazing calm - call other errant men and plan for a last-minute shopping spree. Once at the mall, they always seem surprised to find only Ronco products, socket wrench sets, and mood rings left on the shelves. You might think this would send them into a fit of panic and guilt, but my husband tells me it's an enormous relief because it lessens the 11th hour decision-making burden. On this count alone, I'm convinced Santa is a woman. Surely, if he were a man, everyone in the universe would wake up Christmas morning to find a rotating, musical Chia Pet under the tree, still in the bag. \r\n\r\nAnother problem for a he-Santa would be getting there. First of all, there would be no reindeer because they would all be dead, gutted, and strapped onto the rear bumper of the sleigh amid wide-eyed, desperate claims that buck season had been extended. Blitzen's rack would already be on the way to the taxidermist. \r\n\r\nEven if the male Santa DID have reindeer, he'd still have transportation problems because he would inevitably get lost up there in the snow and clouds and then refuse to stop and ask for directions. Add to this the fact that there would be unavoidable delays in the chimney, where the Bob Vila-like Santa would stop to inspect and repoint bricks in the flue. He would also need to check for carbon monoxide fumes in every gas fireplace, and get under every Christmas tree that is crooked to straighten it to a perfectly upright 90-degree angle. \r\n\r\nOther reasons why Santa can't possibly be a man: \r\n\r\n* Men can't pack a bag.\r\n* Men would rather be dead than caught wearing red velvet.\r\n* Men would feel their masculinity is threatened... having to be seen with all those elves.\r\n* Men don't answer their mail.\r\n* Men would refuse to allow their physique to be described even in jest as anything remotely resembling a \"bowlful of jelly.\"\r\n* Men aren't interested in stockings unless somebody's wearing them.\r\n* Having to do the Ho Ho Ho thing would seriously inhibit their ability to pick up women.\r\n* Finally, being responsible for Christmas would require a commitment. \r\n\r\nI can buy the fact that other mythical characters are men... Father Time shows up once a year unshaven and looking ominous. Definite guy. Cupid flies around carrying weapons. Uncle Sam is a politician who likes to point fingers. Any one of these individuals could pass the testosterone-screening test. But not St. Nick. Not a chance. However, as long as we have each other, good will, peace on earth, faith and Nat King Cole's version of \"The Christmas Song,\" it probably makes little difference what gender Santa is. I just wish she'd quit dressing like a guy.",

        "body": "Tech Support  \r\n\r\nJust in case you think you are TC (technologically challenged). The following is an excerpt taken from a Wall Street Journal article:\r\n\r\n    1. Compaq is considering changing the command \"Press Any Key\" to \"Press Return Key\" because of the flood of calls asking where the \"Any\" key is.\r\n\r\n    2. AST technical support had a caller complaining that her mouse was hard to control with the dust cover on. The cover turned out to be the plastic bag the mouse was packaged in.\r\n\r\n    3. Another Compaq technician received a call from a man complaining that the system wouldn't read word processing files from his old diskettes. After trouble-shooting for magnets and heat failed to diagnose the problem, it was found that the customer had labeled the diskettes, then rolled them into the typewriter to type the labels.\r\n\r\n    4. Another AST customer was asked to send a copy of her defective diskettes. A few days later a letter arrived from the customer along with photocopies of the floppies.\r\n\r\n    5. A Dell technician advised his customer to put his troubled floppy back in the drive and close the door. The customer asked the tech to hold on, and was heard putting the phone down, getting up and crossing the room to close the door to his room.\r\n\r\n    6. Another Dell customer called to say he couldn't get his computer to fax anything. After 40 minutes of trouble-shooting, the technician discovered the man was trying to fax a piece of paper by holding it in front of the monitor screen and hitting the \"send\" key.\r\n\r\n    7. Yet another Dell customer called to complain that his keyboard no longer worked. He had cleaned it by filling up his tub with soap and water and soaking the keyboard for a day, then removing all the keys and washing them individually.\r\n\r\n    8. A Dell technician received a call from a customer who was enraged because his computer had told him he was \"bad and an invalid\". The tech explained that the computer's \"bad command\" and \"invalid\" responses shouldn't be taken personally.\r\n\r\n    9. A confused caller to IBM was having troubles printing documents. He told the technician that the computer had said it \"couldn't find printer\". The user had also tried turning the computer screen to face the printer - but that his computer still couldn't \"see\" the printer.\r\n\r\n    10. An exasperated caller to Dell Computer Tech Support couldn't get her new Dell Computer to turn on. After ensuring the computer was plugged in, the technician asked her what happened when she pushed the power button. Her response, \"I pushed and pushed on this foot pedal and nothing happens.\" The \"foot pedal\" turned out to be the computer's mouse.\r\n\r\n    11. Another customer called Compaq tech support to say her brand-new computer wouldn't  work. She said she unpacked the unit, plugged it in and sat there for 20 minutes waiting for something to happen. When asked what happened when she pressed the power switch, she asked \"What power switch?\"\r\n\r\n    12. True story from a Novell NetWire SysOp:\r\n\r\nCaller: \"Hello, is this Tech Support?\"\r\nTech: \"Yes, it is. How may I help you?\"\r\nCaller: \"The cup holder on my PC is broken and I am within my warranty period. How do I go about getting that fixed?\"\r\nTech: \"I'm sorry, but did you say a cup holder?\"\r\nCaller: \"Yes, it's attached to the front of my computer.\"\r\nTech: \"Please excuse me if I seem a bit stumped, It's because I am. Did you receive this as part of a promotional, at a trade show? How did you get this cup holder? Does it   have any trademark on it?\"\r\nCaller: \"It came with my computer, I don't know anything about a promotional. It just has '4X' on it.\" At this point the Tech Rep had to mute the caller, because he couldn't stand it. He was laughing too hard. The caller had been using the load drawer of the CD-ROM drive as a cup holder, and snapped it off the drive!\r\n\r\n    13. Another IBM customer had troubles installing software and rang for support. \"I put in the first disk, and that was OK. It said to put in the second disk, and had some problems with the disk. When it said to put in the third disk - I couldn't even fit it in...\" The user hadn't realized that \"Insert Disk 2\" meant to remove Disk 1 first.\r\n\r\n    14. In a similar incident, a customer had followed the instructions for installing software. The instructions said to remove the disk from it's cover and insert into the drive. The user had physically removed the casing of the disk and wondered why there were problems.\r\n\r\n    As Ripley would say, believe it or not!",

I was watching our new system administrator trying to restore it. He inserted a CD and needed to type a path name to a directory named \"i386.\" \r\nHe started to type it and paused, asking me, \"Where's the key for that line thing?\" \r\nI asked what he was talking about, and he said, \"You know, that one that looks like an upside-down exclamation mark.\" \r\nI replied, \"You mean the letter 'i'?\" \r\nAnd he said, \"Yeah, that's it!\" \r\n\r\nI was in a car dealership a while ago when a large motor home was towed into the garage. The front of the vehicle was in dire need of repair and the whole thing generally looked like it had been an extra in \"Twister.\" I asked the manager what had happened. He told me that the driver had set the cruise control, and then went in back to make a sandwich.",

There was a guy inventing a shark bite suit; and there's only one way to test it. \"Alright Jimmy, you got that shark suit on, it looks good... They want you to jump into this pool of sharks, and you tell us if it hurts when they bite you.\" \"Well, all right, but hold my sign. I don't wanna lose it.\"\r\n\r\n    Last time I had a flat tire, I pulled my truck into one of those side-of-the-road gas stations. The attendant walks out, looks at my truck, looks at me, and I SWEAR he said, \"Tire go flat?\" I couldn't resist. Said, \"Nope. I was driving around and those other three just swelled right up on me. Here's your sign.\"\r\n\r\n    We were trying to sell our car about a year ago. A guy came over to the house and drove the car around for about 45 minutes. We get back to the house, he gets out of the car, reaches down and grabs the exhaust pipe, then says, \"Darn that's hot!\" See? If he'd been wearing his sign, I could have stopped him.\r\n\r\n    I learned to drive an 18 wheeler in my days of adventure. Wouldn't ya know I misjudged the height of a bridge. The truck got stuck and I couldn't get it out no matter how I tried. I radioed in for help and eventually a local cop shows up to take the report. He went through his basic questioning ok, no problem. I thought sure he was clear of needing a sign until he asked \"So..is your truck stuck?\" I couldn't help myself! I looked at him, looked back at the rig and then back to him and said \"No, I'm delivering a bridge... here's your sign.\"",

He has been around forever, so I wouldn't put it past him to come up with something like this. \r\nAnyway, one year there were these two guys who were taking Chemistry and who did pretty well on all of the quizzes and the mid-terms and labs, etc., such that going into the final they had a solid A. These friends were so confident going into the final that the weekend before finals week (even though the Chem final was on Monday), they decided to go up to U Virginia and party with some friends up there. \r\n\r\nThey did this and had a great time. However, with their hangovers and everything, they overslept all day Sunday and didn't make it back to Duke until early Monday morning. Rather than taking the final then, they found Professor Bonk after the final and explained to him why they missed the final. They told him that they went up to UVA for the weekend, and had planned to come back in time to study, but that they had a flat tire on the way back and didn't have a spare and couldn't get help for a long time and so were late getting back to campus. \r\n\r\nBonk thought this over and then agreed that they could make up the final on the following day.

When it became apparent that she and her boyfriend would marry she thought to herself, \"He is such a sweet and gentle man but I don't think he can live with my problems.\" So she decided to make the supreme sacrifice and give up beans. \r\nA year later her car broke down on the way home from work. Since she lived in the country, she called her husband and told him she would be late because she had to walk home. On her way, she passed a small diner and the odor of the baked beans was more than she could stand. Since she still had miles to walk, she figured that she could walk off any ill effect by the time she reached home. So she stopped at the diner, and before she knew it she had consumed three large orders of baked beans. All the way home she putt-putted. \r\n\r\nUpon arriving home she felt reasonably sure she could control it. Her husband seemed excited to see her, exclaming delightedly, \"Darling, I have a surprise for dinner tonight.\" He then blindfolded her then led her to a chair at the table.

He made her promise not to touch the blindfold till he came back, then he went to answer the phone. \r\n\r\nThe baked beans she had consumed were still affecting her and the pressure was becoming almost unbearable, so while her husband was out of the room she seized the opportunity, shifted the weight to one leg, and let it go. It was not only loud, but it smelt like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk coming from a pulp mill. She took a napkin and fanned the air around her vigorously. Then she shifted to the other cheek and ripped three more, which reminded her of cabbage cooking. Keeping her ears turned to the conversation in the other room, she went on like this for another ten minutes. When the phone farewells signed the end of her freedom, she fanned the air a few more times with the napkin, placed it on her lap and folded her hands upon it, smiling contentedly to herself, she was the picture of innocence when her husband returned. Apologizing for taking so long, he asked her if she peeked and she assured him that she had not. At this point, he removes the blindfold to reveal twelve dinner guests seated around the table to wish her a first Happy Anniversary!",

For all of you who occasionally have a really bad day when you just need to take it out on someone: Don't take that bad day out on someone you know, take it out on someone you *don't* know! Now get this. \r\nI was sitting at my desk, when I remembered a phone call I had to make. I found the number and dialed it.\r\n\r\nA man answered nicely saying, \"Hello?\"\r\n\r\nI politely said, \"This is Patrick Hanifin and could I please speak to Robin Carter?\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly the phone was slammed down on me! I couldn't believe that anyone could be that rude. I tracked down Robin's correct number and called her. She had written the last two digits incorrectly. After I hung up with Robin, I spotted the wrong number still lying there on my desk. I decided to call it again.\r\n\r\nWhen the same person once more answered, I yelled, \"You're a jackass!\" and hung up.\r\n\r\nNext to his phone number I wrote the word \"jackass,\" and put it in my desk drawer.\r\n\r\nEvery couple of weeks, when I was paying bills, or had a really bad day, I'd call him up.\r\n\r\nHe'd answer, and I'd yell, \"You're a jackass!\"\r\n\r\nIt would always cheer me up.\r\n\r\nLater in the year the Phone Company introduced caller ID. This was a real disappointment for me, I would have to stop calling the jackass.\r\n\r\nThen one day I had an idea.\r\n\r\nI dialed his number, then heard his voice say, \"Hello,\" I made up a name. \"Hi. This is the sales office of the Telephone Company and I'm just calling to see if you're familiar with our caller ID program?\"\r\n\r\nHe went, \"No!\" and slammed the phone down.\r\n\r\nI quickly called him back and said, \"That's because you're a jackass!\"\r\n\r\nThe reason I took the time to tell you this story, is to show you how if there's ever anything really bothering you, you can do something about it. Just dial 823-4863.\r\n\r\nThe old lady at the mall really took her time pulling out of the parking space. I didn't think she was ever going to leave.\r\nFinally, her car began to move and she started to very slowly back out of the slot. I backed up a little more to give her plenty of room to pull out. \"Great,\" I thought, \"she's finally leaving.\" All of a sudden this black Camaro comes flying up the parking aisle in the wrong direction and pulls into her space.\r\n\r\nI started honking my horn and yelling, \"You can't just do that, Buddy. I was here first!\" The guy climbed out of his Camaro completely ignoring me. He walked toward the mall as if he didn't even hear me. I thought to myself, \"This guy's a jackass.\r\nThere sure a lot of jackasses in this world.\"\r\n\r\nI noticed he had a \"For Sale\" sign in the back window of his car. I wrote down the number, then I hunted for another place to park.\r\n\r\nA couple of days later, I'm at home sitting at my desk. I had just gotten off the phone after calling 823-4863 and yelling, \"You're a jackass!\" (It's really easy to call him now since I have his number on speed dial.) I noticed the phone number of the guy with the black Camaro lying on my desk and thought I'd better call this guy, too.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple rings someone answered the phone and said, \"Hello.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"Is this the man with the black Camaro for sale?\" \r\n\"Yes, it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell me where I can see it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I live at 1802 West 34th street. It's a yellow house and the car's parked right out front.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"What's your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Don Hansen.\"\r\n\r\n\"When's a good time to catch you, Don?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm home in the evenings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen Don, can I tell you something?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don, you're a jackass!\" and I slammed the phone down.\r\n\r\nAfter I hung up I added Don Hansen's number to my speed dialer. For a while things seemed to be going better for me. Now when I had a problem I had two jackasses to call. Then, after several months of calling the jackasses and hanging up on them, it just wasn't as enjoyable as it used to be. I gave the problem some serious thought and came up with a solution:\r\n\r\nFirst, I had my phone dial Jackass #1.\r\nA man answered nicely saying, \"Hello.\" \r\n\r\nI yelled \"You're a jackass!\" but I didn't hang up.\r\n\r\nThe jackass said, \"Are you still there?\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"Yeah.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Stop calling me.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"No.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"What's you name, pal?\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"Don Hansen.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Where do you live?\"\r\n\r\n\"1802 West 34th Street. It's a yellow house and my black Camaro's parked out front.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm coming over right now, Don. You'd better start saying your prayers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, like I'm really scared, Jackass!\" and I hung up.\r\n\r\nThen I called Jackass #2. He answered, \"Hello.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"Hello, Jackass!\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"If I ever find out who you are...\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll kick your butt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, here's your chance. I'm coming over right now, Jackass!\" And I hung up.\r\n\r\nThen I picked up the phone and called the police. I told them I was at 1802 West 34th Street and that I was going to kill my gay lover as soon as he got home.\r\n\r\nAnother quick call to Channel 13 about the gang war going on down W. 34th Street.\r\n\r\nAfter that, I climbed into my car and headed over to 34th Street to watch the whole thing. Glorious watching two Jackasses kicking the crap out of each other in front of six squad cars and a police helicopter was one of the greatest experiences of my life!\r\n\r\nName withheld to protect the guilty.",

        "body": "Proof That Santa Doesn't Exist - For Nerds!  \r\n\r\nThere are approximately two billion children (persons under 18) in the world. However, since Santa does not visit children of Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, or Buddhist (except maybe in Japan) religions, this reduces the workload for Christmas night to 15% of the total, or 378 million (according to the population reference bureau). At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that comes to 108 million homes, presuming there is at least one good child in each. \r\nSanta has about 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 967.7 visits per second. This is to say that for each Christian household with a good child, Santa has around 1/1000th of a second to park the sleigh, hop out, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left for him, get back up the chimney, jump into the sleigh and get onto the next house. \r\n\r\nAssuming that each of these 108 million stops is evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false, but will accept for the purposes of our calculations), we are not talking about 0.78 miles per household; a total trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting bathroom stops or breaks. \r\n\r\nThis means Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second - 3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man made vehicle, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a pokey 27.4 miles per second, and a conventional reindeer can run (at best) 15 miles per hour. The payload of the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium sized LEGO set (two pounds), the sleigh is carrying over 500 thousand tons, not counting Santa himself. On land, a conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that flying reindeer can pull 10 times the normal amount, the job can't be done with eight or even nine of them -Santa would need 360,000 of them. This increases the payload, not counting the weight of the sleigh, another 54,000 tons, or roughly seven times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth (the ship, not the monarch). \r\n\r\nA mass of nearly 600,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance - this would heat up the reindeer in the same fashion as a spacecraft re-entering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer would absorb 14.3 quintillion joules of energy per second each. In short, they would burst into flames almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them and creating deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team would be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second, or right about the time Santa reaches the fifth house on his trip. Not that it matters, however, since Santa, as a result of accelerating from a dead stop to 650 m.p.s. in .001 seconds, would be subjected to acceleration forces of 17,000 g's. \r\n\r\nA 250 pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim considering all the high calorie snacks he must have consumed over the years) would be pinned to the back of the sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force, instantly crushing his bones and organs and reducing him to a quivering blob of pink goo. Therefore, if Santa did exist, he's dead now. MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!",

        "body": "At the 1994 annual awards dinner given for Forensic Science, AAFS president Dr. Don Harper Mills astounded his audience with the legal complications of a bizarre death. Here is the story: \r\nOn March 23, 1994, the medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound to the head. The decedent had jumped from the top of a ten-story building intending to commit suicide. \r\n\r\nHe left a note to that effect, indicating his despondency. As he fell past the ninth floor, his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast passing through a window, which killed him instantly. Neither the shooter nor the decedent was aware that a safety net had been installed just below at the eighth floor level to protect some building workers and that Ronald Opus would not have been able to complete his suicide the way he had planned. \r\n\r\nOrdinarily, Dr. Mills continued, \"a person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds, even though the mechanism might not be what he intended\", is still defined as committing suicide. Mr. Opus was shot on the way to certain death nine stories below at street level, but his suicide attempt probably would not have been successful because of the safety net. This caused the medical examiner to feel that he had a homicide on his hands. \r\n\r\nThe room on the ninth floor from whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife. They were arguing vigorously, and he was threatening her with a shotgun. The man was so upset that when he pulled the trigger he completely missed his wife and the pellets went through the window striking Mr. Opus. \r\n\r\nWhen one intends to kill subject A, but kills subject B in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B. When confronted with the murder charge, the old man and his wife were both adamant. They both said they thought the shotgun was unloaded. The old man said it was his long standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun. He had no intention to murder her, therefore the killing of Mr. Opus appeared to be an accident; that is, the gun had been accidentally loaded. \r\n\r\nThe continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's son loading the shotgun about six weeks prior to the fatal accident. It transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial support and the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother. \r\n\r\nThe case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of Ronald Opus. \r\n\r\nNow comes the exquisite twist; further investigation revealed that the son was in fact Ronald Opus. He had become increasingly despondent over both the loss of his financial support and the failure of his attempt to engineer his mother's murder. This led him to jump off the ten-story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by a shotgun blast passing through the ninth-story window. The son had actually murdered himself, so the medical examiner closed the case as a suicide.",

He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes -- conned by those who buttered him up. \r\n\r\nStill, even as a crusty old man, he was a roll model for millions. Fresh is survived by his second wife. They have two children and another bun in the oven. The funeral was held at 350 for about 20 minutes.",

We also advise outdoorsmen to carry pepper spray with them in case of an encounter with a bear. It is also a good idea to watch out for fresh signs of bear activity.

For two years, he has wanted to ask a certain girl (who is also from Westchester and also goes to Ithaca) out on a date, but has never had the courage. \r\nFinally, one day over the summer, he sees her at home and musters up the courage to ask her out. She accepts, and they make dinner plans for Saturday night. Friday night, this guy goes out with all of his buddies, and drinks like Prohibition is coming back. Saturday, he is in such bad shape that he can't make it through twenty minutes without either puking or shitting. \r\n\r\nAfter several hours of this, he is able to stop puking, but he is still running to the toilet every 20 minutes to shit. He doesn't want to cancel the date, because he's afraid he won't ever talk to her again. So they meet in Westchester, and take the train to New York City (about a 30 minute ride). \r\n\r\nThey get to the restaurant, and he excuses himself during the appetizers to use the bathroom. They enjoy the rest of the appetizers without interruption, but he has to go back again during the entrees. They decide to get dessert. During dessert, our hero feels another rumbling, but doesn't want to look like a complete bathroom freak, so he holds it. After a few minutes, the rumbling subsides, but he still has a bit of gas stored up. He decides to let this little bit of gas fly right there at the table (discreetly, of course). \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this little bit of gas came with another little surprise. 'Oh shit,' he thinks (and feels). Instead of running to the bathroom right away, our hero immediately leans on the arms of his chair to keep from sitting on this surprise. He maintains this yoga position for the rest of dessert, trying to figure out what to do before his tan pants (a) start to smell, or (b) start to show stains on the outside. He quickly pays for dinner and they leave the restaurant. Oh, by the way, he is walking like a cowboy. \r\n\r\nOn the way to the train station, they pass the Gap. 'Do you mind if I run in and buy a sweater that I was looking at last week?' he asks. 'No problem, I'd like to look around too,' she replies. They go into the Gap. Fortunately, at the Gap, men's fashions are on the right, women's fashions are on the left. They split up. \r\n\r\nOur hero grabs the first sweater within reach, and hurries back to the khakis. After selecting a pair that most closely resemble his current outfit, he brings both items to the register. His eyes are on his date (still on the other side of the store) to make sure that she doesn't see him buying the pants. He doesn't even want the sweater, so he says through clenched teeth (just in case his date can read lips from 40 feet away) 'Just the pants.' 'What?' asks the Gap girl. 'Just the pants!' (Eyes still trained on his date.) Gap girl: 'Oh, OK.' He pays for the pants and walks over to his date, then they leave the store. \r\n\r\nThey board the train just before it leaves the station and find two seats in the middle of the car. Without sitting down, our hero excuses himself and walks to the bathroom in the back of the car. He gets to the bathroom as the train departs, and quickly rips off his pants and boxer shorts. He rolls them into a ball and throws them out the window. After cleaning himself off, he opens the Gap bag and pulls out...just the sweater.",

Someone who had committed adultery would say instead that they had 'fallen.' \r\n\r\nThis seemed to satisfy the old priest and things went well until the priest passed away at a ripe old age. \r\n\r\nA few days after the new priest arrived, he visited the mayor of the town and seemed very concerned. \r\n\r\n\"Mayor, you have to do something about the sidewalks in town. When people come into the confessional, they keep telling me they've fallen.\" \r\n\r\nThe mayor started to laugh, realizing that no one had told the new priest about the code word. But, before he could explain, the priest shook an accusing finger at him and shouted, \"I don't know what you're laughing about, because your wife has fallen three times this week!\"",

Your dad read in the paper that most accidents happen within twenty miles of home, so we moved. Won't be able to send you the address as the last Arkansas family that lived here took the numbers with them for their house, so they wouldn't have to change their address.\r\n\r\n    This place has a washing machine.  The first day I put four shirts in it, pulled the chain and haven't seen 'em since.\r\n\r\n    It only rained twice this week, three days the first time and four days the second time.\r\n\r\n    The coat you wanted me to send to you, Aunt Sue said it would be a little too heavy to send in the mail with them heavy buttons, so we cut them off and put them in the pockets.\r\n\r\n    We got a bill from the funeral home, and it said if we didn't make the final payment on Grandma's funeral bill, up she comes.\r\n\r\n    About your sister, she had a baby this morning.  I haven't found out whether if it is a boy or a girl so don't know if you are an Aunt or Uncle.\r\n\r\n    Your Uncle John fell in the whiskey vat.  Some men tried to get him out, but he fought them off playfully, so he drowned.  We cremated him and he burned for three days.\r\n\r\n    Three of your friends went off the bridge in a pickup.  One was driving and the other two were in the back.  The driver got out.  He rolled down the window and swam to safety.  The other 2 drowned.  They couldn't get the tail gate down.\r\n\r\n    Not much more news this time.  Nothing much happened.  If you don't get this letter, please let me know and I will send another one.\r\n\r\nLove, Ma",

Or a year's worth of free Mobile gasoline.\"\r\n\r\nThough it does not officially begin until Jan. 1, 1997, the airbag promotion is already being tested in select cities, with feedback overwhelmingly positive. \"As soon as my car started to skid out of control, I thought to myself, 'Oh, boy, this could be it--I could be a big winner!'\" said Cincinnati's Martin Frelks, who lost his wife but won $50 Sunday when the Buick LeSabre they were driving hit an oil slick at 60 mph and slammed into an oncoming truck.\r\n\r\n\"When the car stopped rolling down the embankment, I knew Ellen was dead, but all I could think about was getting the blood and glass out of my eyes so I could read that airbag!\" \r\n\r\n\"It's really addictive,\" said Sacramento, CA, resident Marjorie Kamp, speaking from her hospital bed, where she is listed in critical condition with severe brain hemorrhaging and a punctured right lung.\r\n\r\n\"I've already crashed four cars trying to win those Super Bowl tickets, but I still haven't won. I swear, I'm going to win those tickets--even if it kills me!\" Kamp said that as soon as she is well enough, she plans to buy a new Pontiac Bonneville and drive it into a tree.\r\n\r\nGM officials are not surprised the airbag contest has been so well received. \"In the past, nobody really liked car wrecks, and that's understandable. After all, they're scary and dangerous and, sometimes, even fatal,\" GM CEO Paul Offerman said. \"But now, when you drive a new GM car or truck, your next serious crash could mean serious cash.\r\n\r\n\"Who wouldn't like that?\" Offerman added that in the event a motorist wins a prize but is killed, that prize will be awarded to the next of kin. According to GM's official contest rules, odds of winning the grand prize, a brand-new 1997 Cutlass Supreme, are 1 in 43,000,000.\r\n\r\nStatistical experts, however, say the real chances of winning are significantly worse. \"If you factor in the odds of getting in a serious car accident in the first place--approximately 1 in 720,000--the actual odds of winning a prize each time you step in your car are more like 1 in 31 trillion.\"\r\n\r\nFurther, even if one is in an accident, there is no guarantee the airbag will inflate. \"I was recently broadsided by a drunk driver in my new Chevy Cavalier,\" said Erie, PA, resident Jerry Polaner. \"My car was totaled, and because it was the side of my car that got hit, my airbag didn't even inflate. But what really gets me is the fact that the drunk driver, who rammed my side with the front of his 1997 Buick Regal, won a $100 Office Depot gift certificate. That's just wrong.\"",

Support your answer with a proof.\" Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant thereof. \r\n\r\nOne student, however, wrote the following: \r\n\r\nFirst, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So, we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since, there are more than one of these religions, and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to Hell. \r\n\r\nWith birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell, because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added. \r\n\r\nThis gives two possibilities: \r\n\r\n1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose. \r\n2. Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over. \r\n\r\nSo which is it? \r\n\r\nIf we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Krissy Jones during my Freshman year that \"it will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep with you\" and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then (2) cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic. \r\n\r\nThis student got the only A.",

The man swills down the drink and says, \"Gimme another one.\" \r\n\r\nThe bartender pours the drink but says, \"Now, before I give you this, why don't you let off a little steam and tell me why you're so upset?\" \r\n\r\nThe man begins his tale. \"Well, I was sitting in the bar next-door, when this gorgeous blonde slinks in and actually sits beside me. I thought, 'Wow, this has never happened before.' You know, it was kind of a fantasy come true. Well, a couple of minutes later, I feel this hand moving around in my lap and the blonde leans over, licks my ear, and asks if I'm interested. I couldn't believe this was happening. I managed to nod my head yes, so she grabs my hand and starts walking out of the bar. So, of course, I went with her. This was just too good to be true.\" \r\n\r\nHe continues, \"She took me down the street to a nice hotel and up to her room. As soon as she shut the door, she slipped out of her dress. That was all she was wearing! I tell you, it didn't take me much longer to get out of my clothes. But as soon as I jumped into the bed, I heard some keys jingling and someone starts fumbling with the door.\" \r\n\r\nThe blonde says, 'Oh, my god, it's my boyfriend. He must have lost his wrestling match tonight. He's gonna be real mad. Quick, hide!' \r\n\r\nI opened the closet, but I figured that was probably the first place he would look, so I didn't hide there. Then I looked under the bed, but I figured that he's bound to look there, too. By now, I could hear the key in the lock. I noticed the window was open, so I climbed out and was hanging there by my fingers, praying that the guy wouldn't see me...\" \r\n\r\nThe bartender says, \"Well, I can see how you might be a bit frustrated at this point.\" \r\n\r\n\"Well, yeah, but I hear the guy finally get the door open, and he yells, 'Who you been sleeping with now, witch?' \r\n\r\nThe girl says, 'Nobody, honey, now come to bed and calm down.' \r\n\r\nWell, the guy starts tearing up the room. I hear him tear the door off the closet and throw it across the room. I'm thinking, 'Boy, I'm glad I didn't hide in there.' Then I hear him lift up the bed and throw it across the room. Good thing I didn't hide under there either. Then I heard him say, 'What's that over there by the window?' \r\n\r\nI think, 'Oh God, I'm dead meat now.' \r\n\r\nBut by now the blonde is trying real hard to distract him and convince him to stop looking. Well, I hear the guy go into the bathroom, and I hear water running for a long time. I figure maybe he's gonna take a bath or something, when all of a sudden, the jerk pours a pitcher of scalding hot water out of the window right on top of my head. I mean, look at this, I got second degree burns all over my scalp and shoulders!\" \r\n\r\nThe bartender says, \"Oh man, that would have pissed me off for sure.\" \r\n\r\n\"No, that didn't really bother me. Next, the guy starts slamming the window shut over and over on my hands. I mean, look at my fingers. They're a bloody mess.

Again she tried to make the step onto the bus only to discover she still couldn't! \r\n\r\nSo, a little more embarrassed she once again reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, much to her chagrin she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. So, with a coy little smile to the driver she again unzipped the offending skirt to give little more slack and again was unable to make the step. \r\n\r\nAbout this time the big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. \r\n\r\nWell, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero, screeching at him, \"How dare you touch my body!! I don't even know who you are!\" \r\n\r\nAt this the Texan drawled \"Well ma'am normally I would agree with you but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends.\"",

When he tries to open it, he finds it is locked. Puzzled and curious, he calls his new bride up to the attic and asks her about the trunk. \r\n\r\nShe tells him that it is hers and that it only contains some personal things. He accepts her answer and eventually forgets all about the matter. \r\n\r\nThree years later when he is cleaning out the attic, he runs across the trunk and again asks his wife what's in it. She again tells him that it contains only personal things, but this time he is more persistent. So she sits him down and reminds him that she makes him happy when he's feeling down, that she keeps the house meticulously clean, that she \r\ncooks him fantastic meals 7 days a week, and that she gives him all the sex he wants, anytime he wants it. Then she tells him if he is happy with all of those things, that he should forget about the trunk because she will not talk about it. \"Fair enough,\" says the husband, and he finishes cleaning out the attic. \r\n\r\nOn their 25th wedding anniversary, he pulls the trunk down the stairs, into the middle of the living room floor, and calls to his wife. \"Honey,\" he says, \"we've been married for 25 years and I think it's time we had a heart-to-heart talk. What the hell is in that trunk?\" The wife immediately protests, reminding him once again about the clean house, the good food and the great sex. \"I don't care,\" he tells her. \"After 25 years we ought to be able to talk about anything. Now open this goddamn trunk!\" \r\n\r\nSo, she takes a key from a chain hanging around her neck and opens the trunk. Inside is three ears of corn and 25 thousand dollars in cash. \r\n\r\n\"Jesus Christ!\" shouts the surprised husband. \"What's going on here? Where did all of this come from?\" \r\n\r\n\"Well, sweetie,\" replies the wife, \"you said we could talk, so I'll tell you what you want to know. Over the years, I tried to stay faithful to you, but I wasn't always successful. Every time that I cheated on you, I put an ear of corn into the trunk.\" \r\n\r\nThe husband cannot believe the shocking confession that he has just heard, but after mulling it over in his mind for a few moments he says to his wife, \"All right, I admit I'm not too thrilled about this, but I did say we should be honest with each other, and I guess I can live with three incidents of infidelity in 25 years. But where did all the money come from?\" \r\n\r\n\"Well,\" she replies, \"whenever the trunk got full, I sold the corn.\"",

For almost a week, he made a complete nuisance of himself, irritating both staff and the other patients, demanding attention and expecting his every order to be followed immediately. He was in a six-man ward rather than a private room, his meals were too cold or not served to suit his taste, the light needed to be adjusted to his demands, the nighttime activities interfered with his rest, and so on. \r\n\r\nOne afternoon, an orderly entered the room. \r\n\r\n\"Time to take your temperature, General,\" the orderly said. \r\n\r\nAfter growling at the orderly, the general opened his mouth to accept the thermometer. \"Sorry, General, but for this test we need your temperature from the other end,\" the orderly told him. A whole new barrage of verbal abuse followed, but the orderly was insistent that a rectal temperature was what the test called for. The general at last rolled over, bared his rear, and allowed the orderly to proceed. \r\n\r\nThe orderly then told the general, \"Stay exactly like that and don't move. I'll be back in five minutes to check up on you,\" and withdrew. \r\n\r\nAn hour later, the head nurse entered the room, saw the general with his bare rear in the air and gasped, \"What's going on here?\" \r\n\r\n\"Haven't you ever seen someone having their temperature taken?\" the general barked. \r\n\r\n\"Yes I have, General, but with a daffodil?\"",

But if we explore it's paradoxes, we find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig.\r\n\r\nAnd why is it that writers write but fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce, and hammers don't ham? If the plural of\r\ntooth is teeth, why isn't the plural of booth beeth? One goose, 2 geese. So one moose, 2 meese? One index, 2 indices?\r\n\r\nDoesn't it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend, that you comb through annals of history but not a\r\nsingle annal? If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them, what do you call it?\r\n\r\nIf teachers taught, why didn't preachers praught? If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat? If you wrote a letter, perhaps you bote your tongue?\r\n\r\nSometimes I think all the English speakers should be committed to an asylum for the verbally insane. In what\r\nlanguage do people recite at a play and play at a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo by ship? Have noses that run\r\nand feet that smell?

One of them immediately comes out with the comment \"Go to a basketball game, ya wouldn't find Nuns there now would ya!?\". \r\n\r\nA little while on, the other of the two comments \"Go to a football game, ya wouldn't find Nuns there now would ya!?\". \r\n\r\nAgain, not more than five minutes later, the first one mentions \"Go to a Ice Hockey game, you wouldn't find Nuns there now would ya!?\". \r\n\r\nWell that was obviously the breaking point and immediately one of the Nuns turned to the two men, bellowing \"Go to hell!

For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.\r\n  \r\n   2. Every time they repainted the lines on the road, you would have to buy a new car.\r\n  \r\n   3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You would have to pull over to the side of the road, close all of the windows, shut\r\noff the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue.\r\nFor some reason you would simply accept this.\r\n  \r\n   4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn, would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall the engine.\r\n  \r\n   5. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable, five times as fast and twice as easy to drive-but would run on only five percent of the roads.\r\n  \r\n   6. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would all be replaced by a single \"This Car Has Performed An Illegal Operation\" warning light.\r\n  \r\n   7.

You see, we've never had a Human Resources Director make it this far and we're not really sure what to do with you.\"\r\n\"No problem, just let me in,\" said the woman.\r\n\"Well, I'd like to, but I have higher orders. What we are going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an Eternity in.\"\r\n\"Actually, I think I've made up my mind. I prefer to stay in Heaven,\" said the HR Director. \r\n\"Sorry, we have rules.\"\r\nAnd with that St. Peter put the HR executive in a lift and down it went to Hell. The doors opened and she found herself stepping onto the putting green of a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club and standing in front of her were all friends and fellow executives she had worked with and they were all cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks and talked about old times. They played an excellent round of golf and at night went to the country club where she enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil who was actually a really nice guy. She had a great time telling jokes and dancing. Everybody shook her hand and waved good-bye as she got in the lift. The elevator opened at the Pearly Gates and she found St. Peter waiting for her. \r\nShe spent the next 24 hours lounging around on the clouds and playing the harp and singing. She had a great time and before she knew it her 24 hours were up and St. Peter came and got her.\r\n\"So you have spent a day in hell, and a day in Heaven. Now choose your eternity,\" he said.\r\nThe woman replied: \"Well I never thought I would say this. I mean, Heaven has been really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell.\"\r\nSo St. Peter escorted her to the lift and again she went back to Hell. When the doors opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in rubbish and filth. She saw her friends were dressed in rags and were picking up the rubbish and putting it in sacks. The Devil came up to her and put his arm around her.\r\n\"I don't understand,\" stammered the HR Director. \"Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and a country club and we ate steak and lobster and we danced and had a great time. Now all there is are wastelands and rubbish and all my friends look miserable.\"\r\nThe Devil looked at her and smiled. \"Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you're staff.\"",

Coors put its slogan, \"Turn it loose,\" into Spanish,\r\nwhere it was read  as \"Suffer from diarrhea\".\r\n\r\n2. Clairol introduced the \"Mist Stick\", a curling iron,\r\ninto German only  to find out that \"mist\" is slang for\r\nmanure. Not too many people had a  use for\r\nthe \"manure stick\".\r\n\r\n3. An American T-shirt maker in Miami printed shirts for the Spanish  market which promoted the Pope's visit. Instead of \"I saw the Pope\"  (el Papa), the shirts read \"I saw the potato\" (la papa).\r\n\r\n4. Pepsi's \"Come alive with the Pepsi Generation\"\r\ntranslated into \"Pepsi  brings your ancestors back from the grave\", in Chinese.\r\n\r\n5. When Gerber started selling baby food in Africa, they used the same  packaging as in the US, with the beautiful Caucasian baby on the  label. Later they learned that in Africa, companies routinely put  pictures on the label of what's inside, since most people can't read.\r\n\r\n6. Frank Perdue's chicken slogan, \"it takes a strong man to make a tender  chicken\" was translated into Spanish as \"it takes an aroused man to  make a chicken affectionate\".\r\n\r\n7. The Coca-Cola name in China was first read as\r\n\"Ke-kou-ke-la\", meaning  \"Bite the wax tadpole\" or \"female horse stuffed with wax\", depending  on the dialect. Coke then researched 40,000 characters to find a  phonetic equivalent \"ko-kou-ko-le\", translating into \"happiness in the  mouth\".\r\n\r\n8. When Parker Pen marketed a ball-point pen in Mexico, its ads were  supposed to have read, \"it won't leak in your pocket and embarrass  you\". Instead, the company thought that the word  \"embarazar\" (to  impregnate) meant to\r\nembarrass, so the ad read: \"It won't leak in your  pocket and make you pregnant\". OOPS!",

You go to zee store. You buy potato. You put potato in sweeming suit and walk up and down zee beach. You will meet girl very, very qweekly zees way.\"\r\n\"Thanks!\" says the guy, and runs off to the store. He buys the potato, puts it in the swimsuit, and marches up and down the beach. Up and down, up and down he walks, but the women will hardly even look at him. After half an hour he can't take it any more and goes back to the Frenchman.\r\n\"Look,\" he says, \"I got the suit, I put the potato in it, and I walked up and down the beach-- and still nothing!

In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5, but installed undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0. and now Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail. What can I do? \r\nDesperate \r\n******************************************** \r\nDear Desperate: \r\nFirst keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package,while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Try to enter the command: C:/I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME and download Tears 6.2 to install Guilt 3.0. If all works as designed, Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Jewellery 2.0 and Flowers 3.5. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will create Snoring Loudly. WAV files. Whatever you do, DO NOT install Mother-in-law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend program. \r\nThese are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0. \r\nIn summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider buying additional software to improve memory and performance. I personally recommend Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 7.7. \r\nGood Luck, \r\nTech Support.",

Maximum. \r\n\r\nComplaining about the brand of free beer in a buddy's fridge is forbidden. Gripe at will if the temperature is unsuitable. \r\n\r\nNo man shall ever be required to buy a birthday present for another man. (in fact, even remembering your buddy's birthday is strictly optional). \r\n\r\nWhen stumbling upon other guys watching a sporting event, you may always ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never ask who's playing. \r\n\r\nIt is permissible to quaff a fruity chick drink only when you're sunning on a tropical beach....and it's delivered by a topless supermodel...and it's free. \r\n\r\nUnless you're in prison, never fight naked. \r\n\r\nFriends don't let friends wear Speedos. Ever. Issue closed. \r\n\r\nIf a man's zipper is down, that's his problem---you didn't see nothin'. \r\n\r\nWomen who claim they \"love to watch sports\" must be treated as spies until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the ability to pick a buffalo wing clean. \r\n\r\nYou must offer heartfelt and public condolences over the death of a girlfriend's cat, even if it was you who secretly set it on fire and threw it into a ceiling fan. \r\n\r\nNever join your girlfriend or wife in dissing a buddy of yours, except if she's withholding sex pending your response. \r\n\r\nNever talk to a man in a bathroom unless you are on equal footing: both urinating, both waiting in line, etc. For all other situations, an almost imperceptible nod is all the conversation you need. \r\n\r\nYou cannot rat out a coworker who shows up at work with a massive hangover. You may however, hide the aspirin, smear his chair with limburger cheese, turn the brightness dial all the way down so he thinks his monitor is broken, and have him paged over the loudspeaker every seven minutes. \r\n\r\nFinally...Always split aces and eights.

The driver loads the camel onto the mechanics 'pit' and proceeds down underneath to look at the underside of the camel. \"Yep, I can see what the problem is there I'll have your camel started in no time matey.  Sometimes they just get a bit disoriented and lose their way, but we know the trick to get 'em going again, don't you worry.\" \"Fantastic\" Simon replies. \r\n\r\nThe driver then grabs a couple of bricks extends his arms out horizontally and brings them together in a mighty thump right on the camels balls. VRRRROOOOOOOMMMMMMMM... the camel is gone in a plume of dust. \"Incredible, look at him go!\" says Simon \"But I just have one problem, the camel is definitely started, but how the heck am I going to catch him?\" The driver responds, \"Hop up on that stand for me son.\"",

He said he wanted to thank everyone for coming, many from long distances, to support them at their wedding. He especially wanted to thank the bride's and his family and to thank his new father-in-law for providing such a lavish reception. \r\n \r\nAs a token of his deep appreciation he said he wanted to give everyone a special gift just from him. So taped to the bottom of everyone's chair, including the wedding party, was a manila envelope.\r\n\r\nHe said this was his gift to everyone, and asked them to open their envelope. Inside each manila envelope was an 8x10 glossy of his bride having sex with the best man. The groom had gotten suspicious of them weeks earlier and had hired a private detective to tail them. \r\n \r\nAfter just standing there, just watching the guests' reactions for a couple of minutes, he turned to the best man and said, \"F--- you!\".Then he turned to his bride and said, \"F--- you!\" Then he turned to the dumbfounded crowd and said, \"I'm outta here.\" \r\n\r\nHe had the marriage annulled first thing in the morning. While most people would have cancelled the wedding immediately after finding about the affair, this guy goes through with the charade, as if nothing were wrong. \r\n \r\nHis revenge...making the bride's parents pay over$32,000 for a 300 guest wedding and reception, and best of all, trashing the bride's and best man's reputations in front of 300 friends and family members.  Do you think we might get a MasterCard \"priceless\" commercial out of this?\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nFinally the funny part: \r\n\r\nElegant wedding reception for 300 family members and friends...$32,000. \r\nWedding photographs commemorating the occasion...$3,000. \r\nDeluxe two week honeymoon accommodations in Maui...$8,500. \r\nThe look on everyone's face when they see the 8x10 glossy of the bride humping the best man...Priceless. \r\n \r\nThere are some things money can't buy; for everything else there's MASTERCARD!!!",

The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: \"You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be better in two weeks.\" \r\n\r\nLater that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message: \r\n\r\n\"Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic. Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer.

        "body": "I. Know that although the cat has the advantage of quickness and lack of concern for human life, you have the advantage of strength. Capitalize on that advantage by selecting the battlefield. Don't try to bathe him in an open area where he can force you to chase him. Pick a very small bathroom. If your bathroom is more than four feet square, I recommend that you get in the tub with the cat and close the sliding -glass doors as if you were about to take a shower. (A simple shower curtain will not do. A berserk cat can shred a three-ply rubber shower curtain quicker than a politician can shift positions.) \r\n\r\nII. Know that a cat has claws and will not hesitate to remove all the skin from your body. Your advantage here is that you are smart and know how to dress to protect yourself. I recommend canvas overalls tucked into high-top construction boots, a pair of steel-mesh gloves, an army helmet, a hockey face-mask, and a long-sleeved flak jacket. \r\n\r\nIII. Use the element of surprise. Pick up your cat nonchalantly, as if to simply carry him to his supper dish. (Cats will not usually notice your strange attire. They have little or no interest in fashion as a rule.) \r\n\r\nIV. Once you are inside the bathroom, speed is essential to survival. In a single liquid motion, shut the bathroom door, step into the tub enclosure, slide the glass door shut, dip the cat in the water and squirt him with shampoo. You have begun one of the wildest 45 seconds of your life. \r\n\r\nV. Cats have no handles. Add the fact that he now has soapy fur, and the problem is radically compounded. Do not expect to hold on to him for more than two or three seconds at a time. When you have him, however, you must remember to give him another squirt of shampoo and rub like crazy. He'll then spring free and fall back into the water, thereby rinsing himself off. (The national record for cats is three latherings, so don't expect too much.) \r\n\r\nIV. Next, the cat must be dried. Novice cat bathers always assume this part will be the most difficult, for humans generally are worn out at this point and the cat is just getting really determined. In fact, the drying is simple compared with what you have just been through. That's because by now the cat is semi-permanently affixed to your right leg. You simply pop the drain plug with your foot, reach for your towel and wait. (Occasionally, however, the cat will end up clinging to the top of your army helmet. If this happens, the best thing you can do is to shake him loose and to encourage him toward your leg.) After all the water is drained from the tub, it is a simple matter to just reach down and dry the cat. In a few days the cat will relax enough to be removed from your leg. He will usually have nothing to say for about three weeks and will spend a lot of time sitting with his back to you. He might even become psychoceramic and develop the fixed stare of a plaster figurine. You will be tempted to assume he is angry. This isn't usually the case. As a rule he is simply plotting ways to get through your defenses and injure you for life the next time you decide to give him a bath. \r\n\r\nBut at least now he smells a lot better.",

He had white paint on his face, and was gesturing annoyingly at Trouser's masters. This strange person spoke not a word, but proceeded to pretend that he was trapped in a box and that he was pulling on a long rope. Seeing the sheer horror on his masters' faces, Trouser took it upon himself to rectify the situation. With a low growl he jumped and sank his teeth into this annoying pseudo clown's leg. Trouser immediately got a sickened look in his eyes and began to vomit wildly. He then dragged his tongue all over the ground in an effort to remove the man's foul essence from his mouth.

The professor was very strict and told the class that any exam that was not on his desk in exactly two hours would not be accepted and the student would fail.

You may glance at her, so long as you do not peer at anything below her neck. If you cannot keep your eyes or hands off of my daughter's body, I will remove them.\r\n\r\nRule Three - I am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age to wear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off their hips. Please don't take this as an insult, but you and all of your friends are complete idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open minded about this issue, so I propose this compromise: You may come to the door with your underwear showing and your pants ten sizes too big, and I will not object. However, In order to ensure that your clothes do not, in fact, come off during the course of your date with my daughter, I will take my electric nail gun and fasten your trousers securely in place to your waist.\r\n\r\nRule Four - I'm sure you've been told that in today's world, sex without utilizing a \"barrier method\" of some kind can kill you. Let me elaborate: when it comes to sex, I am the barrier, and I will kill you. \r\n\r\nRule Five - In order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about sports, politics, and other issues of the day. Please do not do this. The only information I require from you is an indication of when you expect to have my daughter safely back at my house, and the only word I need from you on this subject is \"early.\"\r\n\r\nRule Six - I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities to date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you will continue to date no one but her until she is finished with you. If you make her cry, I will make you cry.\r\n\r\nRule Seven - As you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my daughter to appear, and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to be on time for the movie, you should not be dating. My daughter is putting on her makeup, a process that can take longer than painting the Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why don't you do something useful, like changing the oil in my car?\r\n\r\nRule Eight - The following places are not appropriate for a date with my daughter: Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a wooden stool. Places where there are no parents, policemen, or nuns within eyesight. Places where there is darkness. Places where there is dancing, holding hands, or happiness. Places where the ambient temperature is warm enough to induce my daughter to wear shorts, tank tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything other than overalls, a sweater, and a goose down parka zipped up to her throat. Movies with a strong romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which feature chainsaws are okay. Hockey games are okay. Old folks homes are better.\r\n\r\nRule Nine - Do not lie to me. I may appear to be a pot-bellied, balding, middle-aged, dim-witted has-been. But on issues relating to my daughter, I am the all-knowing, merciless god of your universe. If I ask you where you are going and with whom, you have one chance to tell me the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I have a shotgun, a shovel, and five acres behind the house. Do not trifle with me.\r\n\r\nRule Ten - Be afraid. Be very afraid. It takes very little for me to mistake the sound of your car in the driveway for a chopper coming in over a rice paddy outside of Hanoi. When my Agent Orange starts acting up, the voices in my head frequently tell me to clean the guns as I wait for you to bring my daughter home. As soon as you pull into the driveway you should exit your car with both hands in plain sight. Speak the perimeter password, announce in a clear voice that you have brought my daughter home safely and early, then return to your car - there is no need for you to come inside.

I have been remiss in writing and I am very sorry for my thoughtlessness in not writing before.  I will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, please sit down.  You are not to read further unless you are sitting down, okay?    \r\n \r\nWell, then, I'm getting along pretty well now.  The skull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out of the window of my dormitory when it caught fire shortly after my arrival here is pretty well  healed.  I only spent two weeks in the hospital and now I can see almost normally and only get those sick headaches once a day.    \r\n \r\nFortunately, the fire in the dormitory and my jump was witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm, and he was the one who called the fire department and the ambulance.  He also visited me in the hospital and since I have nowhere to live because of the burnt-out dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment.    \r\nIt's really a basement room, and it's kind of cute.  \r\n\r\nHe is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to get married. We haven't set the exact date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy  begins to show.  I know how much you are looking forward to being   grandparents, and I know you will welcome the baby and give it the  same love and devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child.    \r\n\r\nThe reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend has a minor infection that prevents us from passing our premarital blood tests and I carelessly caught it from him.  I have bumps all over my \"down there\" but this will soon clear up with the penicillin injections I am taking daily.  I know that you will welcome him into our family with open arms.  He is kind and although not well educated, he is ambitious.  Although he is of a different race, color and religion than ours, I know your often-expressed tolerance will not  permit you to be bothered by this fact.    \r\n \r\nNow that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you that there was no dormitory fire.  I did not have a concussion or a skull fracture.  I was not in the hospital.  I am not pregnant.  I am not   engaged.  I do not have a disease and there is no miscegenation in my life.

Sometimes, it would not ring when someone called. \r\n\r\nThe strange part, she said, was that when it did ring, the ring was invariably preceded by her dog barking. So she was convinced she had a broken telephone and a psychic dog. \r\n\r\nNow, in Britain, the ring signal is a high-voltage low-ampere current sent from the local office to the phone. The wire which carries this signal is run from the pole to a large metal spike in the yard, which grounds the circuit. \r\n\r\nIn order to isolate the problem, the phone company sent a repairman out to climb the pole and manually send the signal down the wire. Sure enough, when he did this, nothing happened the first time. The second time, the dog barked just before the phone rang. \r\n\r\nInvestigation revealed that the dog was chained (with an iron chain) to the spike that grounded the circuit. So this is what was happening: the ground was dry, preventing the ring signal from grounding itself easily through the spike, so the current ran down the chain to the dog, paralyzing him. \r\n\r\nWhen the current released the dog, he yelped and urinated, which wet the ground, so that the second ring signal made it through and the phone rang.",

She replied, \"$165,000!\" and dumped the cash out of her bag onto his desk. The president was of course curious as to how she came by all this cash, so he asked her, \"Ma'am, I'm surprised you're carrying so much cash around. \"Where did you get this money?\" \r\nThe old lady replied, \"I make bets.\" The president then asked, \"Bets? What kind of bets?\" \r\nThe old woman said, \"Well, for example, I'll bet you $25,000 that your balls are square.\" \r\n\"Ha!\" laughed the president, \"That's a stupid bet. You can never win that kind of bet!\" \r\nThe old lady challenged, \"So, would you like to take my bet?\"  \"Sure,\" said the president, I'll bet $25,000 that my balls are not square!\" \r\nThe little old lady then said, \"Okay, but since there is a lot of money involved, may I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10:00 AM as a witness?\" \r\n\"Sure!\" replied the confident president. \r\nThat night, the president got very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of a mirror checking his balls, turning from side to side, again and again. He thoroughly checked them out until he was sure there was absolutely no way his balls were square and that he would win the bet. \r\nThe next morning, at precisely 10:00 am, the little old lady appeared with her lawyer at the president's office. She introduced the lawyer to the president and repeated the bet: \"$25,000 says the president's balls are square!\"  The president agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his pants so they could all see. The president did. The little old lady peered closely at his balls and ! then asked if she could feel them. \r\n\"Well, Okay,\" said the president, \"$25,000 is a lot of money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure.\" Just then, he noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the wall. The President asked the old lady, \"What the hell's the matter with your lawyer?\"  She replied, \"Nothing, except I bet him $100,000 that at 10:00 AM today, I'd have The Bank of Canada's president's balls in my hand.\"",

I want to take my money to the afterlife with me.\" \r\nAnd so he got his wife to promise him with all of her heart that when he died, she would put all of the money in the casket with him. \r\nWell, he died. He was stretched out in the casket, his wife was sitting there in black, and her friend was sitting next to her. When they finished the ceremony, just before the undertakers got ready to close the casket, the wife said, \"Wait just a minute!' She had a box with her,she came over with the box and put it in the casket. Then the undertakers locked the casket down, and they rolled it away. \r\nSo her friend said, \"Girl, I know you weren't fool enough to put all that money in there with your husband.\" She said, \"Listen, I'm a Christian, I can't go back on my word.

If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with roller blades, they can ignite. \r\n\r\n4. If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong enough to rotate a 42-pound boy wearing Batman underwear and a superman cape. It is strong enough, however, to spread paint on all four walls of a large room. \r\n\r\n5. When using the ceiling fan as a baseball bat, you have to throw the ball up a few times before you get a hit. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way. \r\n\r\n6. The glass in windows (even double pane) doesn't stop a baseball hit by a ceiling fan. \r\n\r\n7. When you hear the toilet flush and the words \"Uh-oh,\" it's already too late. \r\n\r\n8. Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke, and lots of it. \r\n\r\n9. A six-year-old can start a fire with a flint rock even though a 36-year-old man says they can only do it in the movies. A magnifying glass can start a fire even on an overcast day. \r\n\r\n10. Certain Legos will pass through the digestive tract of a six-year-old. \r\n\r\n11. \"Play-Doh\" and \"microwave\" should never be used in the same sentence. \r\n\r\n12.

VCRs do not eject PB&J sandwiches even though TV commercials show they do. \r\n\r\n16. A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2000 sq. foot house 4 inches deep. \r\n\r\n17. Marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise in a moving car. \r\n\r\n18. You probably do not want to know what that odor is. \r\n\r\n19. Always look in the oven before you turn it on.

They are called Saturday & Sunday. \r\n\r\nBEREAVEMENT LEAVE\r\nThis is no excuse for missing work. There is nothing you can do for dead friends, relatives or co-workers. Every effort should be made to have non-employees attend to the arrangements. In rare cases where employee involvement is necessary, the funeral should be scheduled in the late afternoon. We will be glad to allow you to work through your lunch hour and subsequently leave one hour early.\r\n\r\nRESTROOM USE\r\nEntirely too much time is being spent in the restroom. There is now a strict 3 minute time limit in the stalls. At the end of three minutes, an alarm will sound, the toilet paper roll will retract, the stall door will open and a picture will be taken. After your second offense, your picture will be posted on the company bulletin board under the \"Chronic Offenders\" category.\r\n\r\nLUNCH BREAK\r\nSkinny people get 30 minutes for lunch as they need to eat more, so that they can look healthy. Normal size people get 15 minutes for lunch to get a balanced meal to maintain their average figure. Fat people get 5 minutes for lunch, because that's all the time needed to drink a Slim Fast.\r\n\r\nThank you for your loyalty to our company. We are here to provide a positive employment experience. Therefore, all questions, comments, concerns, complaints, frustrations, irritations, aggravations, insinuations, allegations, accusations, contemplations, consternation, and input should be directed elsewhere. \r\n\r\nHave a nice week!\r\n\r\nTHE MANAGEMENT",

While he was gone, the first day she lovingly put her personal belongings into boxes and crates and suitcases. On the second day, she had the movers come and collect her things. On the third day, she sat down for the last time at their candlelit Dining table, soft music playing in the background, and feasted on a pound of shrimp and a bottle of Chardonnay. When she had finished, she went into each room and deposited a few of the resulting shrimp shells into the hollow of the curtain rods. She then cleaned up the kitchen and left. The husband came back, with his new girl, and all was bliss for the first few days. Then it started; slowly but surely. Clueless, the man could not explain why the place smelled so bad. They tried everything; cleaned & mopped and aired the place out. Vents were checked for dead rodents, carpets were steam cleaned, Air fresheners were hung everywhere. Exterminators were brought in, the carpets were replaced, and on it went. Finally, they could take it no more and decided to move.

Speedos cannot be worn by men under the following conditions:\r\n\r\n1A) If when you look down, you can't see the color of your Speedo, you probably should not be wearing one. No matter how manly your chest may be, if your belly exceeds your chest, it is not arousing to women to see your skimpy bathing suit.\r\n\r\n1B) If your belly hangs down over the top of the Speedo, you should not be wearing one. No, women are not impressed that you can do finger acrobatics tying up your Speedo with only one hand, as the other hand is being used to lift up the fold of skin of your belly hanging mercilessly down over the top of your Speedo.\r\n\r\n1C) If you have one of those penises that kind of stick straight out as opposed to hang down, you should not be wearing one.

Teepees are for Indian reservations and not for the pool thankyouverymuch.\r\n\r\n2) If you cannot wear a Speedo, and are wearing short type bathing suits, please for the sake of all humankind, wear one with an inner shell. There is nothing sexier than seeing your boys hanging down as you sit in that position that only a man can do so gracelessly, but it is impolite to be the cause of so many women getting so horny at midday, so keep your boys hidden.\r\n\r\n3) No thongs under any circumstances.\r\n\r\n4) If you wear sandals, do not wear white knee socks.",

Here are the facts about the three leading candidates.\r\n\r\nCandidate A -\r\nAssociates with crooked politicians, and consults with astrologists. He's had two Mistresses. He also chain smokes and drinks 8 to 10 martinis a day.\r\n\r\nCandidate B -\r\nHe was kicked out of office twice, sleeps until noon, used opium in college and drinks a quart of whiskey every evening.\r\n\r\nCandidate C -\r\nHe is a decorated war hero. He's a vegetarian, doesn't  smoke, drinks an occasional \r\nbeer and never cheated on his wife.\r\n\r\nWhich of these candidates would be your choice? Decide first, no peeking, then scroll down for the answer.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nCandidate A is Franklin D.

CAUTION: Do not get any part of your body too close to the edge, as his paws will be reaching out for any purchase they can find. The cat will self-agitate and make ample suds. Never mind the noises that come from your toilet, the cat is actually enjoying this. \r\n\r\n5. Flush the toilet three or four times. This provides a \"powerwash and rinse\" which I have found to be quite effective. \r\n\r\n6. Have someone open the door to the outside and ensure that there are no people between the toilet and the outside door. \r\n\r\n7. Stand behind the toilet as far as you can, and quickly lift both lids. \r\n\r\n8. The now-clean cat will rocket out of the toilet, and run outside where he will dry himself.",

Then he had an idea...\r\n\r\nAfter looking over the handsome, impeccably dressed and dignified city lawyer in his $2,000 navy blue pinstriped suit, carefully knotted red silk tie, starched white shirt, silver cufflinks and black dress shoes polished like mirrors, $1,000 briefcase and hundred dollar haircut, the redneck walked back to his car, got out a bottle, and brought it back. \r\n\r\nHe handed it to the hotshot and said, \"Here, you look pretty shook up. I think you ought to take a nip of this. It'll steady your nerves....IT'S HOMEMADE...\" \r\n\r\nThe lawyer did, but was so angry about the wreck, he refused to speak. The redneck then said, \"You still look a little bit pale. How about another?\" And the smug, pompous lawyer took another swallow. After a few minutes, he began to feel the heat of the sun through his wool suit.\r\n\r\nThen the redneck said \"It's mighty hot today. Folks 'round here don't usually wear shoes on a day like those. Why don't you take off them fancy shoes, and the socks, too?\"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer frowned: \"Take off my shoes and socks? Do I LOOK like someone who would walk around barefoot? That's fine for hicks, but not for a professional like ME! These are $500 shoes!\"\r\n\r\nBut after a few more sips, the redneck asked him again, and then again, and then again, and finally the lawyer, feeling the white lightnin',  let out a laugh and took off his polished shoes and socks. Then the redneck said: \"Why don't you take off that fancy necktie?\"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer said: \"My tie!\", but in a minute, the silk tie was dropped on top of the shoes and the socks.\r\n\r\nThe redneck grinned and held up an extra pair of overalls he found in his pickup. \"And that fancy business suit? You look kind of funny standing there barefoot in a suit on a 100 degree day!

He tried to resist, but...\r\n\r\nOff came the jacket of the $2,000 pinstriped suit. Then the starched white shirt. Finally, the trousers, too, and the lawyer pulled on the overalls. \r\n\r\n\"Now ain't that more comfortable?!\" said the redneck.\r\n\r\nAt the urging of the redneck, the lawyer then took another sip, and another, and another. \r\n\r\nThe suspenders and the cufflinks and the briefcase were all in a heap now, and the lawyer was having a hard time standing up. After another half hour, the lawyer said he was feeling pretty good, and asked the redneck if he didn't think that he ought to have a little nip, too. Then he realized he couldn't find the redneck...\r\n\r\n\"Not me\", the redneck replied, stepping out from behind a tree. The lawyer stared at him in shock, but was now so drunk he couldn't stand up.  The redneck was wearing the lawyer's clothes, holding his briefcase, shaving with a razor he found in the briefcase and holding the keys to his BMW. \r\n\r\nThen he reached over and pulled the Rolex off the lawyer's arm and as a final touch, rubbed some dirt into the lawyer's manicured hands and expensive haircut.

Some of the best humor is in the misspelling.\r\n\r\n\r\nAncient Egypt was inhabited by mummies and they all wrote in hydraulics. They lived in the Sarah Dessert. The climate of the Sarah is such that all the inhabitants have to live elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMoses led the Hebrew slaves to the Red Sea where they made unleavened read, which is bread made without any ingredients. Moses went up on Mount Cyanide to get the ten commandments. He died before he ever reached Canada.\r\n\r\nSolomon had three hundred wives and seven hundred porcupines.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks were a highly sculptured people, and without them we wouldn't have history. The Greeks also had myths. A myth is a female moth.\r\n\r\nSocrates was a famous Greek teacher who went around giving people advice. They killed him. Socrates died from an overdose of wedlock. After his death, his career suffered a dramatic decline.\r\n\r\nIn the Olympic games, Greeks ran races, jumped, hurled biscuits, and threw the java.\r\n\r\nJulius Caesar extinguished himself on the battlefields of Gaul. The Ides of March murdered him because they thought he was going to be made king. Dying, he gasped out: \"Tee hee, Brutus.\"\r\n\r\nJoan of Arc was burnt to a steak and was canonized by Bernard Shaw.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth was the \"Virgin Queen.\" As a queen she was a success. When she exposed herself before her troops they all shouted \"hurrah.\"\r\n\r\nIt was an age of great inventions and discoveries. Gutenberg invented removable type and the Bible. Another important invention was the circulation of blood. Sir Walter Raleigh is a historical figure because he invented cigarettes and started smoking. Sir Francis Drake circumsized the world with a 100 foot clipper.\r\n\r\nThe greatest writer of the Renaissance was William Shakespeare. He was born in the year 1564, supposedly on his birthday. He never made much money and is famous only because of his plays. He wrote tragedies, comedies, and hysterectomies, all in Islamic pentameter. Romeo and Juliet are an example of a heroic couple. Romeo's last wish was to be laid by Juliet.\r\n\r\nWriting at the same time as Shakespeare was Miguel Cervantes. He wrote Donkey Hote. The next great author was John Milton. Milton wrote Paradise Lost. Then his wife died and he wrote Paradise Regained.\r\n\r\nDelegates from the original 13 states formed the Contented Congress. Thomas Jefferson, a Virgin, and Benjamin Franklin were two singers of the Declaration of Independence. Franklin discovered electricity by rubbing two cats backward and declared, \"A horse divided against itself cannot stand.\" Franklin died in 1790 and is still dead.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln became America's greatest Precedent. Lincoln's mother died in infancy, and he was born in a log cabin which he built with his own hands. Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves by signing the Emasculation Proclamation. On the night of April 14, 1865, Lincoln went to the theater and got shot in his seat by one of the actors in a moving picture show. They believe the assinator was John Wilkes Booth, a supposingly insane actor. This ruined Booth's career.\r\n\r\nJohann Bach wrote a great many musical compositions and had a large number of children. In between he practiced on an old spinster which he kept up in his attic. Bach died from 1750 to the present. Bach was the most famous composer in the world and so was Handel. Handel was half German, half Italian, and half English. He was very large.\r\n\r\nBeethoven wrote music even though he was deaf. He was so deaf he wrote loud music. He took long walks in the forest even when everyone was calling for him. Beethoven expired in 1827 and later died for this.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century was a time of a great many thoughts and inventions. People stopped reproducing by hand and started reproducing by machine. The invention of the steamboat caused a network of rivers to spring up. Cyrus McCormick invented the McCormick raper, which did the work of a hundred men. Louis Pasteur discovered a cure for rabbits. Charles Darwin was a naturalist who wrote the Organ of the Species. Madman Curie discovered the radio. And Karl Marx became one of the Marx Brothers.",

She had long been suspicious of a relationship between John and his roommate, and this only made her more curious. \r\n\r\nOver the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between John and the roommate than met the eye. Reading his mom's thoughts, John volunteered, \"I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, Julie and I are just roommates.\" \r\n\r\nAbout a week later, Julie came to John and said, \"Ever since your mother came to dinner, I can't find the beautiful silver gravy ladle. You don't suppose she took it, do you?\" John said, \"Well, I doubt it, but I'll write her a letter just to be sure.\" \r\n\r\nSo he sat down and wrote: \"Dear Mother, I'm not saying you 'did' take a gravy ladle from my house, and I'm not saying you 'did not' take a gravy ladle. But the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner. Love, John\" \r\n\r\nSeveral days later, John received a letter from his mother which read: \"Dear Son, I'm not saying that you 'do' sleep with Julie, and I'm not saying that you 'do not' sleep with Julie. But the fact remains that if she were sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the gravy ladle by now. Love, Mom\"",

Seeing that gas had spilled on the floor, the wife obtained some paper towels, blotted up the gasoline and threw the towels in the toilet. The husband was treated at the hospital and was released to come home. After arriving home, he looked at the shattered patio door and the damage done to his motorcycle. He became despondent, went into the bathroom,sat on the toilet and smoked a cigarette. After finishing the cigarette, he flipped it between his legs into the toilet bowl while still seated. \r\n\r\nThe wife, who was in the kitchen,heard a loud explosion and her husband screaming. She ran into the bathroom and found her husband lying on the floor. His trousers had been blown away and he was suffering burns on the buttocks, the back of his legs and his groin. The wife again ran to the phone and called for an ambulance. \r\n\r\nThe same ambulance crew was dispatched and the wife met them on the street. The paramedics loaded the husband on the stretcher and began carrying him to the street. While they were going down the stairs to the street accompanied by the wife, one of the paramedics asked the wife how her husband had burned himself. \r\n\r\nShe told them and the paramedics started laughing so hard, one of them tipped the stretcher and dumped the husband out.

Just because one can drive on snow and ice does not mean we can't stay home the two days of the year it snows.\r\n\r\n3. If you do run your car into a ditch, don't panic. Four men in the cab of a four-wheel-drive with a 12-pack of beer and a tow chain will be along shortly. Note: Don't try to help them. Just stay out of their way: This is what they live for.\r\n\r\n4. Don't be surprised to find movie rentals and fishing bait in the same store.\r\n\r\n5. Remember: \"Y'all\" is singular.\r\n\r\n6. \"All y'all\" is plural. \"All y'all's\" is plural possessive.\r\n\r\n7. There is nothing sillier than a northerner imitating a Southern accent, unless it is a Southerner imitating a Boston accent.\r\n\r\n8. People walk slower here.\r\n\r\n9. Don't be worried that you don't understand anyone. They don't understand you either.\r\n\r\n10. The first Southern expression to creep into a transplanted Northerner's vocabulary is the adjective \"Big ol'\", as in \"big ol' truck\" or \"big ol' boy\". Eighty-five percent begin their new southern influenced dialect with this expression. One hundred percent are in denial about it.\r\n\r\n11. The proper pronunciation you learned in school is no longer proper.\r\n\r\n12. \"He needed killin'\" is a valid defense here.\r\n\r\n13. If attending a funeral in the South: remember, we stay until the last shovel of dirt is thrown on and the tent is torn down.\r\n\r\n14. If you hear a Southerner exclaim, \"Hey, y'all, watch this!\" stay out of his way. These are likely the last words he will ever say.\r\n\r\n15. Most Southerners do not use turn signals, and they ignore those who do. In fact, if you see a signal blinking on a car with a southern license plate, you may rest assured that it was on when the car was purchased.\r\n\r\n16. Northerners can be identified by the spit on the inside of their car's windshield that comes from yelling at other drivers.\r\n\r\n17. The winter wardrobe you always brought out in September can wait until November.\r\n\r\n18. If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the tiniest accumulation of snow, your presence is required at the local grocery store. It does not matter if you need anything from the store, it is just something you're supposed to do.\r\n\r\n19. Satellite dishes are very popular in the South. When you purchase one it is to be positioned directly in front of your trailer. This is logical bearing in mind that the dish cost considerably more than the trailer and should, therefore, be displayed.\r\n\r\n20. Tornadoes and Southerners going through a divorce have a lot in common. In either case, you know someone is going to lose a trailer.\r\n\r\n21. Florida is not considered a Southern state (except Gainesville). There are far more Yankees than Southerners living there.\r\n\r\n22. As you are cursing the person driving 15 mph in a 55 mph zone, directly in the middle of the road, remember, many folks learned to drive on a model of vehicle known as John Deere, and this is the proper speed and lane position for the vehicle.\r\n\r\n23. You can ask a Southerner for directions, but unless you already know the positions of key hills, trees and rocks, you're better off trying to find it yourself.",

Each bird had a sack over its head; only the legs were showing. He sat straight in the front row because he wanted to do the best job possible. The professor announced that the test would be to look at each of the birds' legs and give the common name, habitat, genus and species. \r\n\r\nThe student looked at each of the birds' legs. They all looked the same to him. He began to get upset. He had stayed up all night studying and now had to identify birds by their legs. The more he thought about it the angrier he got. \r\n\r\nFinally he could stand it no longer. He went up to the professor's desk and said, \"What a stupid test! How could anyone tell the difference between birds by looking at their legs?!\" With that, the student threw his test on the professor's desk and walked to the door. \r\n\r\nThe professor was surprised. The class was so big that he didn't know every student's name so, as the student reached the door the professor called, \"Hey mister, what's your name?\"\r\n\r\nThe enraged student turned around, pulled up his pant legs and said, \"You tell me, buddy.

If the Pope won, the\r\nJews would have to leave. \r\n\r\nThe Jewish community met and picked an aged Rabbi, Moishe,\r\nto represent them in the debate. Rabbi Moishe, however, could\r\nnot speak Latin and the Pope could not speak Yiddish. So it\r\nwas decided that this would be a \"silent\" debate. \r\n\r\nOn the day of the great debate, the Pope and Rabbi Moishe\r\nsat opposite each other for a full minute before the Pope\r\nraised his hand and showed three fingers. \r\n\r\nRabbi Moishe looked back and raised one finger. \r\n\r\nNext, the Pope waved his finger around his head. \r\n\r\nRabbi Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. \r\n\r\nThe Pope then brought out a communion wafer and chalice of\r\nwine. \r\n\r\nRabbi Moishe pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood\r\nup and said, \"I concede the debate. This man has bested me.\r\nThe Jews can stay.\" \r\n\r\nLater, the Cardinals gathered around the Pope, asking him\r\nwhat had happened. \r\n\r\nThe Pope said, \"First I held up three fingers to represent\r\nthe Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger to remind\r\nme that there was still one God common to both our religions.\r\nThen I waved my finger around me to show him that God was all\r\naround us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show\r\nthat God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine\r\nand the wafer to show that God absolves us of our sins. He\r\npulled out an apple to remind me of original sin. He had an\r\nanswer for everything. What could I do?\" \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Jewish community crowded around Rabbi Moishe,\r\nasking what happened. \"Well,\" said Moishe, \"first he said to\r\nme, 'You Jews have three days to get out of here.' So I said\r\nto him, 'Up yours'. Then he tells me the whole city would be\r\ncleared of Jews. So I said to him, 'Listen here Mr. Pope, the\r\nJews ... we stay right here!\" \r\n\r\n\"And then?\" asked a woman. \r\n\r\n\"Who knows?\" said Rabbi Moishe. \"We broke for lunch.\"",

We will hold demonstrations throughout the month so that all employees will have an opportunity to get a good look at MYASS.\r\n\r\nWe have not addressed networking aspects yet, so currently only one person at a time can use MYASS. This restriction will be removed after MYASS expands.\r\n\r\nSome employees have begun using the program already. This morning I walked into a subordinate's office and was not surprised to find that he had his nose buried in MYASS. Some of the less technical people may be somewhat afraid of MYASS.\r\n\r\nLast week my secretary said to me, \"I'm a little nervous, I never put anything in MYASS before.\" I helped her through the first time and afterward she admitted that it was relatively painless and she was actually looking forward to doing it again, and was even ready to kiss MYASS.\r\n\r\nThere have been concerns over the virus that was found in MYASS upon initial installation, but the virus has been eliminated and we were able to save MYASS. In the future, however, protection will be required prior to entering MYASS.\r\n\r\nThis database will encompass all information associated with the business. As you begin using the program, feel free to put anything you want in MYASS. As MYASS grows larger, we envision a time when it will be commonplace for a supervisor to hand work to an employee and say, \"Here, stick this in MYASS.\"",

Without a guide, they decided to learn English word by word in the simplest way they could think of -- continuously browsing through the dictionary, picking at random a certain word and look up its definition.\r\n\r\nSo they went into a coffee shop and started off right away. The first word they came upon happened to be \"Ouch\" which was defined as \"an interjection used to express a mixed feeling of surprise, sudden pain and anger.\" It was then that they suddenly realized they did not have the slightest idea what those cryptic pronunciation symbols might sound like. Thinking hard, one of the Frenchmen finally came up with a bright idea:\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't worry, mon ami. I suppose the best way for us to learn how to pronounce that word is to get a native say it out loud!\"\r\n\r\n\"But how? I'm afraid nobody in this busy town is going to help us,\" said the other guy.\r\n\r\n\"They will, even if they don't want to, mon ami,\" smiled the first man. \"Do you see that jolie blonde walking out there? Yes, there! Go out and pinch her cute tits as hard you can! Listen carefully for the \"ouch\" she should be uttering; you can be sure that's the most authentic pronunciation we'll ever get!\"\r\n\r\nThe other Frenchman nodded with a wink and went out for his awkward assignment. A moment later he came back looking completely dumbfounded. He told his friend in a doubtful voice,\r\n\r\n\"Bon Dieu, did I think English is easy, duh! I didn't expect this simple word alone could have such a hell of a long and messy pronunciation!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on, what did you hear then?\"\r\n\r\n\"She pronounced the word something like 'dzou gah-daime mah-de-feuck-igne aiss-haule'. Isn't that amazing !!\"",

Never use \"fine\" to describe how a woman looks - this will cause you to have one of those arguments.\r\n\r\nFIVE MINUTES\r\n\r\nThis is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so it's an even trade.\r\n\r\nNOTHING\r\n\r\nThis means \"something,\" and you should be on your toes. \"Nothing\" is usually used to describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside down, and backwards. \"Nothing\" usually signifies an argument that will last \"Five Minutes\" and end with \"Fine\"\r\n\r\nGO AHEAD (With Raised Eyebrows!)\r\n\r\nThis is a dare. One that will result in a woman getting upset over \"Nothing\" and will end with the word \"Fine\"\r\n\r\nGO AHEAD (Normal Eyebrows)\r\n\r\nThis means \"I give up\" or \"do what you want because I don't care\" You will get a \"Raised Eyebrow Go Ahead\" in just a few minutes, followed by \"Nothing\" and \"Fine\" and she will talk to you in about \"Five Minutes\" when she cools off.\r\n\r\nLOUD SIGH\r\n\r\nThis is not actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement often misunderstood by men. A \"Loud Sigh\" means she thinks you are an idiot at that moment, and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over \"Nothing\"\r\n\r\nSOFT SIGH\r\n\r\nAgain, not a word, but a non-verbal statement. \"Soft Sighs\" mean that she is content. Your best bet is to not move or breathe, and she will stay content.\r\n\r\nTHAT'S OKAY\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can make to a man. \"That's Okay\" means that she wants to think long and hard before paying you back for whatever it is that you have done. \r\n\"That's Okay\" is often used with the word \"Fine\" and in conjunction with a \"Raised Eyebrow.\"\r\n\r\nGO AHEAD!\r\n\r\nAt some point in the near future, you are going to be in some mighty big trouble.\r\n\r\nPLEASE DO\r\n\r\nThis is not a statement, it is an offer. A woman is giving you the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance with the truth, so be careful and you shouldn't get a \"That's Okay\".\r\n\r\nTHANKS\r\n\r\nA woman is thanking you. Do not faint. Just say you're welcome.\r\n\r\nTHANKS A LOT\r\n\r\nThis is much different from \"Thanks.\" A woman will say, \"Thanks A Lot\" when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you have offended her in some callous way, and will be followed by the \"Loud Sigh.\" Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the \"Loud Sigh,\" as she will only tell you \"Nothing\".\r\n\r\nSend this to the men you know to warn them about future arguments they can avoid if they remember the terminology!",

You asked for a fuller explanation and I trust the following details will be sufficient.\r\n\r\nI am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working alone on the roof of a new six-story building. When I completed my work, I found that I had some bricks left over which, when weighed later were found to be slightly in excess of 500lbs. Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley, which was attached to the side of the building on the sixth floor.\r\n\r\nSecuring the rope to the ground I went up to the roof, swung the barrel out and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went down and untied the rope, holding it tightly to ensure a slow descent of the bricks.\r\n\r\nYou will note in Block 11 of the accident report form that I weigh 135 lbs.\r\n\r\nDue to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel, which was now proceeding downward at an equally impressive speed. This explained the fractured skull, minor abrasions and the broken collar bone, as listed in Section 3 of the accident report form. I slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley. Fortunately by this time I had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope, in spite of beginning to experience pain.\r\n\r\nAt approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel. Now devoid of the weight of the bricks, that barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs. I refer you again to my weight. As you can imagine, I began a rapid descent, down the side of the building.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up. This accounts for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and several lacerations of my legs and lower body. Here my luck began to change slightly. The encounter with the barrel seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of bricks and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked. I am sorry to report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in pain, unable to move, I again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope and I lay there watching the empty barrel begin its journey back down onto me. This explains the two broken legs. I hope this answers your inquiry.",

What's your second wish?\"\r\n \r\n\"Genie, I want the most expensive Porsche made: Fire engine red, on board GPS and the finest audio system ever installed in an automobile.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's easy, Guy,\" says the genie. He waves his hand and best car anybody had ever seen pops out of the lamp. The genie then asks the guy for his third wish.\r\n\r\nThe guy mulls the problem over and over. A girl--nah, with billions and billions of dollars he certainly had become a girl magnet. World peace? Only wackos want that. The guy could not find anything that warranted using his third and last wish.\r\n \r\n\"Genie,\" the guy said, \"I can't think of anything now.  May I save the third wish for later?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gee, this is most unusual. But you hold the hammer, and I can't escape from this lamp until you make a third wish. Call me when you're ready,\" and whoosh the genie disappears into the lamp.\r\n \r\nThe guy carefully picks up the now-ever-so-valuable lamp and places it in the trunk of the fire engine red Porsche. He turns on the radio to balance the sounds and makes all the other adjustments needed to get his great audio system customized to his ears.\r\n \r\nAfter that, he pulls off the beach and heads south along the Pacific Coast Highway. Soon he's up to 60, then 70, then 80. The Porsche handled perfectly.

        "body": "My friend is a rather old-fashioned lady, always quite delicate and elegant, especially in her language. She and her husband were planning a week's vacation in Florida, so she wrote to a particular campground and asked for a reservation. She wanted to make sure the campground was properly equipped, but didn't quite know how to ask about the \"toilet\" facitilities. She just couldn't bring herself to write the word \"toilet\" in her letter. After much deliberation, she finally came up the the old-fashioned term \"bathroom commode\". But after she wrote that down, she still thought she was being too forward. So, she started all over again and re-wrote the entire letter. This time, she referred to the bathroom commode as merely B.C. \"Does the campground have its own B.C.?\" she wrote.\r\n\r\nThe campground owner wasn't old-fashioned, and he just couldn't figure out what the woman was talking about. The business about \"B.C.\" stumped him. After much thought and deliberation, he showed the letter to other campers to get their opinions, but they didn't know either. The campground owner finally decided that the woman was asking about the location of the Baptist Church, and sat down and wrote this reply:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Madam:\r\n\r\nI regret the delay in answering your letter, but I now take great pleasure in informing you that a B.C. is located nine miles north of the campground, and is capable of seating 250 people at one time. I admit it is quite a distance away if you are in the habit of going regularly, but no doubt you will be pleased to know that a great number of people take their lunches along and make a day of it. They usually arrive early and stay late.\r\n\r\nThe last time my wife and I went was 6 years ago, and it was so crowded we had to stand up the whole time we were there. It may interest you to know that right now, there is a supper planned to raise money to buy more seats. They're going to hold it in the basement of the B.C. I would like to say it pains me very much not to be able to go more regularly, but it surely is through no lack of desire on my end. As we grow older, it seems to take more of an effort, particularly in cold weather. If you decide to come down to our campground, perhaps I could go with you the first time you go, sit with you, and introduce you to all the other folks.\r\n\r\nRemember, this is a very friendly community.\r\n\r\nBest Regards, \r\nThe Campgound Owner\"",

The wife liked to read.\r\n\r\n One morning the husband returned after several hours of fishing and decided to take a nap. Although not familiar with the lake, the wife decided to take the boat out. She motored out a short distance, anchored, and continued to read her book. \r\n \r\nAlong came a game warden in his boat. He pulled up alongside  the woman and said, \" Good morning Ma'am. What are you doing?\" \r\n\r\n\"Reading a book,\" she replied, (thinking \"isn't that obvious?\") \r\n\r\n\"You're in a restricted fishing area,\" he informed her. \r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry officer, but I'm not fishing, I'm reading.\" \r\n\r\n\"Yes, but you have all the equipment. I'll have to take you in and write you up.\" \r\n \r\n\"If you do that, I'll have to charge you with sexual  assault,\" said the woman.  \r\n\r\n\"But I haven't even touched you,\" said the game warden. \r\n\r\n\"That's true, but you have all the equipment.\" \r\n \r\n\r\nMORAL: Never argue with a woman who reads. It's likely  she can also think.",

Fully HALF of all children who grow up in bread consuming households score below average on standardized tests.\r\n\r\n3. In the 18th century, when virtually all bread was baked in the home, the average life expectancy was less than 50 years; infant mortality rates were unacceptably high; many women died in childbirth; and diseases such as typhoid, yellow fever, and influenza ravaged whole nations.\r\n\r\n4. More than 90 percent of violent crimes are committed within 24 hours of eating bread.\r\n\r\n5. Bread has been proven to be addictive. Subjects deprived of bread and given only water to eat, begged for bread after as little as two days.\r\n\r\n6. Bread is often a \"gateway\" food item, leading the user to \"harder\" items such as butter, jelly, peanut butter, and even cream cheese.\r\n\r\n7. Bread has been proven to absorb water. Since the human body is more than 90 percent water, it follows that eating bread could lead to your body being taken over by this absorptive food product, turning you into a soggy, gooey , bread-pudding person.\r\n\r\n8. Newborn babies can choke on bread.\r\n\r\n9. Bread is baked at temperatures as high as 450 degrees Fahrenheit! That kind of heat can kill an adult in less than two minutes.\r\n\r\n10.

The recipe said, \"Beat 12 eggs separately.\" The neighbors were nice enough to loan me some extra bowls.\r\n\r\nTuesday: John wanted fruit salad for supper. The recipe said, \"Serve without dressing.\" So I didn't dress. What a surprise when John brought a friend home for supper.\r\n\r\nWednesday: A good day for rice. Recipe said, \"Wash thoroughly before steaming the rice.\" It seemed kinda of silly but I took a bath. I can't say it improved the rice any.\r\n\r\nThursday: Today John asked for salad again. I tried a new recipe. It said, \"Prepare ingredients, then toss on a bed of lettuce one hour before serving.\" Which is what led up to John asking me why I was rolling around in the garden.\r\n\r\nFriday: I found an easy recipe for cookies. It said, \"Put all 20 ingredients in bowl and beat it.\" There must have been something wrong with this recipe. When I got back, everything was the same as when I left.\r\n\r\nSaturday: John did the shopping today and brought home a chicken. He asked me to dress it for Sunday. (oh boy) For some reason John keeps counting to ten.\r\n\r\nSunday: John's folks came to dinner. I wanted to serve roast. All I could find was hamburger. Suddenly, I had a flash of genius. I put the hamburger in the oven and set the controls for roast. It still came out hamburger, much to my disappointment.\r\n\r\nGood night, Dear Diary. This has been a very exciting week. I am eager for tomorrow to come so I can try out a new recipe on John.",

I want to buy one.\r\nABBOTT: Mac?\r\nCOSTELLO: I told you, my name is Bud.\r\nABBOTT: What about Windows?\r\nCOSTELLO: Why? Does it get stuffy?\r\nABBOTT: Do you want a computer with Windows?\r\nCOSTELLO: I don't know. What do I see when I look out the windows?\r\nABBOTT: Wallpaper.\r\n\r\nCOSTELLO: Never mind the windows. I need a computer and software.\r\nABBOTT: Software that runs on Windows?\r\nCOSTELLO: No, on the computer! I need something I can use to write proposals, track expenses. You know, run a business. What have you got?\r\nABBOTT: Office.\r\nCOSTELLO: Yeah, for my office. Can you recommend anything?\r\nABBOTT: I just did.\r\nCOSTELLO: You just did what?\r\nABBOTT: Recommend something.\r\nCOSTELLO: You recommended something?\r\nABBOTT: Yes.\r\nCOSTELLO: For my office?\r\nABBOTT: Yes.\r\nCOSTELLO: Okay, what did you recommend for my office?\r\nABBOTT: Office.\r\nCOSTELLO: Yes, for my office.\r\nABBOTT: Office for Windows.\r\n\r\nCOSTELLO: I already have an office and it already has windows! Let's say I'm sitting at my computer, and I want to type a proposal. What do I need?\r\nABBOTT: Word.\r\nCOSTELLO: If I'm writing a proposal, I'm going to need lots of words. But what program do I load?\r\nABBOTT: Word.\r\nCOSTELLO: What word?\r\nABBOTT: The Word in Office.\r\nCOSTELLO: The only word in \"office\" is \"office.\"\r\nABBOTT: The Word in Office for Windows.\r\nCOSTELLO: Which word in \"office for windows\"?\r\nABBOTT: The Word you get when you click the blue W.\r\n\r\nCOSTELLO: I'm going to click your big blue W if you don't give me a straight answer. Let's forget about words for a minute. What do I need if I want to watch a movie over the Internet?\r\nABBOTT: RealOne.\r\nCOSTELLO: Maybe a real movie, maybe a cartoon. What I watch is none of your business. But what do I need to watch it?\r\nABBOTT: RealOne.\r\nCOSTELLO: If it's a long movie I'll also want to watch reels two, three, and four. Can I watch reel four?\r\nABBOTT: Of course.\r\nCOSTELLO: Great! With what?\r\nABBOTT: RealOne.\r\n\r\nCOSTELLO: Okay, so I'm sitting at my computer and I want to watch a movie. What do I do?\r\nABBOTT: You click the blue 1.\r\nCOSTELLO: I click the blue one what?\r\nABBOTT: The blue 1.\r\nCOSTELLO: Is that different from the blue W?\r\nABBOTT: Of course it is. The blue 1 is RealOne. The blue W is Word.\r\nCOSTELLO: What word?\r\nABBOTT: The Word in Office for Windows.\r\nCOSTELLO: But there are three words in \"office for windows\"!\r\nABBOTT: No, just one. But it's the most popular Word in the world.\r\nCOSTELLO: It is?\r\nABBOTT: Yes, although to be fair there aren't many other Words left. It pretty much wiped out all the other Words.\r\nCOSTELLO: And that word is the real one?\r\nABBOTT: No. RealOne has nothing to do with Word. RealOne isn't even part of Office.\r\n\r\nCOSTELLO: Never mind; I don't want to get started with that again. But I also need something for bank accounts, loans, and so on. What do you have to help me track my money?\r\nABBOTT: Money.\r\nCOSTELLO: That's right. What do you have?\r\nABBOTT: Money.\r\nCOSTELLO: I need money to track my money?\r\nABBOTT: Money.\r\nCOSTELLO: Money comes bundled with my computer?\r\nABBOTT: Exactly. No extra charge.\r\nCOSTELLO: I get a bundle of money with my computer at no extra charge? How much money do I get?\r\nABBOTT: Just one copy.\r\nCOSTELLO: I get a copy of money. Isn't that illegal?\r\nABBOTT: No. We have a license from Microsoft to make copies of Money.\r\nCOSTELLO: Microsoft can license you to make money?\r\nABBOTT: Why not? They own it.\r\n\r\nCOSTELLO: Well, it's great that I'm going to get free money, but I'll still need to track it. Do you have anything for managing your money?\r\nABBOTT: Managing Your Money? That program disappeared years ago.\r\nCOSTELLO: Well, what do you sell in its place?\r\nABBOTT: Money.\r\nCOSTELLO: You sell money?\r\nABBOTT: Of course. But if you buy a computer from us, you get it for free.\r\n\r\nCOSTELLO: That's all very wonderful, but I'll be running a business. Do you have any software for, you know, accounting?\r\nABBOTT: Simply Accounting.\r\nCOSTELLO: Probably, but it might get a little complicated.\r\nABBOTT: If you don't want Simply Accounting, you might try M.Y.O.B.\r\nCOSTELLO: M.Y.O.B.? What does that stand for?\r\nABBOTT: Mind Your Own Business.\r\nCOSTELLO: I beg your pardon?\r\nABBOTT: No, that would be I.B.Y.P. I said M.Y.O.B.\r\n\r\nCOSTELLO: Look, I just need to do some accounting for my home business. You know - accounting? You do it with money.\r\nABBOTT: Of course you can do accounting with Money. But you may need more.\r\nCOSTELLO: More money?\r\nABBOTT: More than Money. Money can't do everything.\r\n\r\nCOSTELLO: I don't need a sermon! Okay, let's forget about money for the moment. I'm worried that my computer might . . . what's the word? Crash. And if my computer crashes, what can I use to restore my data?\r\nABBOTT: GoBack.\r\nCOSTELLO: Okay. I'm worried about my computer crashing and I need something to restore my data. What do you recommend?\r\nABBOTT: GoBack.\r\nCOSTELLO: How many times do I have to repeat myself?\r\nABBOTT: I've never asked you to repeat yourself. All I said was GoBack.\r\n\r\nCOSTELLO: How can I go back if I haven't even been anywhere? Okay, I'll go back. What do I need to write a proposal?\r\nABBOTT: Word.\r\nCOSTELLO: But I'll need lots of words to write a proposal.\r\nABBOTT: No, you only need one Word - the Word in Office for Windows.\r\nCOSTELLO: But there's three words in . . . Oh, never mind. *click*\r\n\r\nABBOTT: Hello? Hello? Customers! Why do they always hang up on me? Oh, well",

Then I realized that Matt had not asked to go potty in a while, so I asked him, and he said \"No.\"\r\n\r\nI kept thinking, \"Oh Lord, that child has had an accident and I didn't have any clothes with me.\" Then I said, \"Matt, are you sure you did not have an accident?\" \"No,\" he replied. I just knew that he must have had, cause the smell was getting worse. So.........I asked one more time, \"Matt, did you have an accident?\"\r\n\r\nThis time, with a little smirk on his face, he jumped up, yanked down his pants, bent over and spread his cheeks and yelled......... \"SEE MOM, IT'S JUST FARTS!\"\r\n\r\nWhile 100 people nearly choked to death on their tacos, he calmly pulled up his pants and sat down to eat his food as if nothing happened.\r\n\r\nI was mortified......... but some kind elderly people made me feel a lot better, when they came over and thanked me for the best laugh they had ever had!!!",

If you have to vacuum the bed, it is time to change the sheets.\r\n5. Even if you're certain that you are included in the will, it is still rude to drive the U-Haul to the funeral home.\r\n\r\nENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME\r\n1. A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared by a taxidermist.\r\n2. Do not allow the dog to eat at the table, no matter how good his manners.\r\n\r\nPERSONAL HYGIENE\r\n1. While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that should be done in private using one's OWN truck keys.\r\n2. Even if you live alone, deodorant is not a waste of good money.\r\n3. Use of proper toiletries can only delay bathing for a few days.\r\n4. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no, as they tend to detract from a woman's jewelry and alter the taste of finger foods.\r\n\r\nDATING (Outside the Family)\r\n1. Always offer to bait your date's hook, especially on the first date.\r\n2. Be assertive. Let her know you're interested: \"I've been wanting to go out with you since I read that stuff on the bathroom wall two years ago.\"\r\n3. Establish with her parents what time she is expected. Some will say 10:00 pm. Others might say \"Monday\"; if the latter is the answer, it is the man's responsibility to get her to school on time.\r\n\r\nTHEATER ETIQUETTE\r\n1. Crying babies should be taken to the lobby and picked up immediately after the movie has ended.\r\n2. Refrain from talking to characters on the screen. Tests have proven they can't hear you.\r\n\r\nWEDDINGS\r\n1. Livestock, usually, is a poor choice for a wedding gift.\r\n2. In the reception line, kissing the bride for more than 3 seconds may get you shot.\r\n3. For the groom, at least, rent a tux. A leisure suit with a cummerbund and a clean bowling shirt can create a tacky appearance.\r\n\r\nDRIVING ETIQUETTE\r\n1. Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles, even if the gun is loaded and the deer is in your sights.\r\n2. When approaching a four-way stop, the vehicle with the largest tires does not always have the right of way.\r\n3. Never tow another car using panty hose and duct tape.\r\n4. When sending your wife down the road with a gas can, it is impolite to ask her to bring back beer too.\r\n5. Do not lay rubber while traveling in a funeral procession.",

Especially useful for men on Viagra.\r\n\r\nPRYAGRA - About to fail its clinical trial, this drug gave men in the test group an irresistible urge to dig into the personal affairs of other people.

Here are some real examples that have been heard or reported:\r\n\r\n1. From a southwest airlines employee: \"there may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only four ways out of this airplane.\"\r\n\r\n2. Pilot: \"folks, we have reached our cruising altitude now, so I am going to switch the seat belt sign off. Feel free to move about as you wish, but please stay inside the plane till we land. It's a bit cold outside, and if you walk on the wings it affects the flight pattern.\"\r\n\r\n3. After landing: \"thank you for flying delta business express. We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride.\"\r\n\r\n4. As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National, a lone voice came over the loudspeaker: \"whoa, big fella. Whoa!\"\r\n\r\n5. After a particularly rough landing during thunderstorms in Memphis, a flight attendant on a northwest flight announced: \"please take care when opening the overhead compartments because, after a landing like that, sure as hell everything has shifted.\"\r\n\r\n6. From a southwest airlines employee: \"welcome aboard southwest flight xxx to yyy. To operate your seatbelt, insert the metal tab into the buckle and pull tight. It works just like every other seatbelt and if you don't know how to operate one, you probably shouldn't be out in public unsupervised. In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will descend from the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask, and pull it over your face. If you have a small child traveling with you, secure your mask before assisting with theirs. If you are traveling with two small children, decide now which one you love more.\"\r\n\r\n7. \"weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken clouds, but they'll try to have them fixed before we arrive. Thank you, and, remember, nobody loves you or your money more than Southwest airlines.\"\r\n\r\n8. \"your seat cushions can be used for flotation. In the event of an emergency water landing, please take them with our compliments.\"\r\n\r\n9. \"As you exit the plane, please make sure to gather all of your belongings. Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants. But please do not leave children or spouses.\"\r\n\r\n10. \"last one off the plane must clean it.\"\r\n\r\n11. From the pilot during his welcome message: \"we are pleased to have some of the best flight attendants in the industry. Unfortunately, none of them are on this flight.\"\r\n\r\n12. This was overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo, Texas, on a particularly windy and bumpy day. During the final approach, the captain was really having to fight it. After an extremely hard landing, the flight attendant came on the pa and announced, \"ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Amarillo. Please remain in your seats with your seatbelts fastened while the captain taxis what's left of our airplane to the gate!\"\r\n\r\n13. Another flight attendant's comment on a less-than-perfect landing: \"we ask you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal.\"\r\n\r\n14. An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had hammered his ship into the runway really hard. The airline had a policy which required the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited, smile, and give them a, \"thanks for flying xyz airline.\" he said that in light of the bad landing, he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye, thinking that someone would have a smart comment. Finally, everyone had gotten off except for this little old lady walking with a cane. She said, \"sonny, did we land or were we shot down?\"\r\n\r\n15. After a real crusher of a landing in phoenix, the flight attendant got on the pa and said, \"ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats until Captain Crash and the crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt up against the gate. And, once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced, we'll open the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal.\"\r\n\r\n16. Part of a flight attendant's arrival announcement: \"we'd like to thank you folks for flying with us today. And, the next time you get the insane urge to go blasting through the skies in a pressurized metal tube, we hope you'll think of us here at US Airways.\"",

The climate of the Sarah is such that the inhabitants have to live elsewhere.\r\n\r\n2. The Bible is full of interesting caricatures. In the first book of the Bible, Guinessis, Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree. One of their children, Cain, asked, \"Am I my brother's son?\"\r\n\r\n3. Actually, Homer was not written by Homer but by another man of that name.\r\n\r\n4. Eventually, the Romans conquered the Greeks. History calls people Romans because they never stayed in one place for very long.\r\n\r\n5. Nero was a cruel tyranny who would torture his subjects by playing the fiddle to them.\r\n\r\n6. Joan of Arc was burnt to a steak and was cannonized by Bernard Shaw. Finally Magna Carta provided that no man should be hanged twice for the same offense.\r\n\r\n7. In midevil times most people were alliterate. The greatest writer of the futile ages was Chaucer, who wrote many poems and verses and also wrote literature.\r\n\r\n8. Another story was William Tell, who shot an arrow through an apple while standing on his son's head.\r\n\r\n9. During the Renaissance America began. Christopher Columbus was a great navigator who discovered America while cursing about the Atlantic. His ships were called the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Fe.\r\n\r\n10. Later, the Pilgrims crossed the ocean, and this was called Pilgrim's Progress. The winter of 1620 was a hard one for the settlers. Many people died and many babies were born. Captain John Smith was responsible for all this.\r\n\r\n11. One of the causes of the Revolutionary War was the English put tacks in their tea. Also, the colonists would send their parcels through the post without stamps. Finally the colonists won the War and no longer had to pay for taxis. Delegates from the original 13 states formed the Contented Congress. Thomas Jefferson, a Virgin,and Benjamin Franklin were two singers of the Declaration of Independence. Franklin discovered electricity by rubbing two cats backwards and declared, \"A horse divided against itself cannot stand.\". Franklin died in 1790 and is still dead.\r\n\r\n12. Soon the Constitution of the United States was adopted to secure domestic hostility. Under the constitution the people enjoyed the right to keep bare arms.\r\n\r\n13. Meanwhile in Europe, the enlightenment was a reasonable time. Voltaire invented electricity and also wrote a book called Candy.\r\n\r\n14. Gravity was invented by Issac Walton. It is chiefly noticeable in the autumn when the apples are falling off the trees.\r\n\r\n15. The French Revolution was accomplished before it happened and catapulted into Napoleon. Napoleon wanted an heir to inherit his power, but since Josephine was a baroness, she couldn't have any children.\r\n\r\n16. The sun never set on the British Empire because the British Empire is In the East and the sun sets in the West\r\n\r\n17. Queen Victoria was the longest queen. She sat on a thorn for 63 years. She was a moral woman who practiced virtue. Her death was the final event which ended her reign.\r\n\r\n18. Louis Pasteur discovered a cure for rabbis. Charles Darwin was a naturalist who wrote the Organ of the Species. Madman Curie discovered radio. And Karl Marx became one of the Marx brothers.\r\n\r\n19. The First World War, caused by the assignation of the Arch-Duck by an anahist, ushered in a new error in the anals of human history.\r\n\r\nYou would have thought that people doing there GCSE's would have better gnilleps (that spelling spelt backwards) P.S. these are meant to have spelling mistakes, its how they were really wrote by someone.",

Us Texans go across the border all the time and get all the tequila we want.\"\r\n\r\nNot to be outdone, the Californian whipped out a corkscrew and uncorked a bottle of wine. He poured some into a glass, swirled it, sniffed, commented on the tart insolence of its bouquet, sipped, tossed the bottle in the air, nicked it with a round from a silly little chrome-plated pistol, and showered a couple of patrons at the bar with wine.\r\n\r\nThe patrons, upset by the casual waste and general lack of concern for their safety, expressed their displeasure and astonishment, to which the Californian replied, \"Well, I'm from Napa Valley, and we have more than enough wine where I come from.\"\r\n\r\nThe Boulderite, a quiet observer up to this point, touched the crystal hanging from his neck, adjusted his Birkenstocks, flipped back his ponytail, put down his guitar, and borrowed a bottle opener from the bartender. He popped the top off a bottle of Fat Tire beer, hammered it back, threw the empty bottle into the air, pulled a 9mm Beretta, took careful aim, shot both the Californian and the Texan, and caught the falling bottle.\r\n\r\nThe patrons screamed in utter disbelief, \"Why'd you do that?\"\r\n\r\nThe Boulderite replied, \"I'm from Colorado. We've already got too many Texans and way too many  Californians, but glass bottles, now those can be recycled!\"",

She contacted the Vet who told her of an old remedy that was handed down to him by an old Southern lady. He said when the dog began to snore, tie a ribbon around the dog's testicles.\r\n\r\nHoping for a good night sleep, she looked into her sewing kit and found a short piece of red ribbon and placed it on the night stand. When the dog began to snore she got up and delicately tied the red ribbon around the dog's testicles. The dog immediately stopped snoring and stayed asleep. Amazing she thought, and quickly went back to sleep.\r\n\r\nLater that evening, her husband came home from a night out with the boys, stumbled into the bedroom and after undressing, flopped into bed. He immediately began to snore loudly, waking his wife. She reasoned that if it worked for the dog, maybe it would work for her husband. She got up and went to her sewing kit where she found a length of blue ribbon. Quietly and softly she tied the ribbon around her husbands testicles and he immediately quit snoring. She was amazed again and promptly returned to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the husband awoke with a terrible hangover and as he stepped into the bathroom to relieve himself saw the blue ribbon around his testicles. As he walked into the bedroom, he saw the red ribbon around the dog's testicles. Through his haze, he muttered off-handedly to the dog, \"I don't know what we did last night, but at least we finished first and second.\"",

Your sides will be aching before you finish.\r\n\r\n\r\nGarden Snakes are DANGEROUS! \r\nAuthor Unknown \r\n\r\nGreen garden grass snakes can be dangerous. Yes, grass snakes, not rattlesnakes.\r\n\r\nA couple in Sweetwater, Texas had a lot of potted plants, and during a recent cold spell, the wife was bringing a lot of them indoors to protect them from a possible freeze.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that a little green garden grass snake was hidden in one of the plants and when it had warmed up, it slithered out and the wife saw it go under the sofa. She let out a very loud scream.\r\n\r\nThe husband, who was taking a shower, ran out into the living room naked to see what the problem was.\r\n\r\nShe told him there was a snake under the sofa. He got down on the floor on his hands and knees to look for it. About that time the family dog came and cold nosed him on the rear. He thought the snake had bitten him and he fainted.\r\n\r\nHis wife thought he had a heart attack, so she called an ambulance. The attendants rushed in and loaded him on the stretcher and started carrying him out.\r\n\r\nAbout that time the snake came out from under the sofa and one of the Emergency Medical Technicians saw it and dropped his end of the stretcher. That's when the man broke his leg and why he is still in the hospital.\r\n\r\nThe wife still had the problem of the snake in the house, so she called on a neighbor man.\r\n\r\nHe volunteered to capture the snake. He armed himself with a rolled-up newspaper and began poking under the couch. Soon he decided it was gone and told the woman, who sat down on the sofa in relief.\r\n\r\nBut in relaxing, her hand dangled in between the cushion where she felt the snake wriggling around. She screamed and fainted, the snake rushed back under the sofa, and the neighbor man, seeing her laying there passed out tried to use CPR to revive her.\r\n\r\nThe neighbor's wife, who had just returned from shopping at the grocery store, saw her husband's mouth on the woman's mouth and slammed her husband on the back of the head with a bag of canned goods, knocking him out and cutting his scalp to a point where it needed stitches.\r\n\r\nAn ambulance was again called when it was determined that the injury required hospitalization.\r\n\r\nThe noise woke the woman from her dead faint and she saw her neighbor lying on the floor with his wife bending over him, so she assumed he had been bitten by the snake. She went to the kitchen, brought back a small bottle of whiskey, and began pouring it down the man's throat.\r\n\r\nBy now the police had arrived. They saw the unconscious man, smelled the whiskey, and assumed that a drunken fight had occurred. They were about to arrest them all, when the two women tried to explain how it all happened over a little green snake.\r\n\r\nThe ambulance arrived and took away the neighbor and his sobbing wife. Just then the little snake crawled out from under the couch. One of the policemen drew his gun and fired at it. He missed the snake and hit the leg of the end table that was on one side of the sofa. The table fell over and the lamp on it shattered and as the bulb broke, it started a fire in the drapes.\r\n\r\nThe other policeman tried to beat out the flames and fell through the window into the yard on top of the family dog, who startled, jumped up and raced out into the street, where an oncoming car swerved to avoid it and smashed into the parked police car and set it on fire.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the burning drapes had spread to the walls and the entire house was blazing. Neighbors had called the fire department and the arriving fire truck had started raising his ladder when they were halfway down the street. The rising ladder tore out the overhead wires and pulled out the electricity and disconnected telephones in a ten-square city block area.\r\n\r\nTime passed...\r\n\r\nBoth men were discharged from the hospital. The house was re-built. The police acquired a new car, and all was right with the world.\r\n\r\nAbout a year later the original couple were watching TV and the weatherman announced a cold snap for that night. The husband asked his wife if she thought they should bring in their plants for the night.\r\n\r\nShe shot him...",

        "body": "This is not meant to be crude. It is strictly for your edification and enjoyment. \r\n\r\nBefore the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, the French, anticipating victory over the English, proposed to cut off the middle finger of all captured English soldiers. Without their middle finger, it would be impossible to draw the renowned English longbow and therefore they would be incapable of fighting in the future. \r\n\r\nThe longbow was a famous weapon. It was made of the native English Yew tree, and the act of drawing the longbow was known as \"plucking the yew.\" \r\n\r\nMuch to the bewilderment of the French, the English won a major upset and began mocking the French by waving their middle fingers at the defeated French, saying, \"See, we can still pluck yew! PLUCK YEW!\" \r\n\r\nOver the years, some 'folk etymologies' have grown up around this symbolic gesture. Since 'pluck yew' is rather difficult to say (like \"pleasant mother pheasant plucker\", which is who you had to go to for the feathers used on the arrows for the longbow), the difficult consonant cluster at the beginning has gradually changed to a labiodental fricative 'F', and thus the words often used in conjunction with the one-finger-salute are mistakenly thought to have something to do with an intimate encounter. \r\n\r\nIt is also because of the pheasant feathers on the arrows that the symbolic gesture is known as \"giving the bird\". \r\n\r\nAre you not thrilled that you have someone out there that will send you educational stuff like this? \r\n\r\nHistory repeats itself - Once again the appropriate message was given to the French!",

        "body": "The American Dairy Association was so successful with its \"Got Milk?\" campaign, that it was decided to extend the ads to Mexico. Unfortunately, the Spanish translation was \"Are you lactating?\"\r\n\r\nElectrolux, a Scandinavian vacuum manufacturer, used this ad in the U.S.: \"Nothing sucks like an Electrolux.\"\r\n\r\nColgate introduced a toothpaste called \"Cue\" in France, but it turned out to be the same name as a well-known porno magazine.\r\n\r\nWhen Braniff translated a slogan touting its upholstery, \"Fly in leather,\" it came out in Spanish as \"Fly naked.\"\r\n\r\nCoors put its slogan, \"Turn it loose,\" into Spanish, where it was read as \"Suffer from diarrhea.\"\r\n\r\nChicken magnate Frank Perdue's line, \"It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken,\" sounds much more interesting in Spanish: \"It takes a sexually stimulated man to make a chicken affectionate.\"\r\n\r\nBacardi concocted a fruity drink with the name \"Pavian\" to suggest French chic...but \"pavian\" means \"baboon\" in German.\r\n\r\nA hair products company, Clairol, introduced the \"Mist Stick\", a curling iron, into Germany only to find out that mist is slang for manure. Not too many people had use for the manure stick.\r\n\r\nWhen Kentucky Fried Chicken entered the Chinese market, to their horror they discovered that their slogan \"finger lickin' good\" came out as \"eat your fingers off.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Vicks first introduce its cough drops on the German market, they were chagrined to learn that the German pronunciation of \"v\" is f - which in German is the guttural equivalent of \"sexual penetration.\"\r\n\r\nParker Pens translated the slogan for its ink, \"Avoid Embarrassment - Use Quink\" into Spanish as \"Evite Embarazos - Use Quink\"...which also means, \"Avoid Pregnancy - Use Quink.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Pepsi started marketing its products in China a few years back, they translated their slogan, \"Pepsi Brings You Back to Life\" pretty literally. The slogan in Chinese really meant, \"Pepsi Brings Your Ancestors Back from the Grave.\"\r\n\r\nIn Italy, a campaign for \"Schweppes Tonic Water\" translated the name into the much less thirst quenching \"Schweppes Toilet Water.\"\r\n\r\nChinese translation proved difficult for Coke, which took two tries to get it right. They first tried Ke-kou-ke-la because when pronounced it sounded roughly like Coca-Cola. It wasn't until after thousands of signs had been printed that they discovered that the phrase means \"bite the wax tadpole\" or \"female horse stuffed with wax,\" depending on the dialect. Second time around things worked out much better. After researching 40,000 Chinese characters, Coke came up with \"ko-kou-ko-le\" which translates roughly to the much more appropriate \"happiness in the mouth.\"\r\n\r\nNot to be outdone, Puffs Tissues tried later to introduce its product, only to learn that \"Puff\" in German is a colloquial term for a whorehouse. The English weren't too fond of the name either, as it's a highly derogatory term for a non-heterosexual.\r\n\r\nThe Chevy Nova never sold well in Spanish speaking countries. \"No va\" means \"it doesn't go\" in Spanish.\r\n\r\nFord introduced the Pinto in Brazil. After watching sales go nowhere, the company learned that \"Pinto\" is Brazilian slang for \"tiny male genitals.\" Ford pried the nameplates off all of the cars and substituted them with \"Corcel\" which means horse.\r\n\r\nWhen Gerber first started selling baby food in Africa, they used the same packaging as here in the USA - with the cute baby on the label. Later, they found out that in Africa companies routinely put pictures on the label of what's inside since most people can't read.\r\n\r\nIn the French part of Canada, Hunt-Wesson introduced its \"Big John\" products as \"Gros Jos.\" It later found out that the phrase is slang for \"big breasts.\"",

If he asks what sort of books you're interested in, tell him checkbooks.\r\n\r\n14. Remember a sense of humor does not mean that you tell him jokes, it means that you laugh at his.\r\n\r\n15.

This is actually a variation of the phrase \"HEY MOE.\" Its roots go back to a concept pioneered by Moe of the Three Stooges, who discovered that a patient could be made to forget about the pain in his foot if he was poked hard enough in the eyes.\r\n\r\nQ. I just joined an HMO. How difficult will it be to choose the doctor I want?\r\nA . Just slightly more difficult than choosing your parents. Your insurer will provide you with a book listing all the doctors in the plan. These doctors basically fall into two categories - those who are no longer accepting new patients, and those who will see you but are no longer participating in the plan! But don't worry; the remaining doctor who is still in the plan and accepting new patients has an office just a half-day's drive away and has a diploma from a Third World Country.\r\n\r\nQ. Do all diagnostic procedures require pre-certification? \r\nA. No. Only those you need.\r\n\r\nQ. Can I get coverage for my pre-existing conditions?\r\nA. Certainly, as long as they don't require any treatment.\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I want to try alternative forms of medicine?\r\nA. You'll need to find alternative forms of payment.\r\n\r\nQ. My pharmacy plan only covers generic drugs, but I need the name brand. I tried the Generic Medication, but it gave me a stomach ache. What should I do?\r\nA. Poke yourself in the eyes.\r\n\r\nQ. What if I'm away from home and I get sick?\r\nA. You really shouldn't do that.\r\n\r\nQ. I think I need to see a specialist, but my doctor insists he can handle my problem. Can a general practitioner really perform a heart transplant right in his office?\r\nA. Hard to say, but considering that all you're risking is the $15 co-payment, there's no harm in giving him a shot at it.\r\n\r\nQ. Will health care be different in the next century?\r\nA. No. But if you call right now, you might get an appointment by then.",

Infertile couples and old people can't legally get married because the world needs more children.\r\n\r\n3. Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children. \r\n\r\n4. Gay marriage will be less meaningful, since Britney Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage was meaningful.\r\n\r\n5. Heterosexual marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are property, blacks can't marry whites, and divorce is illegal.\r\n\r\n6. Gay marriage should be decided by people not the courts, because the majority-elected legislatures, not courts, have historically protected the rights of the minorities.\r\n\r\n7. Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America.\r\n\r\n8. Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.\r\n\r\n9. Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.\r\n\r\n10. Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why single parents are forbidden to raise children.\r\n\r\n11. Gay marriage will change the foundation of society. Heterosexual marriage has been around for a long time, and we could never adapt to new social norms because we haven't adapted to cars or longer life spans.\r\n\r\n12. Civil unions, providing most of the same benefits as marriage with a different name are better, because a \"separate but equal\" institution is always constitutional. Separate schools for African-Americans worked just as well as separate marriages for gays and lesbians will.",

Ran to the school to pick up the kids and got into an argument with them on the way home. Set out cookies and milk and got the kids organized to do their homework, then set up the ironing board and watched TV while he did the ironing.\r\nAt 4:30 he began peeling potatoes and washing vegetables for salad, breaded the pork chops and snapped fresh beans for supper. After supper he cleaned the kitchen, ran the dishwasher, folded laundry, bathed the kids, and put them to bed.\r\nAt 9 p.m. he was exhausted and, though his daily chores weren't finished, he went to bed where he was expected to make love, which he managed to get through without complaint.\r\nThe next morning, he awoke and immediately knelt by the bed and said, \"Lord, I don't know what I was thinking. I was so wrong to envy my wife's being able to stay home all day. Please, oh please, let us trade back.\"\r\nThe Lord, in his infinite wisdom, replied, \"My son, I feel you have learned your lesson and I will be happy to change things back to the way they were.

So he sent out a declaration throughout the entire known world of that time that he was searching for a CHIEF. A year passed, but only 3 people applied for the very demanding position;\r\n\r\n1. a Japanese Samurai\r\n2. a Chinese Samurai\r\n3. a Jewish Samurai (You snicker!? It is, apparently, possible!)\r\n\r\nThe emperor asked the Japanese Samurai to come in and demonstrate why he should be the chief Samurai. The Japanese Samurai opened a match box, and out popped a bumblebee. Whoosh! went his sword, and the bumblebee dropped dead on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe emperor exclaimed \"That is very impressive!\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor then issued the same challenge to the Chinese Samurai, to come in and demonstrate why he should be chosen. The Chinese samurai also opened a match box and out buzzed a fly. Whoosh, Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! And the fly dropped dead on the ground in four small pieces.\r\n\r\nThe emperor exclaimed: \"That is VERY impressive!\"\r\n\r\nNow the emperor turned to the Jewish Samurai, and asked him to demonstrate why he should be the Chief Samurai. The Jewish Samurai also opened a match box, and out flew a gnat. His flashing sword went Whoosh! But the gnat was still alive and flying around.\r\n\r\nThe emperor, obviously disappointed, said: \"Very ambitious!, but why is that gnat not dead?\"\r\n\r\nThe Jewish Samurai just smiled and said: \"Circumcision is not meant to kill.\"",

A real challenge would be to preach to a bear. One thing led to another, and they decided to do a seven-day experiment.

The bishop is cooming oot next wik to give him fierst communion und confierrmation.\"\r\n\r\nReverend Billy Bob spoke next. He was in a wheelchair, with an arm and both legs in casts, and an IV drip.

And then I began to read to him from God's HOOOOLY WORD! But that bear wanted nothing to do with me. I SAY NO! He wanted NOTHING to do with me. So I took HOOOLD of him and we began to rassle. We rassled down one hill, UP another and DOWN another until we come to a crick. So I quick DUNK him and BAPTIZE his hairy soul. An' jus like you sez, he wuz gentle as a lamb. We spent the rest of the week in fellowship, feasting on God's HOOOOLY word.\"\r\n\r\nThey both look down at the rabbi, who was lying in a hospital bed.
